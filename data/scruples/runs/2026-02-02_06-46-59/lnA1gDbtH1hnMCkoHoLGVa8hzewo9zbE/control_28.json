Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, a recent death, and children who already attended viewings but didn't want to go to the burial.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've been through a lot emotionally with their grandfather's death and had to see him in the casket. They were already at the viewings, which were hard on them. Now the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They don't want to go again. The author respects their wishes and sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author explained the kids' feelings.\n\nI need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids can't handle multiple funerals easily. The author prioritized their children's emotional health and school obligations. Forcing them to attend might cause more trauma. The author also explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so maybe the upset is more about the family's expectations rather than the kids' needs.\n\nThe key points are the kids' well-being, their own wishes, and the practical aspects of school. The author isn't forcing them to attend, they're respecting the kids' feelings. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
