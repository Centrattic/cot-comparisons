Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether sending kids to school instead of a grandfather's burial makes the parent the asshole. The parent is divorced from the kids' father. The grandfather died, and the kids missed school for viewings on Friday and Saturday. Now the burial is on Monday, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning: the kids were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in a casket. They had a hard time processing the death, especially since he was the first family member they knew well. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go to the burial. The parent didn't force them, respecting their wishes. The parent is focused on the kids' emotional well-being.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because the family might expect the kids to attend the burial. But the parent is prioritizing the children's needs. The kids have school responsibilities, tests, and the parent is trying to balance their emotional state with their academic obligations. \n\nIs the parent wrong for not forcing the kids? Well, forcing kids to attend a burial when they're emotionally overwhelmed and don't want to go seems harsh. The parent considered their feelings and the kids' own wishes. The parent also explained the situation to the ex-MIL, which shows they tried to handle it respectfully. \n\nThe parent's actions seem reasonable. The key points are the children's emotional state, their own wishes, and the parent's effort to protect them. So, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
