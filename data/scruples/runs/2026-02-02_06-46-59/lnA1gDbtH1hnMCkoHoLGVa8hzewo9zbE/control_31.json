Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings, which were emotional and hard for them. The grandfather was a significant figure in their lives, and this is their first family member to pass away. They were already upset during the viewings and the wake. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves don't want to go, saying they've already said goodbye. The author respects their wishes and sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here: the children's emotional well-being versus the expectation to attend the burial. The author is prioritizing the kids' needs and their own comfort. The kids are young and have been through a lot already. Forcing them to attend might cause more trauma. The author explains their decision and the kids' feelings, which seems reasonable. The ex-MIL's reaction is perhaps more about her own feelings or expectations, not the children's best interest. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation that children must attend such events? In some cultures, yes, but the author is considering the kids' readiness. The author also had the kids attend the viewings, which were already difficult. The burial is a more solemn event, and the kids have already expressed they're done. The school tests add another layer\u2014maybe the timing is tough, but the author's decision to prioritize the kids' emotional state over the funeral seems justified. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. They made a compassionate choice based on the children's needs and their own wishes. The answer should be B.\n"
