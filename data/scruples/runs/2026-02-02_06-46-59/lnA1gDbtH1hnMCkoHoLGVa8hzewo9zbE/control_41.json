Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and they already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotional. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They themselves declined to go to the burial, saying they'd already said goodbye. The author chose to send them to school, and the ex-MIL is upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the factors. The children's well-being is a big part here. Young kids can be traumatized by funerals, especially if they're already upset. The author prioritized their emotional state and their school commitment. The kids had already been to the viewings, which were harder for them. Forcing them to go again might not be in their best interest.\n\nAlso, the author is a single parent, divorced from the ex, and they don't get along well. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author had to make a decision that's best for the kids. The kids themselves didn't want to go, which is a key point. Parents often rely on their children's wishes, especially when it comes to emotional events.\n\nThere's also the practical aspect\u2014the burial is on a school day, and the kids have tests. Missing school could affect their education, but the author might have considered that the emotional impact of the funeral would be worse. The military burial adds to the formality, but the kids were already present at the earlier events.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is important for closure. But given the kids' age and emotional state, maybe it's better to let them process at their own pace. The author explained the situation to the ex-MIL, which shows they tried to be respectful, even if the decision was hard.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision seems to be in the best interest of the children. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
