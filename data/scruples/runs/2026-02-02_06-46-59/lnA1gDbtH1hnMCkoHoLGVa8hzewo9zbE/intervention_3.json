Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. Let me start by going through the details.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and they missed school on Friday for the viewings and the wake on Saturday. Now, the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go to the burial, and they said no. The author sent them to school, and the ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the children's well-being. The kids were already emotionally affected by the viewings and the wake. They had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket and were crying. Forcing them to attend the burial might add more stress, especially since they felt they had already said goodbye. The burial is a more formal event, and maybe the kids aren't ready for that. The author mentioned that the kids are young and dealing with their first significant loss in the family. It's important to prioritize their emotional health here.\n\nThen, there's the ex-MIL's reaction. She's upset that the kids aren't attending. But the author explained that the kids didn't want to go. The author isn't forcing the kids; they're respecting the children's wishes. The ex-MIL might be upset because of cultural expectations or personal feelings, but the author's priority is the kids' comfort. \n\nSchool is also a factor. The kids have tests on Monday, which is a school day. Missing school could affect their academic progress. The author has a responsibility to balance family obligations with their children's education. The ex-MIL's family is attending, so the kids aren't the only ones not there. \n\nThe author's relationship with the ex is strained, and the ex-MIL's reaction is very upset. But the author is acting in the best interest of the children. The kids expressed their own feelings about not wanting to attend, so forcing them might be more harmful. \n\nI think the key points are the children's emotional state, their expressed wishes, and the educational impact. The author is making a decision based on what's best for the children, not avoiding responsibility to the ex-MIL. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
