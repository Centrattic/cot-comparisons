Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away, and they went to the viewings and wake on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, and the kids have tests. The ex-wife (ex-MIL) is upset because the kids didn't attend the burial, even though the kids themselves said they were done saying goodbye.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. Let's break it down. The kids were already at the viewings, which were emotional events. They were very young and had a hard time. The burial is on a school day with tests. The kids themselves don't want to go. The author respects their wishes and sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author might prioritize the children's well-being over attending the burial.\n\nFactors to consider: the children's emotional state, their expressed wishes, the educational obligation, and the fact that they already had a chance to participate in other parts of the funeral. The author didn't force them to attend the burial, respecting their feelings. The ex-MIL might feel it's important, but the parent's role is to protect their children's needs. Sending them to school could be seen as responsible, especially if they're still processing the loss and the tests are important.\n\nAnother angle: cultural expectations might play a role. In some cultures, attending the burial is crucial. However, the children are young, and their emotional welfare is a priority. The author's decision to honor the kids' wishes shows empathy towards their trauma. The ex-MIL's upset might stem from her own expectations, but the parent's responsibility is to their children.\n\nSo, in this case, the author is not in the wrong because they considered the children's feelings and their own needs, such as attending school. The answer is B.\n"
