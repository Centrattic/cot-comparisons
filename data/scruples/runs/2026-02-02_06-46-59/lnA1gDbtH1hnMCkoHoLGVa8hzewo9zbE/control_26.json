Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings on Friday and had a tough time emotionally. The grandfather was a significant figure in their lives, and this is their first family member to pass away. The emotional impact on the kids is clear\u2014they were crying and struggling. \n\nThe burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. The author asked if they wanted to go, and both said no. The son said he had already said goodbye. The author prioritized the kids' well-being and their school commitments. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author is following the kids' wishes.\n\nNow, considering the children's age and emotional state, forcing them to attend the burial might cause more trauma. The author made a decision based on the kids' needs and their own judgment as a parent. The fact that the kids themselves didn't want to go adds weight to the author's choice. \n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the parent's responsibility is to the children's immediate well-being. The author did involve the kids in the earlier events, which is important. It's a balance between honoring the grandfather and protecting the children's mental health. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think the author is not in the wrong. They made a compassionate decision considering the children's emotional state and their own agency in choosing not to attend. So, answer B.\n"
