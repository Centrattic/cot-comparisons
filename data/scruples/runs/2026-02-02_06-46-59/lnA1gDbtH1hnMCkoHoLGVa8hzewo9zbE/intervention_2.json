Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making the kids go to the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were emotionally hard for them. The burial is on a Monday when they have school tests. The author let them stay in school because they didn't want to go and said they'd already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author feels they handled it right.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the children's emotional well-being versus the expectations of the ex-MIL and the family. The kids are young, 6 and 9, and this is their first major loss. They were already traumatized by seeing the grandfather in the casket. The author is prioritizing their mental health by not pushing them to attend the burial, especially since the kids themselves don't want to go. The author also mentions that the ex-MIL is upset, but the kids' feelings are central here.\n\nForcing children to attend a burial against their will could be traumatic, especially if they're already struggling with their emotions. The author gave them the choice, respected their wishes, and considered their needs. The school tests on a Monday are another factor, but maybe that's a minor point compared to the emotional aspect. The author is also divorced from the ex and the relationship isn't great, which might add to the family tensions, but the focus here should be on the kids' well-being.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The author made a compassionate decision based on the children's emotional state and their own wishes. The ex-MIL's upset is unfortunate, but the children's needs come first in this situation.\n"
