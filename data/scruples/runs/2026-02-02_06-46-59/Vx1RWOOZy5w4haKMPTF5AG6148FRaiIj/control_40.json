Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a best friend (Tammy) who is getting married, and the groom is the author's ex-boyfriend (Gregory). The author is upset and doesn't want to be the maid of honor, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships and the dynamics here. The author and Tammy are best friends since childhood, like sisters. The author and Gregory had a long, on-again-off-again relationship. Tammy ended up with Gregory, leading to this conflict.\n\nThe author is hurt because the two people she loves are now a couple. She feels it's unfair or too painful to be part of their wedding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor.\n\nLet me break down the key points. The author's reasons for not wanting to be the maid of honor are emotional. She loves Tammy but is dealing with the pain of her best friend marrying her ex. She's not angry at Tammy but feels sad and can't handle being around them during this time. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's understandable to be hurt. Even if the relationships were complicated, the fact that the two people she cares about are now together could lead to feelings of jealousy, loss, or sadness. Being the maid of honor would require her to be a part of the wedding planning and event, which might be too emotionally taxing for her right now. \n\nTammy, on the other hand, is asking for the author's support as her best friend. She might feel rejected or hurt if the author declines, especially since she had always envisioned the author as her maid of honor. However, the author clearly communicated her feelings, even though it's painful for both sides. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her emotional well-being. It's important to acknowledge that people have different coping mechanisms. If the author isn't ready to be part of the wedding, it's her right to say no. However, it's possible that the author could have handled the situation with more grace or provided some closure, but the core issue is her emotional response. \n\nThe situation is complex because it involves two important people in the author's life. The author isn't being malicious; she's going through a tough time. While it's a difficult position for Tammy, the author isn't obligated to put herself through emotional pain for the sake of the wedding. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
