Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at their best friend's wedding when she's marrying the author's ex. The author feels hurt because their best friend is now pregnant with their ex's child and getting married. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is clearly hurt and feels betrayed. They have a close relationship with Tammy, who is marrying Gregory, their ex. The author's reaction is emotional, which is understandable given the situation. They feel that Tammy and Gregory are a better match than they ever were, which adds to the hurt.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the main question is whether the author's refusal to be the maid of honor is selfish or justified. Being the maid of honor is a significant role that requires emotional support and presence. If the author can't be emotionally supportive due to personal pain, it's reasonable for them to decline. They're not betraying Tammy; they're being honest about their feelings.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should put their feelings aside for their friend. But given the circumstances\u2014being the best friend and then finding out about the relationship with their ex\u2014it's a complex emotional situation. The author isn't cutting off Tammy entirely; they just can't handle the wedding role right now. They're still being an aunt and supporting her in other ways.\n\nAlso, considering that Tammy approached the author about being the maid of honor, and the author's refusal is a result of their pain, it's more about personal boundaries and emotional health. There's no indication the author is being malicious or cruel beyond expressing their inability to take on the role.\n\nSo, based on that, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their emotional well-being and being honest about their feelings, which is a valid response in this situation.\n"
