Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend who's getting married to her ex. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and Tammy are best friends since childhood. The author also dated Gregory, her ex, and they had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship. Tammy, who had been struggling to make friends, started hanging out with Gregory (the author's ex) and eventually they ended up together and she's pregnant. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be involved in the wedding, even going as far as saying she can't attend.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's perspective is that she's hurt and feels that Tammy and Gregory make a better couple, but she's upset because they're together. She's not mad at Tammy but is emotionally affected. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, the author is a best friend who's been close for years. But when her best friend starts a relationship with her ex, especially after some back and forth, it's understandable that she's conflicted. The ex and Tammy are getting married, and the author is supposed to be the maid of honor. \n\nThe author's refusal is based on her emotional state. She's not acting out of malice but because she's hurt. The ex and Tammy's relationship seems to have developed while the author was still in the loop, maybe even encouraging Tammy to meet Gregory. The author might feel betrayed that they didn't respect her feelings, even though they tried to break up before but couldn't. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the author isn't obligated to be the maid of honor. If she's genuinely hurt and can't attend, she's not being inconsiderate in that sense. However, she is a close friend, and walking away might hurt Tammy. But the scenario suggests that Tammy is the one who started the relationship, so the author's refusal isn't entirely her fault. \n\nThe author's response was to cut off contact and cry, which is a natural reaction. While it's possible that she could have handled it more gracefully, like explaining her feelings without cutting her friend off, the main issue is her right to decline a role she's not comfortable with. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with a complex emotional situation and has the right to prioritize her well-being.\n"
