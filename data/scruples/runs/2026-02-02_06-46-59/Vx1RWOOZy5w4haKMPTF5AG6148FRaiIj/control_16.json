Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding when the friend is marrying the author's ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, let's call her Person A, has a best friend Tammy since childhood. They're very close. Then there's Gregory, Person A's ex-boyfriend. They had a complicated on-and-off relationship. Gregory moved away but they stayed in touch. \n\nTammy moved to a city near Gregory and asked him to introduce her to his friends, which he did. That might have set the stage for their relationship. Gregory stopped texting Person A, which could be a red flag, but Person A didn't realize it at the time. Then Tammy reveals she's pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. Person A is hurt and refuses to be the maid of honor or attend the wedding.\n\nSo the question is whether Person A is wrong for not wanting to be involved in the wedding. \n\nPerson A is clearly hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex. It's a complicated mix of personal history and betrayal. But is it fair for her to refuse the role? Let's consider the dynamics.\n\nTammy is asking for the maid of honor role, which is a big commitment. Person A is in a lot of emotional pain. The fact that Tammy and Gregory are a perfect match from Person A's own assessment might add to the hurt, feeling like they've moved on without her. \n\nBut Tammy is a close friend. Refusing the role could be seen as cutting off a friend during a significant life event. However, Person A might not be in a good emotional state to handle the responsibilities of the maid of honor. Also, she might not feel like she can be there without being hurt or causing problems.\n\nThe key here is whether Person A's decision is selfish or justified. If she's not ready to be around them due to her feelings, it's understandable. But she's not just refusing to attend; she's declining a role that's important to Tammy. Tammy might see it as rejection, especially after the apology and hoping for understanding.\n\nBut the story says that Tammy approached Person A with the news, and Person A's reaction was one of sadness and hurt, not anger at Tammy. She tried to keep her cool but lost it. She's not being malicious, just overwhelmed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author isn't in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own emotional well-being. It's her right to step back if she can't handle being part of the wedding. However, it might affect her relationship with Tammy. \n\nBut the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since she's not being cruel or intentionally hurting them, just unable to be there, it's more about her emotional state. So the answer would likely be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
