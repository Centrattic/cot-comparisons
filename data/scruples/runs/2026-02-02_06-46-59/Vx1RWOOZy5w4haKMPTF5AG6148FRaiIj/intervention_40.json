Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor when her best friend is marrying her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close friends with Tammy, her best friend, and had a romantic relationship with Gregory. They broke up, but stayed in touch. Tammy moved near Gregory, started seeing him, got pregnant, and now they're getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor or attend the wedding. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the emotional impact on the author versus Tammy's request. The author is clearly hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex. Even though she loves Tammy, the situation is causing her a lot of pain. The question is whether she's obligated to be the maid of honor despite her feelings.\n\nI think the main factors here are consent and emotional well-being. Being a maid of honor is a big commitment that involves emotional support. If the author is too hurt to do that, it's reasonable for her to decline. It's not fair to force someone into a role that would cause them significant distress. The author is protecting her own mental health, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, Tammy might feel rejected or hurt by the refusal. But the author isn't being cruel; she's just not able to handle the situation right now. The story mentions that the author tried to stay calm but couldn't. That shows she's not being malicious. The fact that they're getting married now complicates things, but the author's feelings are valid.\n\nI should also consider if there's any betrayal or if the author has a right to be upset. Greg and Tammy started dating after the author ended their relationship. The author might feel like they went behind her back or that Tammy didn't consider her feelings. However, the author admitted they never discussed future plans. So maybe Tammy didn't owe her anything. Still, the emotional hurt is real.\n\nIn terms of social obligations, the maid of honor role is typically for someone who supports the couple. If the author can't support them emotionally, it's not fair to take on that role. It's better to be honest and decline, even if it's uncomfortable. The author isn't refusing just because of the relationship; it's because of the hurt from the situation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's choosing her well-being and honesty over the social expectation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
