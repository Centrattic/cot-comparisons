Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding when her friend is marrying her ex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the relationships between the author, Tammy (best friend), and Gregory (ex-boyfriend). Tammy is marrying Gregory, and the author is upset because they were her best friend and she's now in a relationship with her ex, who she had a complicated history with. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be involved in the wedding, which is causing tension.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on emotional hurt. They feel betrayed because Tammy, the best friend, is marrying the ex. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014being in love with someone and then finding out your best friend is in a relationship with them, especially resulting in a pregnancy and marriage, would be incredibly painful. The author is not angry at Tammy but is struggling with the emotional impact.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Being a maid of honor is a significant role, often expected to be supportive and present at the wedding. The author is choosing not to participate, which could disappoint Tammy. But is that wrong?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're dealing with personal trauma and emotional distress. They might not be able to support the wedding in a positive way. The story mentions that Tammy knew about the author's feelings towards Gregory (since the author had a long-term boyfriend relationship), and that the ex's texts stopped before the relationship started. The author wasn't aware of the pregnancy or the impending marriage, which adds to the shock and hurt.\n\nTammy's actions might be seen as insensitive, but she's also trying to maintain the friendship. However, the author's right to prioritize their own emotional well-being is important. It's not necessarily about being in the wrong, but about whether the author's refusal is justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn many cases, people do step down from wedding roles if they feel they can't be supportive. The key is whether the author is being selfish or if they have a legitimate reason. The author clearly states their reasons are emotional pain and inability to be present for the wedding. The fact that they were trying to help Tammy by introducing her to Gregory's friends complicates things, but it doesn't make the author's feelings invalid.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason to decline the role due to their emotional state. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
