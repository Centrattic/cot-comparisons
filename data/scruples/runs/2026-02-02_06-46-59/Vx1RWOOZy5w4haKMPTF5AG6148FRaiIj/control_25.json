Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend Tammy, who is getting married to the author's ex-boyfriend Gregory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Tammy are really close friends, lifelong. Gregory was the author's on-again, off-again college boyfriend. The author didn't think they'd end up together, but Tammy, who's now pregnant with Gregory's baby and getting married to him, wants the author to be her maid of honor.\n\nThe author is hurt because their best friend is marrying their ex. They feel like Tammy and Gregory are a better match and are struggling to accept this. The author is refusing to be part of the wedding party and even attending the wedding, which is causing Tammy to apologize repeatedly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Emotional Response**: The author is feeling devastated and hurt. It's natural to feel that way when a close friend marries an ex. The author's reaction is based on emotional pain, which isn't necessarily wrong. People have the right to their feelings.\n\n2. **Friendship Dynamics**: Tammy and the author are best friends. The author might feel betrayed or replaced, especially since Tammy approached Gregory, who was a mutual connection. But Tammy's intention was to seek support, according to the story.\n\n3. **Responsibility to Attend or Participate**: Being a maid of honor is a big role, but it's also a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to take on that role, especially if they can't be there emotionally. The author might not be ready to attend the wedding at all, which is a valid decision if they need space to heal.\n\n4. **Communication and Boundaries**: The author communicated their feelings to Tammy, even though it was difficult. While it's clear the author is hurt, they are being honest about their inability to participate. Honesty in setting boundaries is generally considered okay, even if it's painful for the other person.\n\n5. **Potential for Being an Asshole**: The author isn't being malicious. They're not attacking Tammy or Gregory publicly or trying to sabotage the wedding. They're just prioritizing their own emotional well-being. However, the author is making Tammy feel rejected, which might be hurtful. But given the circumstances, it's a tough spot.\n\n6. **Alternatives**: Maybe the author could have suggested another role or taken time to process before declining. But the story mentions the author tried to keep cool but lost it. It's possible they didn't have time to process and are still in the immediate aftermath of the shock.\n\n7. **Cultural Expectations**: In some contexts, declining to be a maid of honor might be seen as a betrayal. However, the author's relationship with the groom also complicates this. It's a unique situation where the roles are intertwined with their own heartbreak.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and need time to heal. The key here is the intention and the communication. The author is honest about their hurt and isn't acting out of spite but sadness. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
