Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding when her friend is marrying her ex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has two major parts of her life: Tammy, her best friend since childhood, and Gregory, her ex-boyfriend. Tammy got pregnant with Gregory's baby and they're getting married. The author was supposed to be the maid of honor but is now refusing. \n\nThe key points here are the relationships and the emotional impact. The author is hurt because the two people she loved ended up together, which she feels has caused her pain. However, it's important to consider if her reaction is justified. Tammy is her best friend, and being a maid of honor is a significant role. The author is refusing to attend the wedding or be part of the wedding party, which could hurt Tammy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she's going through a lot of emotional pain, and it's natural to feel hurt when someone close moves on in a way that feels personal. On the other hand, being a maid of honor is a big commitment, and the author might not be in a place emotionally to take on that role, especially given the circumstances with her ex. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of loyalty to a best friend. If Tammy is still a close friend, refusing to be part of the wedding might be seen as prioritizing the pain over the friendship. However, the author might not be ready to be around them both, especially if being there could lead to more hurt. It's a complex situation where personal feelings clash with friendship and family expectations.\n\nThe story mentions that Tammy apologized and tried to reach out, but the author couldn't handle it. Maybe the author needs to take time to process her emotions before making a decision. But she's already declined the role, so the question is about whether that was the wrong choice.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author is hurting from the betrayal (though it's unclear if Tammy had intentions to betray her), she might not be in the wrong for needing space. However, refusing to support her best friend's big day could strain their friendship. It's a tough call. The answer depends on whether the author's feelings are valid and if she's being reasonable in her refusal. \n\nGiven that the author is clearly hurt and the situation is a mix of personal and friendship issues, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong, but she should communicate better to maintain the friendship. So, the answer is B.\n"
