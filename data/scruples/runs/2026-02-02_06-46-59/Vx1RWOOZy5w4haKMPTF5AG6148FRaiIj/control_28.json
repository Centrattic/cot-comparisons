Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend who is marrying her ex. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is close to Tammy, her best friend since childhood. She's also had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship with Gregory, her ex. They were never official for good reasons, but they stayed in touch. Tammy moved near Gregory, got introduced to his friends, and eventually they ended up together, leading to pregnancy and marriage. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor. The main question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nTo decide, I should consider the dynamics here. The author is upset because her best friend is marrying her ex. It's a personal situation where she's feeling betrayed or hurt. But is she wrong for not wanting to be involved in the wedding? The key points are her emotional response and Tammy's request.\n\nFirst, being a maid of honor is a big commitment. The author is clearly emotional and not ready to handle that role. She loves Tammy but is hurt by the relationship with Gregory. The user might think that as a best friend, she should support Tammy regardless. However, the author has a right to her feelings. It's not about wrong, but about personal boundaries and emotional readiness.\n\nAlso, the situation is complicated because Gregory was her ex, and the fact that they ended up together adds to the author's pain. The author isn't mad at Tammy, just sad and hurt. She's not refusing to attend the wedding; she's just not taking the role. So, the question is whether she's obligated to be the maid of honor despite her feelings.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people take roles in weddings even if there's tension, but it's not a legal or binding commitment. The author isn't doing anything harmful beyond declining the role. Tammy might be disappointed, but the author has her reasons. The answer likely hinges on whether declining the role is seen as a betrayal. Given that the author explains her reasons and the complexity of the situation, she's probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
