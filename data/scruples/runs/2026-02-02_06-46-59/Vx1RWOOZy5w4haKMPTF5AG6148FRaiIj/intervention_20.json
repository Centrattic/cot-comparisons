Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor because her best friend is pregnant and marrying her ex. \n\nFirst, the author has known Tammy since elementary school, so there's a long-standing friendship. They're close, like sisters. Then there's Gregory, her ex, who she had an on-again, off-again relationship with. The author introduced Tammy to Gregory so she could meet people, which worked out, but then the ex and her best friend ended up together and having a kid.\n\nThe author is hurt because her ex and best friend are getting married. She's not mad at Tammy but feels betrayed. She declined being the maid of honor, even before discussing it, just said she couldn't be around them. The question is whether she's the asshole for not wanting to take on that role.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's hurt feelings, the suddenness of the rejection, and the fact that she didn't even discuss it with Tammy before declining. The maid of honor is a big role, and Tammy had already approached her with the request. The author's reaction might be seen as cutting off a close friend, which could be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the situation is complex. The author wasn't the one to initiate the relationship between Tammy and Gregory. She even facilitated their meeting. The betrayal might feel personal. But as a friend, even if hurt, the author's refusal without communication could be seen as selfish. The maid of honor role is significant, and Tammy might feel abandoned. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author has every right to feel hurt and might not be ready to handle the emotional strain of being part of the wedding. It's a personal decision, and while it's hurtful, it's not necessarily wrong. The author's honesty might help Tammy find someone else, though it's awkward. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe it's not a clear-cut case. However, considering the context, the author could have handled it differently, like talking it through instead of just cutting off contact. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she didn't mean to be harsh and is genuinely hurt, maybe she's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
