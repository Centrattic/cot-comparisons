Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, especially since the friend is marrying her ex. The situation is complicated with a lot of history.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships. The author is close friends with Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They've shared a lot of experiences and are like sisters. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-college boyfriend. They had an on-again, off-again relationship. The author never explicitly told Gregory that they should get back together, and they both had other dating lives. \n\nTammy moved to a city near Gregory, and the author suggested Tammy reach out to him for social connections. That led to Tammy and Gregory getting together, resulting in a pregnancy and marriage. The author is hurt because her best friend is marrying her ex, and she doesn't want to be part of the wedding. \n\nThe key points here: The author didn't force Tammy and Gregory to get together; she just suggested Tammy connect with Gregory's friends. The ex relationship is over, and both parties had their own dating lives. The author is hurt but not necessarily at fault in the situation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't obligated to be the maid of honor. Being hurt and needing space is understandable. The fact that Tammy apologized and tried to reach out shows she didn't want to hurt the author. The author's feelings are valid, and walking away isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to prioritize her feelings, even if it means declining the role. The situation is messy, but her hurt doesn't make her the asshole.\n"
