Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for their best friend Tammy, who is marrying their ex Gregory. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Tammy are best friends since childhood. Gregory was the author's college boyfriend, and they had an on-again, off-again relationship. The author helped Tammy connect with Gregory because Tammy was lonely. Then Tammy got pregnant with Gregory's baby and they're getting married. The author feels hurt and doesn't want to be part of the wedding, which has caused some conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but the answer could go either way. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in feeling hurt. They had a close relationship with Tammy and a past relationship with Gregory. The fact that Tammy and Gregory ended up together, especially in a way that involves the author's ex, can be really painful. The author's reaction is emotional, and they're not in the best state to handle the wedding role. It's their right to step back and take time to heal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a best friend, and the maid of honor is a significant role in a wedding. Refusing to take part might hurt Tammy, even if the author is hurt. The author might be prioritizing their own feelings over their friend's needs. However, the author isn't saying they won't attend the wedding, just not take on the Maid of Honor role. That's a big difference. The author could still attend as a guest, which might help Tammy feel supported.\n\nAnother point is the author's history with Gregory. They had a complicated relationship, and it's natural to feel conflicted. The fact that Tammy and Gregory are a good match might also add to the author's feelings of inadequacy or loss. But the author's main issue is about being the maid of honor, not about attending the wedding.\n\nThe responsibility of the maid of honor is a big commitment, involving planning and emotional support. If the author isn't emotionally ready to take on that role, it's reasonable to decline. They aren't in the wrong for needing that space. The key is whether the author is being selfish by refusing the role or if it's a valid emotional decision.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They have a right to protect their emotional well-being. The situation is complex, and their feelings are valid. They can still be supportive in other ways without taking on the maid of honor role. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
