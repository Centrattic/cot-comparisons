Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, considering her friend is marrying her ex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is close friends with Tammy since childhood, and Tammy is getting married to Gregory, the author's ex. The author is hurt and feels conflicted about being the maid of honor. The main question is whether not wanting to be the maid of honor makes the author the asshole.\n\nLet me consider the relationships involved. The author and Tammy are best friends, which is a long-standing relationship. Then there's Gregory, the ex. The author tried to help Tammy connect with Gregory's friends, which eventually led to Tammy and Gregory getting together. Now, the author is hurt because Tammy is marrying her ex, even though the author had a long, on-again-off-again relationship with Gregory.\n\nThe author's refusal to be the maid of honor is based on personal feelings. They're hurt because the two people they love are getting married, and they feel their ex and best friend chose each other over them. But is that a valid reason to refuse the role?\n\nIn terms of social norms, being a maid of honor is a significant role. It's expected that the maid of honor supports the bride, but in this case, the bride is marrying someone the maid of honor has a complicated history with. The author might not be able to perform the role effectively if they're too emotionally involved or hurt.\n\nHowever, being a maid of honor is also a personal decision. The role requires emotional support and being there for the bride, which might be impossible if the maid of honor is still emotionally attached to the groom. The author might not be in a place to handle the wedding positively, which could affect their ability to fulfill the role properly. Additionally, the situation is complicated by the fact that the author's ex is marrying their best friend, which is a unique set of circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the bride (Tammy) might feel rejected if the author refuses. The author was supposed to be her maid of honor, and turning it down could hurt Tammy's feelings. But the author is also justified in needing to take care of their own emotional well-being. They can't be a good maid of honor if they're too upset to participate fully.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries for their own emotional health. The situation is complicated, and the author's feelings are valid given the history with both Tammy and Gregory. The key point is whether the author can fulfill the role effectively. If they can't, then refusing is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their decision is based on their own emotional state and the unique circumstances, which are understandable given the relationships involved.\n"
