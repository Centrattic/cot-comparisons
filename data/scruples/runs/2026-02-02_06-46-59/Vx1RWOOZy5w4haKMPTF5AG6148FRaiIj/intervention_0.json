Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, given that her friend is getting married to the author's ex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author has been best friends with Tammy for a long time, considering her a sister. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex, who they had on-again, off-again relationship with. Tammy started seeing Gregory after moving to the same city as him, and now she's pregnant with his child and they're getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be involved in the wedding party.\n\nThe author's main points are that they're hurt because their best friend is marrying their ex, which they feel is a betrayal or at least a situation they can't handle emotionally. They also acknowledge that Tammy and Gregory are a perfect match, but that doesn't help with their personal feelings. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining to be maid of honor.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Tammy approached the author to be her maid of honor, but the author is hurt and doesn't want to be part of the wedding. The author wasn't angry at Tammy but was very sad. They also mention that they couldn't be around Tammy after finding out. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor? Well, being a maid of honor is a big role that requires emotional support and participation. If the author is too hurt to fulfill that role, it's reasonable for them to step back. They aren't obligated to attend, let alone take on a major role in the wedding if it's going to be too emotionally taxing.\n\nOn the other hand, Tammy might feel rejected or that the author's decision is a betrayal, especially since she asked the author to be her maid of honor. However, the author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. The author is dealing with two significant people in their life getting together, which is a personal loss even if the other two are happy.\n\nAlso, considering that the author didn't know about the pregnancy and the wedding plans until Tammy told them, there's no indication the author was involved in the decision-making. So, the author's reaction is about their own emotional state rather than any wrongdoing on their part. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their mental health and emotional well-being. The mistake might be in how they communicated their decision, but the decision itself isn't morally wrong. The author is not obligated to support a relationship that caused them pain, especially if they can't be present for the wedding without it affecting them negatively.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for not being able to take on the role, and their feelings are justified given the situation.\n"
