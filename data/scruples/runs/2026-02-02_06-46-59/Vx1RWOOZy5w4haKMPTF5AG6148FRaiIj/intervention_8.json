Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has a best friend named Tammy, who's like a sister. They've been super close through college, roomed together, and all. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-college boyfriend. They had a complicated on-again, off-again relationship, and now he's moving to a different city. The author never told Gregory about wanting to be with him long-term, but they still stayed in touch, sending flirty texts and going on vacations. \n\nThen Tammy moves closer to Gregory. The author suggests she call him to meet new friends. Tammy does, and the author notices Gregory's flirty texts stop. Later, Tammy reveals she's pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author is sad and can't handle being the maid of honor. They couldn't even go to the wedding, let alone be in the wedding party. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the relationships involved. The author and Gregory were in a relationship, but it was on-again, off-again. The author admits they didn't tell Gregory about their long-term hopes. Gregory also had his own dating life, so he was emotionally available. Tammy, upon moving closer, connected with Gregory, and they started dating. The author is hurt because they're now involved with the ex, and the author was supposed to be the maid of honor. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor. Let's consider the dynamics. Tammy and Gregory didn't start seeing each other while the author was in a relationship with Gregory, right? The author was the one who suggested Tammy reach out to Gregory. Also, the author and Gregory were never in a committed, long-term exclusive relationship. They had a history of breaking up, and the author hoped they'd grow up and stay together. But Gregory moved away, and their relationship was on-again, off-again. So maybe the author still had feelings for Gregory even after they broke up. \n\nTammy is now pregnant with Gregory's child, and they're getting married. The author is upset, not angry at Tammy. The author is trying to process the hurt. The key here is the author's feelings and their right to feel that way. The maid of honor role is significant and can be emotionally taxing. If the author is in a state of emotional turmoil because their ex is marrying their best friend, it's understandable that they might not want to take on that role. \n\nBut wait, the author suggested Tammy talk to Gregory. That's an important point. Because they thought it would help Tammy make friends. Did the author know that Gregory had feelings for Tammy or vice versa? Not necessarily. But by facilitating their connection, maybe the author played a role in their relationship. However, the author wasn't in a current relationship with Gregory at the time. \n\nThe author is not mad at Tammy but is hurt. The wedding is happening, and the author is struggling to be part of it. The author's feelings are valid. They have every right to feel pain from the situation. The maid of honor role requires close involvement, and if the author isn't emotionally ready to support Tammy in that context, they can't be forced to do so. \n\nHowever, the author is considered someone Tammy would naturally turn to for the role. But the author is clearly not in a place where they can handle it. The question is about whether it's wrong to decline. In such cases, it's about the right to make personal decisions based on emotional well-being. So the author isn't being an asshole for prioritizing their own feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe Tammy's feelings are more hurt by the author's refusal. But the author's response was about being overwhelmed and not wanting to be around them. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't in the wrong for not being able to handle it. They have the right to say no. \n\nAlso, the author didn't tell Gregory about their long-term hopes, which might mean Gregory wasn't in a committed relationship with the author. So perhaps the author's expectations were unspoken. Gregory and Tammy starting a relationship after the author had broken up with him (or they were on-again, off-again) might not be the author's fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with a mix of emotions from losing their ex to their best friend, who they even suggested should connect. The refusal to be maid of honor is a personal choice to protect their emotional state, not an act of spite or being an asshole.\n"
