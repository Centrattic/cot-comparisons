Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because the friend is marrying her ex. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is close friends with Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They've been through a lot together. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-college boyfriend. Their relationship was on-again, off-again, and they're now both 27. The author didn't have any long-term expectations with Gregory but kept in touch. \n\nTammy moved to a city near Gregory and started interacting with his group. The author suggested Tammy reach out to Gregory for support. Later, Gregory stopped sending flirty texts, which might hint at his interest shifting. Tammy then reveals she's pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author is hurt and can't be part of the wedding, which makes Tammy sad.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the key points. The author has a genuine emotional response. She's hurt because her best friend is marrying someone she had a complicated relationship with. The author didn't know about their relationship until Tammy confessed. She's feeling betrayed or hurt, which is a valid emotional reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, Tammy is the one who initiated the relationship with Gregory, which the author wasn't aware of. The author had introduced Tammy to Gregory's circle, expecting him to help her socially. Now, Tammy is marrying her ex and having his child. The author's refusal to be the maid of honor is a personal choice based on her feelings. \n\nIs the author obligated to be the maid of honor? Typically, the maid of honor is a significant role, often given to a close friend or relative. The author is the best friend, but she's dealing with this emotional conflict. While it's a big role, the author's feelings are valid. She's not being cruel; she's just unable to participate due to the situation. \n\nTammy might feel hurt, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own emotional state. The key here is whether the author acted with malice or just genuine hurt. Since the author is being honest about her feelings and not forcing herself into a role she can't handle, it's more about her right to set boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that Gregory and Tammy are a better match, which adds to the complexity. The author isn't necessarily being selfish; she's acknowledging their compatibility but still feeling betrayed. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice based on her emotional response to a complicated situation. There's no indication she's being malicious or refusing without cause. The situation is understandable, and her decision is her own.\n"
