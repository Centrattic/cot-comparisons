Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding, given that the friend is marrying her ex-boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is close friends with Tammy, who is now marrying Gregory, the author's ex. Tammy got pregnant by Gregory, and they're getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be part of the wedding, even refusing the role of maid of honor.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is being unreasonable. Let's consider the dynamics. The author and Gregory had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship. Tammy and Gregory are now a couple, and Tammy is the best friend. The author feels hurt and is struggling with the situation.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the role? Well, the maid of honor is a significant role that requires emotional support and involvement. If the author is still upset and can't be present without resentment, it's understandable. But since Tammy asked her to be the maid of honor, the author might feel obligated. However, it's also important to consider the author's feelings here.\n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as not honoring their friendship because Tammy wanted her as the maid of honor. On the other hand, the author is dealing with personal hurt and may not be able to do the role properly if they can't be supportive. \n\nAnother angle: The author might have a right to prioritize their own emotional well-being. If they can't attend the wedding, that's a different issue, but the maid of honor role requires active participation. The author's refusal might be seen as avoiding a role they can't fulfill due to emotional reasons, which isn't necessarily being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, Tammy might not have considered the author's feelings when she got involved with Gregory. But the author's response is about their own capacity to be involved in the wedding. So, if the author can't do the role without causing more pain, they're not in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to not take on the role is based on their emotional state and inability to support the wedding, which is a valid reason. They aren't necessarily in the wrong, but they might need to communicate their feelings to Tammy to preserve the friendship. Answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
