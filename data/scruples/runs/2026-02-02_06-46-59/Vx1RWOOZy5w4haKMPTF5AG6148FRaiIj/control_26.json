Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding when the friend is marrying her ex. Hmm. \n\nFirst, the author is really close to Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They've been through a lot together. Then there's Gregory, her ex-boyfriend, whom she's had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship with. He moved away, they stayed in touch, but their relationship never worked out. \n\nNow, Tammy moved to a city near Gregory, and the author suggested she connect with Greg to meet his friends. That led to Tammy and Greg getting together and having a baby. The author found out that Tammy is pregnant with Greg's child and they're getting married. The author is hurt and doesn't want to be the maid of honor, even refusing to attend the wedding. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author is hurt, which is understandable. She's in a situation where her best friend is marrying someone she had a long-term relationship with. That's a lot of emotional baggage. Being the maid of honor is a significant role, requiring support and positivity. If the author can't be there for her friend because of the circumstances, maybe she's not being selfish but protecting her own feelings. \n\nBut wait, Tammy is her best friend and the one who asked her to be the maid of honor. The author is cutting off her friend during a major life event. That could be seen as hurtful. However, the author is also a human being with her own emotions. Can she be blamed for feeling this way? \n\nAlso, the author didn't know about the pregnancy and the marriage until after the fact. She tried to keep cool but couldn't. Maybe her reaction is valid. On the other hand, if Tammy wanted to have the wedding and be the maid of honor, the author might be supposed to support her, even if it's painful. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no. \n\nConsidering the situation, the author's refusal might be seen as understandable given the personal conflict. She's dealing with a best friend and an ex. The emotional impact is significant, and forcing herself to be the maid of honor might be more harmful to her. However, the author is cutting off her friend during a time when support is expected. But the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Her feelings are valid, and she has the right to protect her emotional well-being. The situation is complex, and her reaction is a result of being hurt, not necessarily wrong. So B.\n"
