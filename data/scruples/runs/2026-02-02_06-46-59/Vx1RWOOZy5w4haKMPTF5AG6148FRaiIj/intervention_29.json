Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Tammy, is getting married to the author's ex, Gregory, and she's pregnant. The author doesn't want to be the maid of honor and even refuses to go to their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's feelings. They've been best friends with Tammy for a long time, so this must be really painful. The author loved Gregory, and he's now with their best friend, which is a betrayal of trust on some level. The author might feel hurt, especially since Tammy and Gregory started dating without considering the author's feelings. The author's refusal to be part of the wedding could be a way of processing that hurt.\n\nBut then, Tammy is their best friend. Even though it's emotional, isn't there an expectation that a close friend would be there for them during a big event like a wedding? The author is cutting off Tammy, which could be seen as selfish. The author might think they're protecting themselves, but Tammy is likely also hurting, having to keep this secret or deal with the author's rejection.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they can't handle being around Tammy right now and don't want to be part of the wedding. But maybe they need time to heal and can't be in a position where they're forced to be happy for them. However, being the maid of honor is a big role, and the author might have committed to it before they found out about the pregnancy. If they had prior commitments, backing out could be a problem, but in this case, it seems like Tammy asked them specifically, not the other way around.\n\nAnother angle: Tammy approached the author with the news and the request. The author's immediate reaction is understandable, but is it fair to completely cut off a best friend? The author might need to take a step back, but not attending the wedding or being the maid of honor could be seen as abandoning Tammy during a significant moment. However, if the author is too emotionally overwhelmed, maybe it's better for them not to be involved.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Emotionally, no. But socially, being a maid of honor is a big deal. Maybe the author should try to reconcile their feelings with the friendship. But given the situation, it's a valid emotional response. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to be involved. Since they're acting out of hurt and not malicious intent, maybe they're not the asshole. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because it's their best friend's wedding. However, the author has the right to their feelings here. They're not being cruel; they're just overwhelmed.\n"
