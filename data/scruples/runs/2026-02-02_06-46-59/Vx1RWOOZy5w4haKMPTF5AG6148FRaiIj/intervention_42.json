Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor for her best friend who's marrying her ex. The writer is really hurt because her best friend is having a baby with her ex, who she had a complicated on-again-off-again relationship with since college. They were close, and the writer helped facilitate their meeting when the ex moved to a different city. Now, the friend is pregnant and getting married, and the writer is overwhelmed with emotions, leading her to decline being the maid of honor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The writer's feelings are definitely valid. She's heartbroken because the person she considered her sister is marrying someone she had a significant relationship with. The situation is a personal and emotional blow, so her reaction of being upset and needing space makes sense. People often have different coping mechanisms, and in this case, the writer isn't in a mental state to support them as they once did. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of the friendship. The friend did approach her about the wedding. The writer's refusal might come off as cutting off the friend entirely, which could be seen as a betrayal. However, the writer isn't cutting off the friend completely; she just needs space. The key here is whether the writer is in the wrong for prioritizing her own emotional well-being over fulfilling a role she's being asked to take.\n\nAnother angle is the ex's part in this. The writer had a long-term relationship with the ex, even if it was on-again-off-again. The fact that he started a relationship with her best friend might be a significant betrayal from the writer's perspective. Even though the friend was the one to approach the ex, the writer might feel that her trust was broken in some way, especially if she thought the ex was still a potential partner in the future.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions that they tried to break up for her sake but couldn't. So maybe there was some attempt to respect her feelings, but it didn't work out. The writer might feel like they went behind her back, even if they tried. That adds to the hurt.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, the maid of honor is a significant role. Refusing it could be seen as a major letdown. But given the circumstances, it's understandable if the writer isn't emotionally equipped to take on that role. The friend should have anticipated that this situation might cause the writer to feel conflicted, especially given the history with the ex. The writer's honesty about her feelings and her reasons for declining is a responsible move, even if it's hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the writer is not necessarily in the wrong. She's dealing with a complex mix of emotions and a situation that's deeply personal. Her decision to step back and protect her mental health is valid. While it's unfortunate for the friend who was looking forward to having her maid of honor, the writer's well-being is also important. The answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
