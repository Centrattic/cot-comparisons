Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a best friend to Tammy, her best friend since childhood. They've been through a lot together, including college and rooming together. Then there's Gregory, the author's ex-boyfriend. They had an on-again, off-again relationship for years, but never made it work. The author helped Tammy connect with Gregory because Tammy was lonely, and Tammy ended up getting pregnant with Gregory's child and they're getting married. The author is upset and doesn't want to be the maid of honor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. She was close friends with Tammy for a long time. Gregory was her ex, and she had a complicated relationship with him. She didn't know that Tammy was getting together with Gregory, and now she's hurt because the two people who are major parts of her life are getting married, especially with a baby involved. She's feeling betrayed, maybe even by both Tammy and Gregory. She's grieving the loss of her best friend's presence in her life now that Tammy is moving on with another relationship. She's also probably feeling some guilt or sadness over the fact that she helped connect them in the first place by suggesting Tammy reach out to Gregory. \n\nOn the other hand, Tammy and Gregory seem to be a good match. They might make a good family, and Tammy wanted the author to be her maid of honor, which is a significant role in the wedding. The author is refusing this role, which is a big deal because the maid of honor is a central position in the wedding. The question is whether the author is justified in her refusal or if she's being selfish.\n\nNow, thinking about the social norms and expectations here. Being the maid of honor is a role that's usually accepted out of friendship and support. If the author is refusing because she's hurt, is that a valid reason? Or is she being inconsiderate of Tammy's feelings? \n\nThe author is hurt because she was friends with Tammy and had a complicated relationship with Gregory. She might be feeling like she's being replaced or that her friendship with Tammy is being overshadowed by this new relationship. But at the same time, the author's feelings are real and valid. However, the maid of honor role is a big commitment and a symbol of support. If the author is not able to support Tammy through this, maybe it's not fair to Tammy to put her in that position. \n\nBut wait, the author is also dealing with her own emotional pain. She's upset that her best friend is with her ex, and the fact that they're having a baby adds another layer. The author might not be ready to be around them, which is understandable. But the question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to take on that role. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the key factors are intent and impact. The author is hurt, but she's making a decision that could impact Tammy's wedding. If the author is being honest about her feelings and not trying to be cruel, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's being selfish and not considering Tammy's feelings, maybe she is. \n\nAlso, the author was the one who suggested Tammy reach out to Gregory. Maybe she feels some responsibility for the situation, which could add to her guilt and pain. However, she wasn't the one who entered into a relationship with Gregory. \n\nI think the main point is whether the author is being reasonable in her refusal. If she's genuinely not able to support Tammy and Gregory at this time, then she might not be in the wrong. But if she's refusing out of spite or holding a grudge, then maybe she is. The text says she's devastated and questioning her actions, which suggests she's conflicted and not just being malicious. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's dealing with a lot of emotional pain, and her refusal is more about her inability to handle the situation right now rather than being a jerk. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
