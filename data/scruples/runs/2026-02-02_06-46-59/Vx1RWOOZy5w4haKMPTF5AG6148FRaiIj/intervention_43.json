Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because the friend is pregnant and marrying her ex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main characters are the author (let's call her A), her best friend Tammy, and her ex Gregory. They've all known each other for a long time. A and Gregory had a complicated on-again, off-again relationship. Tammy and Gregory started dating, which probably hurt A a lot, especially since they were close friends. Now Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child and wants A to be her maid of honor.\n\nThe key points here are the emotions involved and the expectations. A is clearly hurt and upset. She's been a best friend to Tammy for a long time, but now she's in a situation where her ex is marrying her best friend. The author is struggling with her feelings and doesn't want to be part of the wedding. Tammy wants her to be the maid of honor, which is a big role, and feels bad when the author refuses.\n\nNow, the question is whether A is in the wrong. Let's consider A's perspective. She's been in a relationship with Gregory, and then her best friend ends up with him. That's a tough situation. The author might feel betrayed or heartbroken. It's a personal matter, and relationships can be complex. If A is not ready to be in that role, maybe she's not wrong for saying no. On the other hand, Tammy is her best friend, and the author might feel she has a duty to support her even through the pain.\n\nBut, is it the author's responsibility to be the maid of honor? The maid of honor is a role that often comes with certain responsibilities and emotional support. If A is too hurt to do that, maybe she's being honest about her feelings. However, in some social circles, declining such a role might be seen as a betrayal, especially if Tammy is her best friend.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't ask for this situation. She wasn't the one who caused the breakup or the new relationship. She's a victim of circumstances here. If she's not ready to handle the emotional aspects of the wedding, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being. It's understandable that she needs space and time to process the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, Tammy might feel hurt that her best friend can't support her during this important time. But maybe Tammy should have considered the potential conflict of interests when she started dating Gregory. The author might not be the ideal choice for maid of honor given the situation, even if they were close friends.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to manage her own emotions and isn't in a place where she can support her friend in that role. It's a personal decision, and she's being honest about her feelings. The answer should be B (No).\n"
