Of course story is lot more complicated than title...\nSo two major parts of my life converged recently and I\u2019m just devastated and question pretty much all my actions, hence why I\u2019m posting here because I may be acting awful to two people I love dearly.\n\nSo part one is Tammy. My best friend since elementary school. She is literally my sister. We have done pretty much everything together, same college, same dorm, roommates, confidants, sloppy drunk mates, you name it. I love her so much.\n\nPart two is Gregory. My college boyfriend. I love him as well but we just could never make things work. Had one of those hot mess relationships which are a combination of torture and bliss. We have dated off and on since freshman orientation (all of us are 27 now) but usually end up in flames. I always loved him so much that I hoped we\u2019d mature and be able to make things work. He move to a different city after college but we\u2019d stay in touch, send flirty texts and even went on vacation twice. We got along great as long as we both had our own places to retreat to if that makes sense. All along we both had dating lives and to be fair I never told him about my long term idea that we\u2019d be together. \n\nA year ago Tammy moved to a city about 30 minutes away from Gregory. She was having a really hard time meeting people so I told her since she knew Gregory so well, she should call him and see if he can introduce her to his group of friends. She did and I knew she was much happier. About 3 months after that the flirty texts from Gregory just stopped out of the blue which isn\u2019t that big of a deal because it\u2019s happebed before but looking back I should have known what was coming. \n\nTammy just came home for the weekend and said she was making a special trip just to see me. Of course I was super excited to see her. She came over and she just seemed a little off. First she told me she was pregnant, after we got past the shock and established she was happy and keeping the baby I was elated to be an aunt. Then she said there\u2019s more and this is really hard. I about died when she said the baby is Gregory\u2019s. She apologized and said she was so sorry, they had just hit it off and they didn\u2019t mean to do anything to hurt me and they even tried breaking up for my sake but they just realized there was too much of an attraction and they started dating. She hadn\u2019t planned on getting pregnant but now that she is, they are getting married.  She said she hoped this didn\u2019t hurt me and she always dreamed about me being her maid of honor and there\u2019s no one else she\u2019s ever ask. \n\nI tried to keep my cool but I just lost it. I wasn\u2019t mad at her, just really really sad. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn\u2019t be around her right now and no way I could even go to thier wedding let alone be in the wedding party. She said she was sorry about a million times as she was leaving and she texted me quite a bit wanting to see me before she left town on Sunday. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I literally cried all weekend. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing...if I were necer in the picture...they make a perfect couple. Perfect. Tammy\u2019s brand of \u201cfirey\u201d is a Much better match to Gregory\u2019s calm nature than mine. They are both gorgeous and smart and great with kids. If two people should be hooking up to be great partners and parents, it\u2019s those two. I just can\u2019t help being hurt. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be her maid of honor?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to be the maid of honor at her best friend's wedding because the friend is marrying her ex. The person says they love both the friend and the ex, but they're hurt because the ex and best friend are now getting married with the friend pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships here. The author is best friends with Tammy, who's now marrying Gregory, the author's ex. The author is hurt because they had a long-term, on-again off-again relationship with Gregory. Tammy approached the author for help to meet people, which led her to Gregory. Now Tammy is pregnant with Gregory's child and wants the author to be her maid of honor. The author is upset and doesn't want to participate in the wedding, feeling it would be too painful.\n\nThe key points here are about whether the author is justified in their feelings. They love Tammy, but this situation is a double betrayal\u2014best friend with ex. But the author seems to understand that Tammy and Gregory are a good match. The author is not necessarily angry at Tammy but is hurt. They don't want to be the maid of honor, which is a significant role, and maybe not even attend the wedding. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Is it unreasonable to decline this role? Well, the author is going through emotional pain. Being the maid of honor is a big commitment and a symbolic role. If the author can't be there without being hurt, it's understandable. However, Tammy might feel rejected or hurt by the refusal. \n\nBut the author isn't being malicious; they're genuinely hurt. They tried to keep their cool but couldn't. They also didn't want to attend, which adds to the emotional impact. However, the author isn't forcing Tammy to do anything. They\u2019re just declining a role they can't handle. \n\nIt's important to note that the author wasn't in love with Gregory anymore by the time Tammy started seeing him. The relationships were on-again, off-again, and both had dating lives. So maybe the author isn't the wronged party here. Also, Tammy approached the author for help, which might have played a role in her meeting Gregory. But that's not entirely the author's fault. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being a maid of honor is a personal choice. If the author can't do it without being emotionally harmed, it's their right to decline. The author isn't acting out of spite but out of genuine hurt. So, they might not be in the wrong. However, they could be expected to attend the wedding as a friend, even if not as a maid of honor. But the story says they don't want to attend either, which could be more hurtful. But the question is specifically about being the maid of honor. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with legitimate emotional pain and it's their choice to prioritize their well-being.\n"
