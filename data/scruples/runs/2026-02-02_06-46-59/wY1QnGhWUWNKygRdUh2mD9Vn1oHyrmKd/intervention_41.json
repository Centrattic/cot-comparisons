I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. So I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old. That's a teenager, so maybe they're still learning about social expectations and family dynamics. The key points are about gift-giving during Christmas. The author won a $400 gift card and posted about it on Instagram. His sister saw it and told his mom, even though he asked her not to. The mom then insisted he use the gift card to buy gifts for the sister and later added cousins. The author ended up using the money for himself and got into an argument with his mom.\n\nNow, the author's argument is that his family was being \"greedy\" and he felt pressured, so he refused to buy gifts. But is he in the wrong? On one hand, in many cultures, giving gifts during Christmas is a social norm, especially within families. The author might have felt that the pressure to give was unreasonable, especially when the family members didn't ask for anything specific. The cousins are young and not seen often, so maybe the author felt it was unnecessary. However, he did agree initially to buy gifts for his mom and sister, then later changed his mind without informing them, leading to conflict.\n\nThe mom's actions could be seen as overstepping by not respecting the author's decision to keep the money. But there's also a traditional expectation that children, especially in some families, might be expected to share or give gifts. The author's frustration is understandable, but cutting off communication and not fulfilling the initial agreement might be seen as inconsiderate. However, since he's a minor, his financial independence is limited, and the situation might be more about family expectations vs. personal autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: The author used the gift card for himself, which is his money, but maybe the family expected a certain level of generosity. However, he was pressured by his mom, which could justify his reaction. The key is whether refusing to buy gifts is a valid response to the pressure. Some might say he's wrong for not following through on his initial agreement, while others might support his decision to protect his money from what he perceived as greed.\n\nConsidering all this, there's a balance. The author's actions are justified if the pressure was unreasonable, but there's also a cultural expectation to give gifts. Since the author is a teenager, there's a learning curve. The answer might depend on cultural context and family norms. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so the question is whether the answer should be A or B. Given the situation, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's using his money as he sees fit and the family's demands were excessive. So answer B.\n"
