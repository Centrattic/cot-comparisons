I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author winning a $400 Target gift card, sharing it on Instagram, and then their family finding out. The author's sister and mom then push them to buy gifts for multiple family members, leading to the author refusing and using the money for themselves instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 15 years old, which is a teenager, so their financial independence and understanding of money management might still be developing. The gift card was a personal prize, and the author initially intended to use it for themselves. However, after family members (especially the mother) pressured them to buy gifts, the author decided to withhold the gifts and spend the money on personal items. \n\nThe mother's actions here are important. She didn't ask politely but rather made demands, even adding more people (the cousins) after the initial request. The author felt this was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and not close contacts. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for their own financial boundaries, but it might also be viewed as being selfish or disrespectful in the context of family expectations.\n\nCultural considerations might play a role here. In some families, there's an expectation that any unexpected money should be shared, especially during holidays. However, the author's mother's approach was confrontational, which might have justified the author's frustration. The fact that the author was conservative with money and the mother's \"obnoxious\" behavior could be seen as a catalyst for the author's decision.\n\nAge is a factor too. At 15, the author is still under their parents' care, and there might be expectations of contributing to family traditions. However, the author's autonomy in managing their own money (even if it's a gift card) is a valid point. The mother's guilt-tripping and overstepping could have been the real issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to buy gifts for family members, especially when money is available, might be seen as inconsiderate. But the pressure from the mother to buy for cousins they don't see often adds another layer. The author's argument that the mother was \"greedy\" and overstepped by trying to control their money is a strong point in their defense.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the mother's behavior was arguably more at fault for the pressure and overreach, while the author was defending their own financial boundaries. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs after experiencing manipulation and excessive demands.\n"
