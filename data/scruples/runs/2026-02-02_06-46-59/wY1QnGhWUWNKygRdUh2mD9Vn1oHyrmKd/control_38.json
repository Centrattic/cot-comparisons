I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old, which is important. At that age, people might have less experience with social norms and family expectations. The author received a $400 gift card, which they won in a drawing. They posted about it on Instagram, and their sister found out. The sister then called the author, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom still found out, probably through the sister. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister and herself, and later added the cousins. The author felt this was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and they don't see them often. The author decided not to buy the gifts, spent the money on themselves and a friend, and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, in many cultures, giving gifts to close family during Christmas is a common tradition. The author might feel obligated to participate. However, the author was given a gift card with the intention to use it for themselves, and they were pressured by the mom to share it without prior agreement. The mom's reaction might have been overbearing, leading the author to feel that their money was being taken. The author is being conservative with money, which is a reasonable trait, especially if they're young and learning financial responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations versus the reality. The author didn't agree to share the gift card money, and the mom's insistence might have been disrespectful of the author's autonomy. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending could be seen as a defense of their personal finances, especially if the family's demands were unreasonable. However, the social expectation to give gifts to family might weigh on the other side.\n\nBut considering the context, the author was clear they didn't want the mom to know initially, and the mom's reaction was \"obnoxious.\" The author might not have a duty to share a gift they received, even if it's a surprise. The cousins being 6 and 2 might not require expensive gifts. The author's decision to use the money for personal needs and a friend isn't inherently wrong, especially if the family's demands were unreasonably high. The argument with the mom is a family conflict, but the author's actions seem more about self-preservation of their money rather than being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, in this case, the author might not be in the wrong because they had the right to decide how to use their gift card, especially if the family's demands were excessive and the author was pressured without their consent. The mom's behavior might have pushed the author to set boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
