I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 gift card, which they won and initially didn't plan to share. The mother and sister found out, and the mother extended the list to include cousins. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to conflict with the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, so their perspective and financial habits might still be developing. The gift card was won by the author, so they might see it as their own money. The mother's insistence on buying gifts for the family, especially after finding out, could be seen as overstepping. The author mentions feeling that the family was being greedy and pressuring them, which led to their decision to not buy gifts for them.\n\nOn the other hand, family traditions around gift-giving might play a role. In many cultures, giving gifts is a way to show love and appreciation, even for relatives one doesn't see often. The author's refusal might be perceived as inconsiderate, especially if the family's expectations were unspoken but commonly understood. However, the author's frustration is valid if they felt their autonomy over the money was being violated, and the mother's behavior might have escalated the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the age factor. At 15, the author is still learning financial responsibility and social norms. They might not have had the experience to navigate such a situation gracefully. The mother's actions\u2014like taking the gift card and adding cousins to the list\u2014could be seen as pressuring the child, which might justify the author's reaction. But the author's choice to completely cut off the family from the gift-giving could also be seen as immature or selfish, depending on the family dynamics.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have discussed their budget constraints with the family or set boundaries. However, in this case, the author felt so pressured that they decided to spend the money on themselves, which might be their way of standing up for themselves. The key points are the author's feelings of being pressured, the mother's overstepping, and the cultural expectations of gift-giving.\n\nIn summary, while refusing to buy gifts for family could be seen as inconsiderate, the context of pressure and the mother's behavior might mitigate the author's responsibility. The age of 15 is also a factor in understanding the author's perspective and the situation.\n"
