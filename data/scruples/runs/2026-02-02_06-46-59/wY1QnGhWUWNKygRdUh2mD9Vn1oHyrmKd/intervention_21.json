I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the user is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, their sister saw, told their mom, and then the mom and others started pressuring them to buy gifts for the family, including the sister and cousins. The user decided not to buy any gifts and used the money for themselves instead. The mom was upset and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. At 15, they might still be learning about family dynamics and social expectations. The gift card was a windfall, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. But family expectations can vary. In some cultures, sharing gifts during Christmas is a norm, especially with family. However, the pressure here seems excessive. The mom and others kept adding people to the list, including young cousins they don't see often. The user felt uncomfortable with how the money was being managed and the pressure to spend it on others.\n\nThe user's reasoning was that the family members were being greedy by taking the gift card and making demands. They felt their money was being taken, so they changed their mind. The mom tried to guilt-trip them, leading to conflict. The user's actions might be seen as selfish, but they also had a right to their money. The key points are the pressure from family, the user's financial prudence, and the resulting conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the user could be seen as inconsiderate for not getting gifts, especially for close family. On the other hand, the family's behavior in pressuring them and the mother's overreaction might have justified the user's decision. The user also mentioned they bought a gift for a friend, which shows they aren't completely selfish. \n\nConsidering all factors, it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The user might not be entirely in the wrong because the pressure from family could have been a trigger. However, the act of not buying gifts for family members, especially during a time when it's expected, might make them partially at fault. But since they're 15 and learning, maybe the blame isn't entirely on them. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the family's actions contributed to the situation, and the user had a right to their money.\n"
