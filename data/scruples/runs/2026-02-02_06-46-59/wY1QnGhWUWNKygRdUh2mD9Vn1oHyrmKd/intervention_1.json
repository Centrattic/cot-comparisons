I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is 15 and got a $400 gift card. They initially planned to buy gifts for their family but then changed their mind after their mom and sister kept pressuring them. The parents and sister started asking for more people to get gifts for after the initial plan. The author felt it was too much and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the parents' perspective. They might feel that it's a family tradition to exchange gifts, and since the author won the gift card, they expected it to be used for family members. The author's mom might have felt that it's their responsibility to provide for the family, especially during the holidays. However, the author did try to buy gifts initially but was pressured into buying for more people.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a teenager with their own money. They might not feel obligated to spend it on family members, especially if it's not a regular occurrence. The parents' approach was a bit controlling, as they kept adding more people without considering the author's financial comfort. The author's reaction, while maybe harsh, was a response to that pressure.\n\nI think the author did have the right to decide how to use their own money. The problem was that the family members kept increasing the expectations without respecting the author's boundaries. The author's main fault might be reacting with anger instead of calmly explaining their stance. However, since they were a teenager and the parents were overstepping, the blame isn't entirely on them. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
