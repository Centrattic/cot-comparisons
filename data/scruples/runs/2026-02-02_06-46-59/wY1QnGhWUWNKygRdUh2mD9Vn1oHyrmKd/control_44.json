I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Christmas gifts and family expectations. The author is 15 years old, which is a minor, but they have a bit of spending money now from a $400 Target gift card. \n\nFirst, the author won the gift card and shared it on Instagram, which probably brought attention to it. The sister found out and told the mom, even though the author told her not to. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister and then later added cousins. The author felt this pressure was unfair, especially since the cousins are young and not frequently seen. They ended up spending the money on themselves and a friend instead, leading to a conflict with the mom.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, in many families, there's an expectation that if you have money, you might share or give gifts, especially around holidays. But the author is a teenager, and financial responsibility is a personal choice. The mom's approach of adding more people after the initial request might be seen as manipulative or greedy, especially asking for thoughtful, non-cheap gifts for cousins the author doesn't see often. The author's reaction could be justified if they felt coerced into spending beyond their comfort level.\n\nHowever, the act of refusing to buy gifts for family members when the money is their own is a gray area. On one hand, it's their money, and they're allowed to spend it how they want. On the other hand, family might feel slighted if there's an unspoken expectation to give gifts. The author's mom did escalate the pressure by calling and adding more people, which might have been a contributing factor. \n\nThe key points are the pressure from the mom and the author's right to decide how to spend their own money. The author's age might influence the situation, as teenagers are still learning about social expectations and family dynamics. The mom's guilt-tripping and the author's frustration could both be seen as valid in their own contexts. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't take the pressure well and refused, which led to conflict, but the mom's initial overstepping by adding more people without consent might be the root issue. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending is understandable, especially if they felt the pressure was unreasonable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
