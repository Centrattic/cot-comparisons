I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 15-year-old who won a $400 Target gift card and then got pressured by their mom and sister to buy gifts for family members. The author initially agreed to get gifts for their mom and sister, but then the mom added two cousins, which the author found unreasonable. The author decided not to buy the gifts and spent the money on themselves instead. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the gift card was a personal win, so the author has the right to decide how to use it. The mom and sister, especially the mom, were quite pushy, adding more people to the list after the initial agreement. The cousins are young and not frequent contacts, so the necessity of spending more on them might be questionable. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for their own needs, which is understandable, especially if they're being taught to be conservative with money. \n\nThe mom's reaction was harsh, leading to an argument. The author standing up for their decision might be seen as assertive, especially at 15. However, in some family dynamics, expecting to give gifts is part of the tradition, especially with family members. But the mom's approach of adding more people after the fact and being obnoxious could be a key factor. The author might have overstepped by not buying gifts for family members, but if the pressure was undue, maybe not. \n\nConsidering the author's age, 15, they might not have a lot of financial independence yet, but the gift card was a personal win. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs, especially after the mom's behavior, could be seen as justified. However, refusing to buy gifts for family might be seen as inconsiderate. But given the mom's actions, the author might feel it's a matter of standing up against pressure. \n\nI think the key points are the initial agreement, the mom's addition without consent, the author's right to their own money, and the family's expectations. The author's decision could be seen as reasonable, especially if the pressure was excessive. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
