I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the 15-year-old is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for family members after they found out about his $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, the situation: He won the gift card, posted about it, sister saw it. Then his mom and sister started pressuring him to buy gifts for them and even extended to cousins. He felt it was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and he doesn't see them often. He decided to keep the money for himself and got stuff for a friend instead. His mom was upset and guilt-tripped him, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, gift-giving is a common part of Christmas, and the family might expect it. The mom did ask, even if a bit pushy. He had the means to buy gifts, so refusing could be seen as selfish. Also, as a teenager, he might be learning about responsibility and sharing. However, he was 15, which is young, and his perspective on money and autonomy might be different. He was clear about his conservative spending. The family's pressure might have been a trigger for him to take a stand.\n\nOn the other hand, he was pressured into sharing a gift he received, and the family's approach (especially the mom's behavior) was overbearing. He was within his rights to use the gift card however he wanted, especially since he's a minor but responsible for his own spending. The fact that he got a gift for a friend and himself might be seen as appropriate use of his money. The problem was the family's reaction and their initial pressure, which might have been unreasonable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at the pressure and the mom's behavior, maybe the fault isn't entirely his. But in terms of social expectations, not giving gifts when others expect it could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the context, maybe he's justified in his decision. The key factors are the family's overstepping and his right to decide how to use his gift. Since he's a teenager, the family might have different expectations, but his reaction to the pressure could be seen as a reasonable boundary. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
