I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family after receiving a $400 gift card. The author is 15 years old, which is important context.\n\nFirst, the gift card was a windfall, and the author initially planned to use part of it for family. But after their mother and sister intervened, adding more family members (cousins) and pressuring the author, they changed their mind. The author felt the pressure was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and not seen often. They decided to spend the money on themselves instead, which upset their mom.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author, 15 is still a minor, and financial responsibilities might not be as expected as they would be for an adult. The mother's behavior\u2014being pushy and adding more people\u2014could be seen as unreasonable. However, in many cultures, there's an expectation to share gifts, especially within family, even if it's not a strict rule. The author might feel they have the right to their own money, especially a gift they received. \n\nBut the key points here are consent and pressure. The mother didn't ask for permission to expand the gift list. The author's frustration with being pressured and having their privacy invaded (like the mom taking the gift card) might justify their decision. However, the author did initially agree to buy gifts before the pressure increased. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did make a commitment and then reneged because of the pressure. But considering the age and the fact that the money is their own, maybe they're not obligated to follow through with the initial plan if they feel the pressure is unwarranted. \n\nThe author's reasoning about the cousins being young and not seen often could be a valid point. Spending on oneself when the money is earned or gifted is a personal choice. The mother's reaction might be harsh, but the author's decision could be seen as standing up for their own financial autonomy.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They had the right to decide how to use their money, especially after feeling pressured. However, maybe they could have communicated better, like explaining their decision before spending all the money. But given the circumstances and their age, it's a bit of a gray area. The pressure from family might have contributed to the author's change of heart.\n"
