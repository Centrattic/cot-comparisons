I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not buying their family members Christmas gifts. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author received a $400 gift card, which they won. They bragged about it on Instagram, and their sister saw it. The author's mom then got involved and made them feel pressured to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, etc. The author felt this was obnoxious and decided not to spend the money on family, instead spending it on themselves. The mom was upset and there was an argument.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is 15, which is a teenager, still young. They were given a gift card they won, which is their money. They were pressured by their mom to buy gifts for family members, including cousins they don't see often. The author felt this was unreasonable and decided not to comply. The mom reacted negatively, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author was not obligated to spend their own money on family. The mom and family members didn't contribute to the gift card, so the author has the right to use it as they see fit. The pressure from the mom to buy gifts for others, especially for people the author doesn't see often, could be seen as pushing their own expectations onto the child's funds. The author might have a valid point about autonomy over their money. However, in some family dynamics, there might be an unspoken expectation to share or buy gifts during the holidays. But the mom's approach seems to have been overbearing, especially after the initial refusal. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending after feeling pressured could be justified. The age of the author (15) is also a factor; they might be developing their independence.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more tactfully. They could have explained their decision earlier, perhaps before using the money, to avoid the last-minute conflict. But the situation involved the mom taking the gift card and then adding more people to the list, which might have pushed the author's buttons. The mom's reaction, including guilt-tripping and yelling, isn't helpful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to their own money and the stress from the family's demands. The mom's actions were probably more at fault here. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
