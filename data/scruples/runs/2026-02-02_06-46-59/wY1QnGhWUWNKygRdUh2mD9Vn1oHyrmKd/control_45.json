I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to buy family Christmas gifts after getting a $400 gift card. The author is 15, so that's a teenager. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author won a gift card and told their sister, then their mom found out and insisted they buy gifts for the family. The author initially agreed but then changed their mind and used the money for themselves. The mom was upset, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author felt pressured by their mom and sister to use the gift card for gifts. They ended up not getting gifts for the family and instead spent the money on themselves. The mom was upset because she expected the gifts.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms around gift-giving during Christmas, it's common to exchange gifts among family. However, the author is a teenager, so their perspective might be different. The author is 15, which is still a minor, so maybe there's an expectation of contributing to family traditions. But the author felt the pressure was too much and the mom was being greedy.\n\nThe author's argument is that the family members (cousins are 6 and 2) are not close, so spending a lot on them isn't necessary. Also, the mom's behavior\u2014bursting into the room, being obnoxious, and adding more people to the list\u2014might have been overwhelming. The author decided to prioritize their own spending, which led to conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a family obligation standpoint, maybe. But from a personal autonomy perspective, the author is asserting control over their own money. The gift card was won by the author, so they have the right to spend it as they see fit. However, the initial agreement to buy gifts might have been a social expectation or a promise, which the author broke. \n\nBut the mom's actions\u2014interfering, adding more people, being pushy\u2014could have contributed to the author's frustration. The author's response of cutting off communication and not getting gifts might be seen as rude, but the underlying pressure might justify their actions. \n\nAt 15, the author is still developing financial responsibility and social norms understanding. The mom might have a right to be upset if there was an expectation of contributing to family traditions, but the author's decision to spend on themselves isn't necessarily unethical. It's more about differing expectations and communication breakdown.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author did break a social expectation, but the mom's behavior might have pushed them to that point. The answer might depend on cultural standards and the specific family dynamics. However, since the author is a minor, there might be an expectation that they follow family traditions, but they also have the right to manage their own money. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to their money, and the mom's approach was overbearing. The author's decision, while possibly impolite, is a valid choice given the circumstances.\n"
