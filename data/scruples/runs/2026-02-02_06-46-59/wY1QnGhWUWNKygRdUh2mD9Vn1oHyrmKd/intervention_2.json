I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after getting a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author received a gift card and posted about it. The sister found out and told the mom. The mom then pushed the author to buy gifts for multiple family members. The author initially agreed but then decided not to after feeling pressured and bought things for themselves instead. The mom was upset and there was an argument.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that their money is their own, especially since they were given a gift card. They might not feel obligated to share, especially if they have a conservative approach to money. The pressure from the mom and the sudden expansion of the list from mom and sister to cousins could be seen as excessive. The author is 15, which is a minor, but even so, the expectation to share might be there. However, there's also the aspect of family dynamics and expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that since the author received the gift card, they should share with family, especially since the author was the one who initially agreed. The sudden change of heart after the mom added cousins might have crossed a line, but the author's reaction of cutting off communication and buying for themselves could be seen as selfish, especially given the age.\n\nBut considering the author's age, 15, their financial independence might be limited, and their perspective on ownership might be stronger. The mom's behavior\u2014bursting into the room, making demands, and then being upset when the author changes their mind\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author's right to decide how to spend their own money, even if it's a gift, could be a valid point. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family expectations during Christmas. In many cultures, exchanging gifts is a norm, and the author's refusal might be seen as going against that. But the author wasn't obligated to buy gifts in the first place unless there was a prior agreement. The fact that the mom kept adding more people after the initial agreement might have made the author feel pressured, leading to their decision to stop. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author might be within their rights to spend the money as they wish, especially since they were pressured and the gift card was their own. However, the way they handled it\u2014ignoring calls and being confrontational\u2014might not be the best approach. But in terms of the ethical question of whether they're in the wrong, the answer could be no because they're not legally or morally obligated to buy gifts for others. The family's expectations versus the individual's autonomy is a common AITA theme, and often the person is not in the wrong if their actions don't harm others beyond personal expectations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
