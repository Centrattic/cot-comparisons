I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts using a $400 gift card they won. \n\nFirst, the author received a gift card and shared it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and then their mom got involved, adding more people to the list. The author felt pressured and decided to stop buying gifts, using the money for themselves instead. They faced backlash from their mom.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the author (15), the pressure they felt, and the fact that the gift card was their own. At 15, they're a teenager, and while they might be learning about responsibility, their financial independence is still developing. The family members, particularly the mom, seemed to take it as an obligation, adding more people after the initial request, which might have been overwhelming. \n\nThe author's main issue is the pressure from family. They were told they \"have to\" get gifts, which could feel like an entitlement. The mom's reaction after the author refused could indicate poor communication. However, the author did agree initially but changed their mind, which could be seen as a lack of follow-through.\n\nBut considering the context: the author is a minor, the money was their own, and the family's demands were excessive, especially for distant relatives like cousins. The author's decision to use the money for personal needs (like a laptop for work) might be justified, especially if they're struggling financially. The mom's reaction being obnoxious suggests she overstepped, contributing to the author's frustration.\n\nSo, while the author did agree at first, the pressure and lack of respect for their autonomy might mean they weren't necessarily in the wrong. The family's behavior, particularly the mom's, played a role. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had the right to decide how to use their money, especially given the circumstances.\n"
