I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 15-year-old who refused to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The author initially agreed to buy gifts for mom and sister, but then mom added cousins, which the author found unreasonable. The author ended up spending the money on themselves and a friend, and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is a teenager, which might affect their maturity and financial responsibility. They were given a gift card, which is a gift, so maybe they feel it's their money to spend as they like. The family members (mom and sister) found out about the gift card, and the mom kept adding more people who needed gifts. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money instead.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From one angle, the author was initially willing to buy gifts but then changed their mind when the number of people increased. The mom might see this as not fulfilling the expectation of giving gifts to family, especially during a holiday. However, the author felt that the mom and family were being greedy and using their private information to pressure them. The author is using their own money (the gift card) and might not see it as their responsibility to buy gifts for cousins they don't see often. \n\nAlso, the age of the author (15) is a factor. At that age, they might not have a strong financial understanding or the same expectations as adults. They might prioritize their own desires, especially after feeling pressured. The mom's reaction could be seen as overstepping by not respecting the author's decision to keep the money, given that it was a personal gift.\n\nOn the other hand, in some cultures or families, giving gifts to close family, even once a year, is expected. The author might be seen as being selfish by not contributing, especially since they had the means. However, the way the family handled the situation\u2014mom suddenly adding more people and the author feeling coerced\u2014might justify their decision to back out.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a bit of a gray area. But the key here is the pressure from family members and the author's right to spend their own money. Since the gift card was a personal gift, the author isn't legally obligated to use it for family gifts. The conflict arose from family expectations vs. personal choice. Given the context, the author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to what they perceived as being taken advantage of.\n"
