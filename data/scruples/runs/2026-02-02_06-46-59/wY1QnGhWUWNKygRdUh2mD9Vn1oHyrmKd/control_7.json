I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Christmas gifts and money. The author is 15 years old, which might be important because they're a teenager, maybe not in a position to spend money as they wish yet.\n\nThe author won a $400 gift card and posted about it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and told the mom, even though the author had told the sister not to. Then the mom insisted that the author should buy gifts for the sister, the author's mom, and two cousins. The author felt pressured and ended up not buying gifts for the family but bought things for themselves and a friend. The mom got upset, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author's parents might have expectations that children should share or give gifts to family members during Christmas. The author's mom was being pushy, adding more people to the list even though the cousins are young and not seen often. The author is being conservative with their money, which is understandable, especially if they're still a minor. However, depending on the family dynamics, parents might expect their kids to participate in gift-giving as a family tradition.\n\nThe author did tell the mom not to tell others about the gift card but the sister did, leading to the mom getting involved. The author might feel that the mom overstepped by demanding gifts. The mom's reaction could be seen as overbearing, especially adding cousins to the list. However, the author could have communicated their discomfort earlier instead of snapping after the fact.\n\nThe author is 15, so maybe they're not in a position to manage such a large amount of money yet, and parents might have a right to guide them. But they're also at an age where they might want more independence. The argument could be about boundaries and respect. The mom might feel entitled to the gift card money since it's in a family setting, but the author might see it as their own.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it depends on perspective. The author might be wrong in not considering family expectations, but the mom is wrong in being pushy and adding unexpected recipients. The author's decision to buy themselves stuff instead could be seen as selfish, but their frustration is understandable given the pressure. The key issue is the lack of prior communication. The author could have discussed their limits with the mom before making decisions. However, the mom's demands were also excessive. So, maybe both have some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nConsidering the options, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the mom was overstepping, and the author has a right to manage their own money. However, the author could have handled it more gracefully. But given the context, the author's actions are justified. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes, in the wrong) because ignoring the mom's requests and not buying gifts could hurt family feelings. But the mom's behavior was also problematic. Given the scenario, the author's stance might be more about standing up for personal boundaries, so B might be the answer.\n"
