I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the 15-year-old got a $400 gift card, told their sister, but then the mom found out and pressured him to buy gifts for the whole family, including cousins. The author refused and used the money on themselves, leading to a conflict with the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the person. At 15, they might not have a lot of autonomy, and family dynamics can be tricky. The parents might expect that if a child gets a gift card, they should use part of it for family gifts. But the author was specific that they didn't want to share the gift card, especially after the mom overstepped by bursting into their room. \n\nThe mom's behavior seems overbearing. She didn't respect the author's initial request to keep it private and then added more people to the list. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves, which is understandable if they're being forced into an uncomfortable situation. \n\nAlso, the cousins are young, and the author might not see them often, so spending a lot on them isn't necessary. The author's main issue was the mom's greedy approach and lack of respect for their money. The mom's reaction of guilt-tripping and yelling is problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They were given money as a gift, but it's their choice how to spend it. The mom's pressure turned it into an obligation, which the author rightly rejected. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to decide how to use their money and were reacting to the mom's overreach.\n"
