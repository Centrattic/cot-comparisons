I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 gift card and told their sister not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway. The mom then told the author they had to get gifts for the author's sister, mom, and two cousins. The author felt pressured and ended up spending the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset because they didn't buy gifts for everyone.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author was given money (the gift card) and the mom expected them to use it for family gifts. The author might feel it's their money to spend as they wish, especially since they're 15. But the mom might see it as a shared family resource, especially since she found out and felt entitled to those gifts. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from the mom and sister being \"obnoxious\" and pushing for gifts, which made them change their mind. The author's reaction of ignoring calls and texts, then buying themselves stuff, seems like a response to feeling pressured. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have communicated better. Instead of just refusing and not explaining, maybe they could have discussed their budget or limits with the family. But given the age, maybe they're still learning about these dynamics. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's actions led to conflict, but the family's insistence on using the gift card for others might have crossed a line. The author's response might be seen as self-advocacy, but the method could be questioned. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have the right to their money, but maybe they could have handled it more diplomatically. However, the mom's behavior in pressuring them might be just as problematic. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the context, the answer might be B (No), because the author's decision to use their own money as they see fit isn't inherently wrong, even if it caused conflict.\n"
