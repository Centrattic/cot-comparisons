I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for their family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The situation involves the mother and sister discovering the gift card, adding more people to the gift list without the author's consent, and the author deciding to spend the money on themselves instead.\n\nFirst, the author is only 15 years old. At that age, teenagers often have different perspectives on money and obligations. The gift card was a windfall they won, so they technically have the right to spend it as they see fit. However, family expectations around gifts can be a cultural or family norm, which might play a role here.\n\nThe mother and sister's reactions are important. The mother added cousins to the list without asking, which the author found obnoxious. The author felt pressured and decided to stop giving gifts after the mother's pushy behavior. The key point here is the pressure exerted by the family members. If the author wasn't obligated to share the gift card money, then the family's demands could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nThe author's decision to spend the money on themselves, including a friend, might be seen as justified if they felt their autonomy was being violated. However, the argument could be made that refusing to give family gifts could be seen as selfish, especially in a family context where gift-giving is expected. But considering the circumstances\u2014being a teenager, the sudden addition of more people, and the family's overreach\u2014it might be more about the family's expectations being too much.\n\nThe final argument the author made about the family being greedy and overstepping could be a valid reaction. The author's right to their own money and their feelings about being pressured are significant factors. Since the gift card was a personal prize, the author isn't obligated to share unless they choose to. The mother's guilt-tripping after the fact doesn't help, as it adds to the conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to decide how to use their own money, especially after feeling coerced into giving more than they were comfortable with. The family's behavior might be more at fault here for pushing their expectations. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
