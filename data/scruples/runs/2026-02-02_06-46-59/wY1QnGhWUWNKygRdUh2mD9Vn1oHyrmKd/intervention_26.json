I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card and told his sister not to mention it to their mom. But his mom found out anyway and started demanding gifts for various family members, including his sister and cousins. The author felt pressured and ended up spending the money on himself instead. His mom got upset, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the age factor: the author is 15. At that age, teenagers are developing their independence and financial habits. The mom's behavior seems to cross a line by being \"obnoxious\" and pressuring the son to spend his money. The mom even called him after he started shopping to add more people, which might be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe author's reaction of refusing to buy gifts because he felt his privacy was invaded and his money was being taken isn't entirely unreasonable. However, not giving gifts to family members might be seen as selfish, especially if there's an expectation of gift-giving during Christmas. But the key here is the context of how the mom handled the situation. She pushed for more gifts after he already had plans, and the author felt his autonomy was violated.\n\nI think the situation is a bit nuanced. If the author had explained his decision calmly without the outburst, maybe the outcome would be different. But the mom's actions were likely contributing to the conflict. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the mom was being greedy and invasive. So, the answer is B.\n"
