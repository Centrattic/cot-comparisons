I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation is that the author won a $400 gift card, told their sister, who then called the author. The sister talked to the mom, who then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister, mom, and two cousins. The author felt the pressure was too much, especially since the cousins are young and not close, so they decided not to buy anything for family and spent the money on themselves instead. The mom got upset and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the person. The author is 15, so maybe they're still learning about social norms and family expectations. At that age, financial independence and personal spending choices might be a new concept. They might not have a lot of money, so $400 is a significant amount. \n\nThe mom's reaction is part of the issue here. She seemed to take the gift card and then dictated how it should be spent. The author felt their autonomy was invaded when the mom and sister took the gift card and added more people. The cousins are 6 and 2, so maybe the author doesn't have a close relationship with them, making the purchase feel unnecessary. \n\nFamily expectations can vary. Some families might expect you to share in certain ways, but others might be more individualistic. The author's frustration comes from being pressured to spend money on people they don't see often, especially after the mom's obnoxious comments. \n\nThe key points are the pressure from family to spend money on others versus personal choice. The author might be in the right for asserting their right to spend their own money as they see fit, especially if the family was overstepping. However, the author could also be seen as being selfish or not considering family traditions. \n\nBut considering the mom's behavior\u2014taking the gift card and adding more people without respecting the author's financial boundaries\u2014maybe the author is justified in their decision. The age factor also plays a role; at 15, they might be developing a sense of personal responsibility and boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They are standing up for their autonomy, even if the family didn't like it. The parents might have overstepped, so the author's choice to not comply is reasonable. Answer B.\n"
