I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author received a $400 gift card and shared it on Instagram. Their sister saw it and told the mom, despite the author asking her not to. The mom then demanded gifts for the author's sister and herself. Then, the mom added more people\u2014cousins\u2014during a phone call. The author refused, bought themselves stuff instead, and got into an argument. The author is 15, so that's a key point.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author was wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might disagree. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is a minor, 15 years old. Legally, they're not adults, and their financial decisions might be influenced by family dynamics. The mom might feel it's expected to share, but the author has the right to their own money. The mom did add more people unexpectedly, which could be seen as pressuring the author. The author's reaction\u2014buying themselves stuff\u2014might be seen as self-protective, especially after the initial overstepping by the mom and sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might argue that there's a family expectation to give gifts, and the author's refusal could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the mom's insistence and the sudden expansion of the list. The mom's actions\u2014bursting into the room, making demands\u2014could be contributing to the conflict.\n\nThe key here is the author's age. At 15, they're still learning about money management and social expectations. The mom's behavior might be overreaching, especially adding more people after the initial request. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending after feeling pressured could be seen as a legitimate response. However, refusing to give any gifts might hurt family feelings, which is a point against the author.\n\nBut considering the mom's role in escalating the situation by adding more people without prior notice and the author's right to control their own money, it might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The author's explanation about the cousins being young and not seen often also makes sense. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the pressure from family was a factor, and the author had the right to decide how to use their money.\n"
