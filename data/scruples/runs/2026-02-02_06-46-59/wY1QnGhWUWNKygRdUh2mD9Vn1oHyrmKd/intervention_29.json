I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after someone else found out about their gift card. The author is 15, which is pretty young, but they are dealing with family dynamics and money.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 gift card, which they didn't plan to share. Their sister found out through Instagram, and then the mom got involved. The author initially agreed to buy gifts for mom and sister but then the mom added cousins, which the author felt was unreasonable. The author then changed their mind and used the money on themselves, leading to a conflict with the mom.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The gift card was won by the author, so technically, it's their money to spend as they like. The mom and sister, though, expected them to share, which might be a common family expectation. However, the mom added more people (the young cousins) without considering the author's perspective. The author might feel pressured and resentful, especially since the cousins are young and not close. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author did initially agree to buy gifts for mom and sister, then changed their mind after the mom added more people. That could be seen as breaking a promise. However, the mom's approach was pushy, which might have influenced the author's decision. The author's age is also a factor; at 15, they're still learning about personal boundaries and financial responsibility. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their own money, especially when they're being pressured? Family expectations can vary, but the author's reaction might be a result of feeling manipulated. However, refusing to buy gifts entirely without communication might come off as abrupt. \n\nIn the end, the author's reasoning is that the family was being greedy and pushy. The mom's guilt-tripping could have been a factor. The author's decision to keep the money private might be valid for their own financial autonomy. But there's a line between standing up for oneself and being inconsiderate. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms, but generally, the author is not in the wrong if they're asserting their right to manage their own money without undue pressure. However, the way they handled the refusal (hanging up, ignoring calls) might be seen as rude. But considering their age and the circumstances, it's a complex situation. So, I think the answer could be B (No), as the author isn't inherently wrong for not buying gifts after the pushy behavior from family.\n"
