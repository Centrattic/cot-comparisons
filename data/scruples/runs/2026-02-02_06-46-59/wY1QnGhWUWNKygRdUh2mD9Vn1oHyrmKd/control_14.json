I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Christmas gifts and family expectations. The user is 15, which is pretty young, and they got a $400 gift card. They initially planned to get gifts for their mom and sister but then the mom added more cousins. The user decided not to buy anything else and kept the money for themselves, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the user received the gift card, which they were allowed to use as they wanted. The mom and sister might have expected them to share, but the user is 15 and managing their own money. The mom kept adding people to the list after the user had already agreed to buy for the first two, which could be seen as pressure. The user felt it was unfair to buy for cousins they don't see often, so they decided to stop and use the money on themselves and a friend. \n\nThe key points here are the user's age, their right to their own money, and the family's expectations. The user might be in their right to decide how to spend their money, especially if they weren't obligated to buy gifts for everyone. The mom's actions of bursting in and pressuring more could be the issue here. However, the user did initially agree to buy for mom and sister, then changed their mind after the mom added more names. But since they had the right to their own money, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, family expectations might play a role. Gifts are often a part of holiday traditions, and the user's refusal could be seen as disrespectful. But the user's stance is about being conservative with money and the pressure from the mom. The user's age might also mean they're still learning about personal finances and family dynamics. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might not be in the wrong. They had the right to their money and the family's expectations might be too much. The mom's behavior of pressuring and using guilt could be the main issue here. So the answer would be B.\n"
