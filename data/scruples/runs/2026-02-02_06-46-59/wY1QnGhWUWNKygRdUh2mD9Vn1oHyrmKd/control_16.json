I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family after receiving a gift card.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person got a $400 Target gift card, which they initially didn't want to share. Their sister found out, and the mom insisted they use it to buy gifts for the sister and then later for cousins. The author felt pressured and ended up using the money for themselves instead. The mom was upset and tried to guilt-trip them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that the money was a gift they won, so they had the right to spend it as they wished. The mother's insistence could have felt controlling, and the author is a teenager learning to manage their finances independently. The mom's reaction might be seen as overstepping, especially since the author had already agreed to buy gifts but then felt pressured further.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that sharing is part of the holiday spirit, especially within a family. The mother could be seen as trying to ensure everyone gets a gift, and the author's refusal might come off as selfish. However, the author was clear about being conservative with money, which is a valid personal choice.\n\nAge is a factor here. The author is 15, so they might still be learning about financial responsibility and social expectations. The mother's approach of pressuring and guilt-tripping could be problematic. The author's decision to keep the money might be justified as standing up for their own boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had a right to decide how to use the money, especially after feeling coerced. The mother's actions contributed to the situation by being overbearing. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
