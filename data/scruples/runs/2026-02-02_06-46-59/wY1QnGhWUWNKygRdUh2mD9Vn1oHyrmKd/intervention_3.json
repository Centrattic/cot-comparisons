I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after receiving a gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card. They told their sister about it, and the sister told the mom. The mom then insisted the author buy gifts for the sister, the cousins, and even the author's own buddy. The author felt pressured and decided not to buy anything for the family, spending the money on themselves instead. The mom got angry and there was an argument.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about the pressure the author felt. The mom's behavior seems a bit over the top. She didn't just ask but was \"obnoxious\" and pushy, adding more people to the list after the initial request. The author is 15, which is a teenager, so maybe they're still learning about money and family dynamics.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, not giving gifts might be seen as selfish. But on the other hand, the mom's behavior was possibly manipulative. The author tried to set boundaries, and the mom kept pushing. The author had the right to decide how to use their own money, even if it's a gift card. Family expectations can be heavy, especially when there's a power imbalance.\n\nAnother angle: the mom gave the gift card to the author, then expected the author to share. But if the mom didn't intend for the author to keep it, maybe she shouldn't have given it. The author's decision to not buy gifts could be a reaction to the mom's greed, as the author mentioned. The final argument where the author accuses the mom of being greedy supports that.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They were under pressure, the mom kept adding people, and the author chose to prioritize their own spending. The mom's actions were more at fault. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
