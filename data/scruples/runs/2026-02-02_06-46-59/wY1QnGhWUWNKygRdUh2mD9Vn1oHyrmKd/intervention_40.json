I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, and their sister saw it. The sister called the author, asked where it came from, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, and then started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the whole family. The author felt this was too much, especially since the cousins are young and they don't see each other often. The author decided not to spend the money on family gifts and instead kept it for themselves and a friend. The mom then got upset and yelled at them.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were being greedy and felt pressured, so they decided to keep their money. The mom was acting like she owned the gift card, which the author didn't like. The key points here are the age of the author, the sudden pressure from the family, and the fact that the author used the gift card for their own needs, which is technically allowed since it was their money.\n\nNow, considering the age: 15-year-olds are still developing their social and financial responsibility skills. They might not fully understand the expectations of gift-giving in a family context. However, the mom's behavior might be problematic. She didn't own the gift card and was pressuring the child to use it for family gifts, which could be seen as overstepping. The author was clear they didn't want to spend on cousins they don't see often, which is a valid point. Also, the fact that the mom found out through the sister despite the author's request not to tell adds to the frustration.\n\nBut then again, in many families, there's an expectation to give gifts during Christmas, especially to immediate family. The author might have felt it was unfair to be pressured to spend on cousins, but maybe there's an expectation to at least get something for parents and siblings. The author did give to a friend and bought candy, which might be seen as prioritizing their own needs over family, but they have a right to their money.\n\nThe mom's reaction could be seen as harsh, especially yelling and guilt-tripping. However, the author hung up and ignored calls, which could be seen as disrespectful. The conflict here is mutual: the mom overstepped by pressuring, and the author reacted by cutting off communication. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the money is theirs. They can choose how to spend it. The mom's behavior is questionable because she didn't own the gift card and was pressuring the child. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances. However, the way the author handled the conflict (ignoring calls and confronting the mom) might be seen as immature. \n\nBut considering the age and the situation, the main issue is the mom's overreach. The author isn't in the wrong for keeping their money, even if it goes against family expectations. The expectations might not be fair, especially for a teenager who's learning financial independence. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to their money and the mom's behavior was obnoxious.\n"
