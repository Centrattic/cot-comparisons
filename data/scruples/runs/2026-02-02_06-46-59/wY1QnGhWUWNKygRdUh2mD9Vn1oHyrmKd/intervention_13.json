I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members. The situation is that the author got a $400 gift card, told their sister but not their mom, and then their mom found out and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the whole family, including cousins. The author ended up keeping the money for themselves and got in an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old. At that age, financial management and social expectations might still be developing. The mom pressured the author after they found out about the gift card, which the author had specifically asked the sister not to tell her. The mom then added more people to the list, which the author found unreasonable, especially since the cousins are young and they don't see them often.\n\nThe author's main point is that the family members were being \"obnoxious\" and greedy, leading them to change their mind about giving gifts. They spent the money on themselves and a friend. The mom was upset and tried to guilt-trip them. The author's response was defensive, pointing out the mom's greed.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, refusing to give gifts to family members, especially when they might expect it during Christmas, could be seen as selfish. However, the pressure from the mom and sister after the author tried to keep the gift card private adds complexity. The mom's reaction might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author didn't initially plan to buy gifts for all those people.\n\nThe author's decision to keep the money could be justified if they felt pressured or if the gifts were an unexpected obligation. But cultural norms around gift-giving vary, and in many contexts, not giving gifts to immediate family might be frowned upon. However, the author's age is a factor. At 15, they might not have a steady income, and the mom's insistence on buying for cousins could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. The author said they agreed to get gifts for their mom and sister but then the mom added cousins. The author's refusal might be justified if they felt the request was excessive given their financial situation or the relationship with those cousins. The fact that the cousins are young and not seen often could support the author's position.\n\nThe author's choice to spend on themselves and a friend might be seen as selfish, but if they were under pressure and the money was a windfall they didn't expect to share, it's understandable. The conflict here is between personal autonomy and family expectations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if they felt the pressure was unwarranted. However, completely refusing to give gifts to family without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the mom's actions, the author's response is more about standing up for their own money after being pressured.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
