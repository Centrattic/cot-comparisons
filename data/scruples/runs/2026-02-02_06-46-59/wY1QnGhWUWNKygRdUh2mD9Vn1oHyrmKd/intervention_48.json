I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members. The situation is that the author got a $400 Target gift card and initially planned to buy gifts for their mom and sister. But when their mom added the cousins, the author decided not to buy anything else and used the money for themselves. \n\nFirst, gift-giving is often a personal choice. The author did mention they are very conservative with money. The mom's behavior of pressuring them to buy more gifts, especially for cousins they don't see often, might have contributed to the author's decision. \n\nThe key points here are consent and pressure. The author didn't have to spend the money on family, but the mom kept adding people and giving ultimatums. The author might feel that their autonomy over their own money is important, especially since the gift card wasn't a gift from the family. \n\nHowever, the author did initially agree to buy gifts for mom and sister, then changed their mind after the mom added more people. That could be seen as a breach of their initial agreement. Also, the argument and the way the author handled it might have been confrontational. \n\nBut considering the mom's behavior was pressuring and greedy, as the author felt, their response might be justified. At 15, the author is learning financial responsibility and personal boundaries. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping by controlling the child's money. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the pressure from the mom was unreasonable. If the mom used the gift card to guilt-trip the author into spending on others, that's a problem. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending after feeling pressured could be seen as self-advocacy. \n\nBut there's a line where the author did make a commitment and then changed it without communication, which could be inconsiderate. However, given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The final answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they stood up to pressure and managed their own money, especially when the family's demands were excessive.\n"
