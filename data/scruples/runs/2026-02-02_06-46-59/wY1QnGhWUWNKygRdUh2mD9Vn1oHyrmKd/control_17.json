I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for their family. The situation is that the author won a gift card, mentioned it on social media where their sister saw, and then their mom found out and kept adding pressure to buy gifts for multiple relatives. The author ended up spending the money on themselves and got in a fight with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's age. They're 15, which is a teenager. At that age, they might still be learning about personal boundaries and money management. The parents might expect some level of generosity during Christmas, especially within the family. But the author felt pressured, and the mom's actions were abrupt and maybe overstepping. \n\nThe key points: The gift card was a personal win. The author initially intended to get gifts but felt pressured when the mom added more people and seemed greedy. The author decided to use the money for themselves, which led to conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one side, refusing to buy gifts for family could be seen as selfish, especially in a holiday context. On the other hand, the parents' behavior might have contributed by being pushy and making the author feel that their money is not their own. \n\nThe author's reaction was to stand up for their own money and decide how to spend it, which is a reasonable stance for someone learning about financial independence. The mom's guilt-tripping and the pressure might not have been fair. \n\nSo, considering the pressure from the mother and the author's age, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The situation shows a conflict between family expectations and the individual's right to manage their own money. The author's decision, while it caused a rift, is a valid choice in this context.\n"
