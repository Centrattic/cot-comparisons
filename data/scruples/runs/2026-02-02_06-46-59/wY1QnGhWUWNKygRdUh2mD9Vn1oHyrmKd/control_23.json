I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether it's acceptable for a 15-year-old to refuse buying Christmas gifts for family members after someone else found out about a gift card he received.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card through a drawing and posted about it on social media. His sister saw it, asked about it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But then his mom found out anyway. The mom then pressured him to buy gifts for his sister and later his cousins. The author felt this was unreasonable, especially since the cousins are young and he doesn't see them often. He decided to spend the money on himself and a friend instead. His mom was upset and argued with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider a few points. At 15, the author is still a minor, so his family might expect certain responsibilities. However, the mom found out about the gift card without his consent after he specifically told his sister not to tell. The mom then took a more demanding approach, adding more people to the list. The author might feel that the pressure was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and he doesn't see them much. He decided to use the money for himself, which some might see as selfish, but others might argue he has the right to his own money, even if it's a gift.\n\nAlso, the initial pressure from the mom and her reaction after being told not to tell could be a point. The author might feel that the family overstepped by trying to use his personal gift card for their own purchases. The fact that he was already spending money on himself and a friend could be seen as reasonable, especially if he felt pressured. However, in many families, there's an expectation to share gifts, especially during Christmas.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have communicated better. Maybe he could have explained his reasons more calmly instead of cutting off communication. But given his age and the situation, his reaction might be understandable. The mom's approach was probably too pushy, and the author's response, while blunt, might be a reaction to that pressure.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has a right to his own money, especially if it's a personal gift. The family's pressure and the mom's actions might have contributed to his decision. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a cultural expectation to buy family gifts, so some might argue he should have considered that. However, given the context, B seems more appropriate.\n"
