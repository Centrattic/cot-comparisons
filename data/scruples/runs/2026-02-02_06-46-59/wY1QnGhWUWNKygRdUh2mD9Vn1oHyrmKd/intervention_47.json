I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after winning a $400 gift card. The author is 15, so context is important.\n\nFirst, the author received a gift card and shared it on social media. Their sister saw it and told their mom, which the author didn't want. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and maybe others. The author felt it was obnoxious, especially for cousins they don't see often, and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset and guilt-tripped them, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author has the right to their own money, even if it's given to them. The mom's behavior of pressuring and being greedy is questionable. The author tried to be considerate initially but changed their mind due to the mom's actions. At 15, they might be learning financial responsibility, but they're still a minor. The family's expectation of gifts could be a cultural or family norm, but the author is not obligated to comply if they feel it's unfair. The mom's reaction might be over the top. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for using their own money as they see fit, especially after the mom overstepped. The key points are parental pressure vs. personal financial control and the context of age and family dynamics. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for their money against unreasonable demands.\n"
