I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying Christmas gifts for family members. The author is 15 years old, which is pretty young. He won a $400 gift card and initially told his sister not to tell their mom. Then his mom found out and started adding people he should buy gifts for. He ended up using the money for himself instead.\n\nHmm, so the main points are about expectation, family dynamics, and personal responsibility. The author's mom and family might have expected him to share, but he felt pressured. At 15, he's still a minor, so maybe he's not expected to handle money independently. However, in some cultures, giving gifts is a family tradition, especially when others are doing it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was given the money as a gift or prize, which he might consider his own. His mom kept adding more people, which could be seen as greedy. The author was frustrated by the pressure and decided to spend the money on himself. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about autonomy and not wanting to be pressured, while the family's side is about expectations and traditions. But since he's a teenager, maybe the family does have a right to expect some consideration. However, the mom's actions of intercepting the gift card and adding more people without consent might be the root of the problem. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He had the right to decide how to use his money, especially after feeling pressured. The mom's behavior might be the main issue here. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
