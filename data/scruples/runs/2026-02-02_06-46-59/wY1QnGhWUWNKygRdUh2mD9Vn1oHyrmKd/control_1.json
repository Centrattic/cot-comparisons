I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author, who is 15, got a $400 gift card. They shared it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway and insisted the author buy gifts for the sister and themselves. Then, when at Target, the mom added two cousins, 6 and 2 years old. The author refuses, spends the money on themselves, and gets into an argument.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author, 15, they're a minor. In many cultures, families have expectations around gift-giving, but there's also a lot of pressure here. The mom's behavior seems to be escalating\u2014first sister and mom, then cousins, and being \"thoughtful\" with money. The author might feel that their money is being controlled, especially since it's a gift card they earned. The mom's actions (checking the gift card, adding more people) could be seen as overstepping. The author is trying to assert control over their own money, which is a valid stance, especially if the mom was being demanding. However, there's a cultural aspect where kids might be expected to share family gifts. But since the author explicitly refused and stood their ground, maybe it's a matter of perspective. The mom's guilt-tripping and the author's frustration make sense. Given the age and the context, the author's actions might be justified as they're learning financial independence. So, the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
