I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 15, got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, and their sister saw it. The sister told the mom, and the mom then started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the family, including the author's siblings and cousins. The author decided not to buy gifts and instead spent the money on themselves and a friend. The mom got upset and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They were 15, which is pretty young, and maybe they're still learning about financial responsibility and family expectations. The author was already planning to buy gifts for mom and sister but felt pressured when the mom added cousins into the mix. The author might feel that they were being forced to spend money they didn't want to spend, especially since the cousins are young and not close. The mom's approach might have been overbearing, making the author defensive.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's perspective is important. Parents often expect children, even teenagers, to contribute to family traditions like gift-giving. The author had the means (a $400 gift card) and maybe the mom thought it was reasonable to buy for the family. The author didn't communicate their decision effectively, leading to conflict. The mom might feel that the author was being selfish or disrespectful by changing their mind after the fact.\n\nBut the author didn't explicitly agree to buy gifts for cousins when the mom added them later. The initial agreement was only for mom and sister. The mom might have overstepped by adding more people without the author's consent. Also, the cousins are 6 and 2, so maybe the author feels it's not necessary to spend much on them. The author's decision to use the money as they saw fit could be seen as a right, especially since the gift card was a personal win.\n\nHowever, the way the author handled it could be problematic. They might have been more considerate in not just hanging up on their mom and cutting off communication. The mom probably wanted to ensure everyone felt included, and the sudden change without discussion might have hurt her feelings. The author's response of calling the mom greedy might have been harsh, even if justified in their mind.\n\nConsidering the age factor, 15-year-olds are still developing emotional and social skills. The situation might be a clash between the author's growing independence and the family's expectations. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to manage their own money, but they could have approached the conflict more diplomatically. The mom's pressure was excessive, but the author could have tried to negotiate rather than completely ignoring the calls. The key points are the lack of communication and the mom's overreach in adding cousins without consent.\n\nSo, the answer might be a bit balanced, but since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the factors that weigh more are the mom's pressure and the author's right to their own money. However, the author's refusal to communicate further and the harsh words might tip it towards them being at least partially at fault. But given the mom's actions, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. Hmm.\n"
