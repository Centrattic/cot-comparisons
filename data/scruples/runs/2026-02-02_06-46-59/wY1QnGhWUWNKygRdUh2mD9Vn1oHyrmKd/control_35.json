I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation involves the author getting a $400 gift card, which their sister found out about. The mother then insisted the author use the gift card to buy gifts for the sister and the author's cousins. The author decided not to and spent the money on themselves instead, leading to a conflict with the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author, 15 years old. At that age, financial independence and family expectations can clash. The author is described as very conservative with money, so spending $400 on family gifts might be a big deal for them. \n\nThe mother's insistence seems to be a key point. The author mentions that the mother was \"obnoxiously\" telling them to get gifts for the sister and cousins, even adding two more people (the young cousins) after the initial request. The author felt pressured and that their privacy was invaded when the mother took the gift card. The fact that the cousins are young and not part of the author's regular life might make the obligation to buy gifts for them feel unreasonable. \n\nThe author's decision to use the gift card for personal items is their choice, but the family dynamics here are important. The mother's reaction, including guilt-tripping and yelling, complicates the situation. The author's frustration stems from the mother's greed and overstepping boundaries by taking the gift card. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural and family norms. In many cultures, it's customary to give gifts to family during Christmas, but the pressure here seems excessive. The author isn't obligated to spend money on family if they find the expectations unfair. However, the public refusal and the argument with the mother might have caused hurt feelings. \n\nConsidering the age and the context, the author might be justified in prioritizing their own needs, especially if the family's demands were unreasonable. The mother's overreach in taking the gift card and adding unexpected recipients (the cousins) without the author's consent could be seen as the main issue here. The author's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, is a response to being pushed into a financial commitment they weren't comfortable with. \n\nSo, balancing the expectations of family gift-giving against the author's right to manage their own money, it seems the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mother's actions and the pressure applied might have contributed to the conflict.\n"
