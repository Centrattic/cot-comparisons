I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a gift card. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author got a $400 Target gift card. They told their sister, then their mom found out and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the sister, mom, and cousins. The cousins are young, so maybe that's why the author feels it's not necessary. The author got annoyed and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset and accused the author of being greedy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author is 15, which is a teenager. They received the gift card through a drawing, so it's their own money to use as they see fit. The family members started pressuring them to use the card for gifts for others, which the author found obnoxious. The author decided not to buy gifts for the people who pressured them, especially since they don't see the cousins often.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility perspective, the author is being cautious and using their own money to buy what they want. They did buy a gift for a friend, which shows they still gave, just not to their family. The mom's reaction might be seen as overstepping, especially since she didn't ask the author's permission to use the gift card. \n\nHowever, there's a cultural aspect here. In many cultures, giving gifts during Christmas is a tradition, and family might expect it. The author might be seen as breaking that tradition, which could cause tension. But the other side is that the family members were pressuring them, which is unfair. The author's right to their own money is important here. \n\nThe key factors are: the author's money, the pressure from family, and the tradition vs. personal choice. Since the gift card was a personal prize, the author isn't obligated to use it for family gifts. The mom's behavior of taking the card and adding more people might have been a trigger. \n\nConsidering that the author is 15, they might not have a lot of money and are learning financial responsibility. Their decision to prioritize their own needs and a friend's gift over family could be seen as reasonable, especially after the family's pressure. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a right to their money and the family's pressure seems excessive. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
