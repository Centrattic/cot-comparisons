I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card they won in a drawing. They posted about it on Instagram, and their sister saw it. The sister called to ask about the gift card, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway. The mom then insisted the author use the gift card to buy gifts for the author's sister, the author's mom, and even two cousins (who are young and not often seen). The author refused, bought gifts for themselves and a friend, and got into an argument with the mom.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author didn't want to share the gift card money, but their mom and sister pushed for using it to buy gifts for the family. The author decided not to buy gifts for their family members after feeling pressured, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the gift card was the author's own money, and they might have the right to spend it however they want. However, since they live in a family context, there might be expectations around giving gifts during Christmas. The mom might have felt it was a family tradition or an opportunity to share the good fortune.\n\nBut the author was 15, which is a minor, and while they might have some autonomy, their parents might still have some say in family matters. The author's mom did approach them and ask for gifts, and the author initially agreed but then changed their mind. The mom's reaction could be seen as frustration over the broken promise. However, the pressure to spend beyond what's reasonable (especially on cousins they don't see often) could be an issue.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had an obligation to give gifts. Since they didn't agree to it upfront and the gift card was theirs, maybe they weren't in the wrong. But maybe there's an expectation in their family to share such windfalls. The author's response of cutting off gifts entirely after the mom asked for more might be seen as a bit of a overreaction, but maybe justified if the mom was being pushy.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and family expectations. However, since the author was given the gift card through their own effort (a win), they might have the right to use it as they see fit. The family's pressure could have been unreasonable. But refusing to give gifts might be seen as selfish, especially during a time like Christmas. \n\nBut considering the author's age and their financial independence (being very conservative with money), they might not have the same obligations as adults. Also, the mom did pressure them after finding out about the gift card, which could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and a friend's gift might be reasonable, especially if they felt the pressure was undue.\n\nSo, balancing all that, maybe the author is not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
