I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members. The situation is that the author received a $400 Target gift card, told their sister, who then told their mom. The mom and sister kept adding more people to the list, and the author eventually decided not to buy anything for family, using the money to buy themselves stuff instead. The author is 15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was 15 when this happened. At that age, people are still developing their understanding of social norms and family dynamics. The author was given a gift card that they found themselves, and they were pressured by their mother to buy gifts for multiple family members, even extending to cousins. The author felt it was unfair because they don't see those cousins often. \n\nThe mother's behavior seems to be a significant factor here. She initially asked for gifts for the sister and then added the cousins, even specifying not to get cheap gifts. The author felt this was excessive and obnoxious. The author's response was to stop buying gifts and instead use the money for themselves, which led to conflict with the mother.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are the expectations within the family. If the family typically exchanges gifts, the author might be expected to participate. However, the author was given the gift card without prior knowledge and was pressured into using it for others. The sudden increase in the number of people to buy for, especially for cousins the author doesn't see, might be seen as the mother overstepping. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending could be seen as a reasonable response to the pressure, especially if they felt the expectations were unreasonable.\n\nAdditionally, the author's age is a factor. At 15, they might not have the same financial responsibilities as an adult, and their conservative approach to money is mentioned. The mother's reaction, including guilt-tripping, might have escalated the situation. The author's statement about the mother being greedy and keeping her \"paws off\" the money suggests a conflict over financial independence, which is a valid concern for a teenager learning to manage their own money.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They were given a gift card, faced with increasing pressure to spend it on others, and chose to use the money as they saw fit after feeling pressured. The mother's actions contributed to the conflict, and the author's response was a reaction to that pressure. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
