I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway. The author agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister initially. Then, when at Target, the mom called again and added two cousins, giving the gift card to them and their brother. The author hung up and decided not to buy any gifts, instead spending the money on themselves and a friend. The mom was upset, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author. At 15, they might still be learning about social norms and family expectations. The situation involves gifts and money management. The author received an unexpected gift and might have felt entitled to use it as they saw fit. However, when they initially agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister, that commitment was made. Then the mom added cousins, which the author found surprising and unnecessary since the cousins aren't close.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister but felt pressured when the mom added cousins without prior discussion. The problem might be that the author didn't set clear boundaries from the start. By agreeing first and then changing their mind when more people were added, it could be seen as breaking a commitment. However, the mom's behavior\u2014being obnoxious and adding more people without asking\u2014might have justified the author's frustration.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author being very conservative with money. If they had the right to decide how to spend the gift card, maybe their initial agreement was sincere but became a problem when the mom added others. The author's response of hanging up and ignoring calls could be seen as rude, but the mom's guilt-tripping might have escalated the situation.\n\nConsidering the mom's actions: she found out about the gift card despite being asked not to, then added more people without the author's input. The author might have felt their autonomy was violated. However, the author's dad isn't mentioned, so maybe the mom is the primary caregiver. The author's decision to not buy gifts could be seen as inconsiderate, but the context of pressure and lack of communication plays a role.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to give gifts to close family during Christmas. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish, especially since they had the means. But the way the mom handled it\u2014being obnoxious and not respecting the author's financial boundaries\u2014could have pushed the author to act out. The author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to the mom's overreach and pressure. However, they didn't communicate their decision properly, leading to conflict.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's actions were justified given the mom's behavior. If the mom had asked respectfully and the author had set limits beforehand, maybe the situation would be different. But the author's decision to change their mind without discussing it with the mom, especially after agreeing, could be seen as inconsiderate. Yet, the mom's obnoxious behavior might have made the author feel justified in their actions. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on perspective. If the author had a right to their money and the mom overstepped, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author should have honored their commitment despite the pressure, then they are. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I should consider if the author's refusal is reasonable. The mom's guilt-tripping and added demands without prior agreement could have crossed a line. The author's response, while abrupt, might be a reaction to that. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because the mom's behavior was controlling and the author was within their right to decide how to use their gift. However, the way they handled the conflict could have been better. The main issue is the mom's pressure and the author's boundary. The age factor might also mean the author is learning, so strict judgment isn't fair. So, the answer is B.\n"
