I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 gift card. The person is 15 years old, which is a key detail.\n\nFirst, the author received a gift card and initially intended to buy gifts for family members but changed their mind after feeling pressured. The mother and sister started pressuring them after finding out about the gift card. The author felt this pressure was excessive and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. \n\nNow, considering the age of the person involved, 15 is a young age where financial independence might not be expected. However, the situation involves family dynamics and expectations. The author's decision to not buy gifts could be seen as a personal choice, especially considering they are very conservative with money and felt pressured. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that the child should share the gift with family, especially since it was a windfall. The author's mom did call them out for not getting gifts for cousins, which adds to the tension. The argument here is about the right to use personal money versus family obligations.\n\nThe key factors are the age, the pressure from family, and the author's right to their own money. While family expectations exist, the author's decision to prioritize their own spending is a personal choice. The mother's reaction might be seen as overstepping if she was pressuring without considering the child's perspective. \n\nHowever, the author did mention that they were already conservative with money and the added pressure caused frustration. The fact that the gift card was a windfall might influence the situation, as the author wasn't obligated to use it for family gifts. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But considering the age and the pressure applied, the author's choice might be justified as a personal decision. The mother's demands could be seen as unreasonable, especially regarding the cousins, which are young and the author doesn't see them often. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to decide how to use their money, especially after feeling pressured. The mother's actions might have contributed to the author's decision to prioritize their own spending.\n"
