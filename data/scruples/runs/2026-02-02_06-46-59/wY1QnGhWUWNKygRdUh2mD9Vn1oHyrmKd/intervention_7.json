I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old who refused to buy gifts for family members after winning a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The kid got a gift card, told his sister, who then told their mom. The mom then pressured him to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and himself. The kid felt it was too much, especially for cousins he doesn't see often, and decided to spend the money on himself instead. Now the mom is upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Is the author obligated to buy gifts for family members? The mom didn't give him money; he got the gift card himself. So maybe he's not required. However, the mom did ask him to buy gifts, and he agreed before changing his mind. The argument is about expectations and boundaries.\n\nAt 15, family dynamics can be tricky. The mom's reaction might be seen as overstepping if the kid clearly stated he wanted to keep the money for himself. But the kid initially agreed, then went back on it, leading to the mom's disappointment. The sister was also involved in revealing the gift card, which might add to the tension.\n\nIs the kid wrong for changing his mind? If he had the right to decide how to use his own money, then maybe not. But if he agreed to buy gifts and then refused, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the mom's pressure might have contributed to his decision. The kid's age might also be a factor in how responsibilities and expectations are viewed.\n\nAnother angle: the kid felt the pressure to buy gifts for people he doesn't see often (6 and 2-year-olds). It's reasonable to question the necessity of such purchases. The mom's demand for \"thoughtful\" gifts, not just cheap ones, might have been a stressor. The kid's frustration led him to prioritize his own spending, which he felt was justified given the pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid did agree to buy gifts initially, then changed his mind without completing the purchases. This could be seen as unreliable or disrespectful to the family's expectations. However, the family might have overstepped by being too greedy or demanding, which the kid pointed out in their argument.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, gift-giving during Christmas is often expected, but it's also a personal choice. The kid's decision to spend on himself could be seen as self-centered, but if the family didn't contribute to the gift card, maybe it's their own money to use as they wish.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the kid had the right to his own money, the mom overstepped by pressuring him to spend it on others, and the kid's frustration is valid. The initial agreement might be a point against him, but the context of pressure and the mom's reaction complicates it. The kid's age also plays a role; at 15, managing family expectations can be challenging, and his decision to set boundaries is understandable.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the kid has the right to his own money and the mom's pressure was excessive. However, the fact that he agreed and then changed his mind could tip the balance. But given the mom's overreaction and the kid's age, B seems right.\n"
