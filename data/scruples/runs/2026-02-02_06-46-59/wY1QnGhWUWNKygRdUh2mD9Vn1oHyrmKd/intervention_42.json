I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The author is 15, so that's a factor. \n\nFirst, the author received a gift card and shared it on social media, which their sister saw. The mom then called the author's sister and found out about the gift card. The author tried to keep it a secret, but the mom still demanded gifts for the mom and sister. Then the mom added cousins into the mix, which the author found unreasonable because the cousins are young and not seen often.\n\nThe author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves, which upset the mom. The mom then tried to guilt-trip the author, leading to an argument. The author defended their decision by saying the mom was greedy and took advantage of their money.\n\nNow, considering the situation, family dynamics play a big role. In many cultures, giving gifts during Christmas is a tradition, and family members might expect it. However, the author is a minor with limited financial independence. The mom's behavior might be seen as overstepping, especially after the author tried to keep the gift card private and then the mom kept adding more people. The author's response of cutting off communication and spending the money on themselves could be seen as self-assertion, but it's also understandable that parents might feel hurt or upset when their children don't follow family traditions.\n\nBut the author was 15, so they might not have a lot of money to begin with. The mom might expect the gift card to be used for family gifts, but the author is trying to manage their own finances. The key points here are the mom's pressure after the author tried to keep the gift card a secret and the unreasonable addition of cousins. The author's decision could be seen as standing up for their own money, but it's also a family tradition that they chose to ignore, which could hurt feelings.\n\nIn many cases, family expectations versus personal financial boundaries can lead to conflict. The author might be in the right for not feeling obligated to spend money they earned, especially if it's their own, but the situation is complicated by the family's expectations. However, the mom's actions of calling the sister and then the author, and then adding more people after the initial request, might have been excessive. The author's frustration is valid, but their response of cutting off communication and spending the money on themselves might be seen as selfish from the family's perspective.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they were defending their own money against what they felt was pressure and greed. But there's a balance between family traditions and personal boundaries. Since the author is a minor, the family might expect them to contribute, but the mom's approach might have been too much. So, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, the key factors are the mother's overreach and the author's right to control their own money, even if it's a gift they received.\n"
