I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family Christmas gifts after getting a gift card. The author is 15, which is important. They won a $400 gift card, shared it on Instagram where their sister saw, then their mom found out and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, etc. The author felt pressured and ended up spending the money on themselves instead, leading to a fight with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author might feel that their money is their own, especially since they earned it through a drawing. But since they're a minor, their parents might have some authority over their finances. However, the author is 15, so maybe there's a balance between parental guidance and personal autonomy.\n\nThe mom's actions: she found out about the gift card, maybe without permission, then pressured the author to buy gifts for multiple people. She even called the author to add more people to the list. The author felt this was excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often. The mom's behavior might have been overstepping, using guilt and pressure, which led the author to rebel.\n\nThe author's actions: Initially agreed to buy gifts for mom and sister but then the mom added cousins. The author changed their mind, spent the money on themselves, and confronted the mom. They might be in the wrong if they were supposed to follow through with the gift-giving expectation, but the mom's approach was problematic. However, the author is a teenager, and their right to manage their own money could be a factor, especially if it was a personal win.\n\nLegally, as a minor, the parents might have control over the child's finances. But emotionally, the author felt manipulated, which is a valid feeling. The key points are the pressure from the mom, the age of the author, and the reasonable expectation of gift-giving during Christmas. If the author was supposed to use the gift card for others, but the mom kept expanding the list in a demanding way, maybe the author's refusal is justified.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and the balance of fairness. The author's frustration with the mom's greed and pressure might make others sympathize with them. The mom's overreach could mean the author isn't in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if the author's refusal without considering family expectations is unreasonable. However, given the mom's behavior, the author's response is understandable. So, B seems right.\n"
