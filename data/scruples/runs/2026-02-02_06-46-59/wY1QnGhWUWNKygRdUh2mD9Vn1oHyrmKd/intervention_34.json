I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the 15-year-old author of this situation is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The kid won the gift card and shared it on social media, which his sister saw. His mom found out and started pressuring him to buy gifts for multiple family members, including his sister and cousins. He felt it was his money and didn't want to spend it on people he doesn't see often (the cousins are 6 and 2 years old). He ended up spending the money on himself and a friend, leading to an argument with his mom.\n\nNow, the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Ownership of the Gift Card**: The gift card was given to the author, so it's his money. He's within his rights to spend it as he chooses. However, in many families, there's an unspoken expectation to share or buy gifts for family members, especially for holidays like Christmas. But that's more of a social expectation than a legal obligation.\n\n2. **Parental Pressure**: The mother's reaction might be seen as overstepping. She called him greedy and tried to guilt-trip him. But is her pressure unreasonable? Families often have different norms, but pressuring someone, especially a teenager, to spend their money can be frustrating. The author's mom might have expected him to share, but her approach was obnoxious, as he mentioned.\n\n3. **Author's Age and Financial Responsibility**: At 15, the author is still under his parents' care. There's a balance between teaching responsibility and respecting personal choices. The mother might feel it's important to teach generosity, while the author sees it as forced spending. However, the author is also learning financial independence, which is a valid aspect of growing up.\n\n4. **Cousins' Inclusion**: The cousins are very young, and the author doesn't see them often. It's understandable he might not want to spend on them, especially if he doesn't have a close relationship. The mom's insistence on thoughtful gifts for young kids could be seen as unreasonable, given their infrequent interactions.\n\n5. **Communication and Conflict**: The author's response to his mom was a bit confrontational (\"greedy\" comment), which might have escalated the situation. However, standing up for his decision is part of establishing personal boundaries. The mom's reaction (slamming the door) suggests she was upset, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong in his stance.\n\n6. **Social Norms vs. Personal Choice**: In many cultures, giving gifts to family during Christmas is a tradition, but it's not a strict rule. The author's decision to prioritize his own needs and a friend over family could be seen as selfish, especially if the family expects it. However, the pressure from the mom and sister might have pushed him to push back.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author has a valid point about the sudden pressure on his money and the inclusion of family members he doesn't see often. However, the expectation to give gifts might be part of the family's traditions, which he didn't consider. The conflict arises from differing values: his desire for autonomy and her expectation of sharing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't legally in the wrong for not buying gifts, as he owns the money. However, socially, there's an argument that the family's expectations were unmet. But the mother's approach was overbearing, which justified his frustration. Since the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but the analysis shows it's nuanced, the answer would depend on prioritizing either the author's rights to his money or the family's expectations. Given the mother's obnoxious behavior and the author's reasons for not giving, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
