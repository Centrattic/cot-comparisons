I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for family members after receiving a gift card. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card and mentioned it on social media where his sister saw. He told his sister not to tell his mom, but she did. Then his mom came in and told him he had to get gifts for his sister and mom. The author agreed but was frustrated. Then his mom added cousins, which he found unreasonable because they don't see them often. He refused and bought himself stuff instead. His mom was upset, and there was an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial expectation. The author didn't plan to buy gifts for everyone, but once the gift card was known, his mom added more people. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for himself. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom one angle, the author is 15, and while he's managing his own money, family expectations might be different. Gift-giving during Christmas is a common tradition, so refusing to give gifts might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the mom's behavior seems to have escalated\u2014she didn't stick to the initial request and added more people after the fact. The author felt pressured and didn't consent to the additional gifts. Also, the mom didn't respect his boundaries when she took the gift card and told him what to do. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had the money and chose to keep it all. While he might not be obligated to spend on family, the way he handled it\u2014refusing after agreeing initially\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust or poor communication. But considering the mom's actions were overstepping, like checking the gift card and adding more people without his consent, the author's refusal might be justified.\n\nAge is a factor too. At 15, he's still learning about money management and social norms. The mom's demands might be too much for him, especially if she's not respecting his autonomy. The author's explanation shows he's being very conservative with his money, which is a valid approach. However, the sudden change after agreeing might be seen as inconsiderate, but given the circumstances, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nSo, I think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't in the wrong because the mom's behavior was overbearing. The initial agreement was for his mom and sister, but the mom added more people without his consent. The author's decision to protect his money and refuse further demands is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
