I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Christmas gifts and a family conflict. The user is 15 years old, so that's a key factor.\n\nFirst, the author received a $400 gift card. They told their sister but asked her not to tell their mom. Then the mom found out and insisted the author buy gifts for multiple family members. The author felt pressured and decided not to buy gifts, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the family was being greedy and pressuring them to spend their own money. They're 15, so they might not have much income, and the gift card was a windfall. The mom added more people to the list after the initial request, which made the author feel overwhelmed.\n\nOn the other hand, in many cultures, Christmas is a time for gift-giving, and family might expect contributions. The mom's insistence could be seen as overstepping, but maybe she's just following traditions. The author didn't inform their mom about the change of plans, leading to disappointment.\n\nThe author is being honest about their feelings and standing up for their money, which is a valid right. However, not informing family about the change in plans might have caused unnecessary conflict. But considering the age and the pressure from family, the author's decision to prioritize their own needs isn't entirely wrong.\n\nThe key points are: the author's age, the pressure from family, and the lack of communication. The author's actions might be justified as self-responsibility, but the lack of communication could have been handled better. However, the main issue is the family's expectations versus the author's right to manage their money. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
