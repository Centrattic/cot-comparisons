I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card as a prize. They posted about it on Instagram, where their sister saw it. The sister called to ask about it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, came into the author's room, and insisted they buy gifts for the mom, sister, and later the cousins. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to a conflict with their mom.\n\nFirst, the author didn't want to buy gifts for family members they don't see often, especially since the mom kept adding more people. The mom's behavior seemed to escalate\u2014first the sister, then the mom, then the cousins. The author felt it was unfair and that their money was being demanded. They made their own decision to use the gift card for personal items, which was a choice they felt was justified because the mom was being greedy.\n\nNow, considering the age, 15 is still a minor, so the parent might expect some level of responsibility, but the author is also developing their own values about money and privacy. The mom's approach seems to have been overbearing, asking for gifts for more people after the initial request. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the mom kept pressuring them and didn't respect their financial boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The author was given the gift card as a personal prize.\n2. The mom discovered it without the author's consent and started demanding gifts.\n3. The author felt their privacy was invaded and that the mom was being greedy.\n4. The author decided to use the money for themselves, which led to conflict.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't wrong for deciding how to use their own money, especially if it's a personal prize. However, in some family dynamics, there might be an expectation to share or give gifts. But the mom's actions in this case seem to push the author's boundaries. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is a valid choice.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were using their own money as they saw fit and had the right to refuse the pressure from their mom. The mom's behavior was more at fault for not respecting the author's autonomy and financial decisions.\n"
