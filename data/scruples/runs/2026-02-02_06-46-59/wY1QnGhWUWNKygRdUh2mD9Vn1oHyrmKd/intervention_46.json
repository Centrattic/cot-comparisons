I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a gift card and shared it on Instagram, which his sister saw. His mom then pressured him to buy gifts for his sister, cousins, and maybe others. He felt this was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and he doesn't see them often. He decided to keep the money and buy himself things instead, leading to an argument with his mom.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author was given a gift card, which is a gift, and he might have felt it's his to use as he sees fit. He's 15, so maybe he's learning about money management and personal responsibility. The family's reaction, especially the mom's pressure, might have made him feel cornered. \n\nOn the other hand, when you receive a gift, there's sometimes an expectation to share, especially in family settings. The author initially agreed to buy gifts for his mom and sister but felt pressured further with cousins. The mom might feel that not buying gifts is inconsiderate, especially during a time like Christmas. The author's decision to keep everything could be seen as selfish, but he's a teenager, and his reasoning about not wanting to spend on people he doesn't see often is valid.\n\nI should consider cultural norms too. In some families, exchanging gifts is a tradition, and not participating might hurt feelings. However, the author's frustration with the pressure and the mom's overreaction might justify his actions. The key is whether the author was unreasonable in refusing. \n\nThe author did communicate his refusal, so there's no surprise. He also bought a friend a gift, showing he's not entirely against giving. His mom overstepped by pressuring him to spend on cousins he doesn't see. The author's response, while maybe confrontational, was a stand to protect his money. \n\nSo, while there's a case for both sides, the mother's pressure and the author's age and perspective might mean he's not entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he had the right to decide how to use the gift card, especially after the initial pressure.\n"
