I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The story is about a 15-year-old who received a $400 gift card, then got pressured by family to buy them gifts. They ended up using the money for themselves after feeling that their family was being greedy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points here are about the gift card, the family's reactions, and the teenager's decision. The author initially intended to buy family members gifts but changed their mind after the mother and sister intervened. The mother added more people to the list, and the author felt it was unnecessary, especially for cousins they don't see often. The author then used the money for personal items, leading to a confrontation with the mother.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author, 15, which is a minor, but maybe that's not the main factor here. The main issue is whether the author was wrong for not giving gifts. The family might see it as a duty or expectation, especially around Christmas. But the author felt pressured and that their money was being taken away. \n\nThe gift card was a personal win, and the mother's insistence on using it for family could be seen as overstepping. The author's reaction might be justified if they felt the family was being greedy or not respecting their decision. However, in some family dynamics, giving gifts is a tradition, so the author might be seen as being disrespectful or selfish for not participating. \n\nBut the author also mentions that the family members were obnoxious about it. The mother called and added cousins, which the author found unreasonable. The author had the right to decide how to spend their own money, even if it's a gift. The mother's guilt-tripping and trying to take control might have contributed to the author's decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author could have been more diplomatic, like explaining their budget constraints even after the pressure. However, the family's behavior in pressuring and possibly guilt-tripping might have crossed a line. The author's age might make them more sensitive to such control. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. They had the right to their own money and could decide not to spend it on family if they felt the pressure was too much. The family's actions might have contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
