I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old who received a $400 gift card, which was discovered by family members. The mom and sister kept adding more people to the list of whom he should buy gifts for, even though he wasn't planning to. He ended up keeping the money for himself and got into an argument with his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age. At 15, the person is a minor, so their financial responsibilities and autonomy are likely still under their parents' influence. The gift card was given to him, but if it's a family gift, does that mean it's communal? The mom taking the gift card and dictating how it's spent could be seen as overstepping. However, depending on the cultural or family norms, there might be expectations around sharing gifts, especially during holidays.\n\nThe author's frustration comes from the mom and sister pushing for more gifts after he was already planning to buy some. The mom added cousins, which the author found unreasonable since they don't see them often. The author then decides to keep the money, which leads to conflict. \n\nIs the author wrong for not buying gifts for everyone? It depends on the expectations. If the family expects everyone to give gifts to each other, the author might be seen as not participating. However, he was given the gift card, which he might feel is his to use as he sees fit. The mom's behavior\u2014bursting into his room, pressuring him to buy more, and being \"obnoxious\"\u2014could justify his reaction. \n\nBut since he's 15, maybe there's an expectation to participate in family traditions. However, the way the mom handled it, being pushy and greedy, might have crossed a line. The author's response was firm but not abusive. He stood his ground, which could be seen as asserting his right to his own money. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to spend on people he doesn't see often. The issue is more about the mom's overreaction and pressure. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his own autonomy and the family's expectations might not be fair in this context.\n"
