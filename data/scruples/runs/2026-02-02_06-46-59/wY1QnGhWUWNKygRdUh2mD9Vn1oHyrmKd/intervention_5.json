I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author is 15 years old, which is a teenager. The main points here are about refusing to buy gifts for family members after receiving a gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card and shared it on social media. The sister found out and told the mom, but the author had specifically told the sister not to tell the mom. Then the mom came in and demanded the author spend the gift card on the author's mom and sister. The author agreed but later, when the mom added cousins, the author refused. The author then used the gift card for themselves and friends instead, leading to a conflict with the mom.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms around Christmas gifts, especially in families, there's an expectation of giving gifts to family members, especially during the holidays. The author's mom might have felt that since the author had the means, they should contribute to the family's gift-giving. The author's refusal could be seen as selfish, especially since they had initially agreed to get gifts for the mom and sister but then changed their mind when more family members were added.\n\nHowever, the author is 15, so their perspective might be influenced by their age. Teenagers might have different views on money and personal autonomy. The author felt pressured when the mom kept increasing the list of people to buy for, and the mom's tone was described as obnoxious. The author might feel that their money (even if it was a gift card) is their own to spend as they like, especially if it's not a shared family asset.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of family gift-giving, the pressure from the mother, the age of the author, and the concept of personal finances. In many cultures, there's an unspoken rule that receiving a gift card from a source (though in this case, it was won by the author) might not obligate them to spend it on others. However, if the gift card was considered part of the family's shared resources (which might not be the case here), then there could be different expectations.\n\nThe author's decision to spend the gift card on themselves and friends might be seen as reasonable if they felt the pressure was too much. However, the initial agreement to buy gifts for the mom and sister, then backtracking when more people were added, might be seen as inconsistent. Also, the mom's reaction could be influenced by her own expectations and cultural norms, which might not consider the teenager's perspective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on cultural and family norms. If the expectation was that the author would use the gift card for family gifts, then the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the author believes the money is their own and the mother's demands were unreasonable, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Considering the age, teenagers often start valuing their independence, so the author's stance might be developmentally appropriate.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because there's an expectation in many families to give gifts during Christmas, especially when you have the means. The author had the opportunity to consider their family but chose not to, which might be seen as selfish. However, the mother's approach was also heavy-handed. But since the question is about the author's responsibility, the answer leans towards A.\n"
