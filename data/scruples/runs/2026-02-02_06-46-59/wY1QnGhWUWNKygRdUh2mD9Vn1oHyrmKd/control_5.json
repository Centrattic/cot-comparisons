I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The author is 15 years old, which might be a factor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author got a gift card, mentioned it on social media, and then family members started pressuring them to use it for gifts. The mom and sister got involved, adding more people (the cousins) into the mix. The author felt it was their money and didn't want to spend it on family, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen. They ended up spending on themselves and a friend instead, leading to a conflict with their mom.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, the gift card is the author's money, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. Family expectations might differ. In many cultures, exchanging gifts is customary, but it's not a legal obligation. The author's mom might have expected it, but the author wasn't required to comply. The key points here are autonomy over personal finances and the expectation of gift-giving. The author's frustration with the pressure and the mom's overreaction are also factors.\n\nConsidering the age, 15 is a teenager who's still learning financial independence. The mom's pressure could be seen as overstepping, especially if the gift card was a personal win. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and a friend might be justified. The mom's guilt-tripping and yelling could indicate poor communication. The fact that the author had to deal with unexpected pressure from family might support their stance.\n\nHowever, some might argue that refusing to give family gifts could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if there's a family tradition. But since the author was pressured after the gift card was found out, it's more about the family's reaction to their sudden wealth rather than a pre-existing expectation. The author's explanation about the cousins being young and not seen often adds context to why they felt it wasn't necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to spend their money as they see fit. The family's pressure and the mom's reaction might be more at fault here. So the answer is B.\n"
