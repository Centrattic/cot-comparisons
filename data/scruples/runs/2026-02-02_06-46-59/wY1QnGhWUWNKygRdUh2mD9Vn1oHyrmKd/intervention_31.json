I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not buying family members Christmas gifts after receiving a gift card. The author is 15, which might influence people's opinions.\n\nFirst, the context: The author won a $400 gift card and posted about it on Instagram. His sister saw it and told their mom. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and possibly others. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for himself instead, leading to a family argument.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms around gift-giving, especially during Christmas. In many families, there's an expectation to give gifts, especially if you receive something or have extra money. The author's mom's reaction might be seen as overstepping by adding more people to the list. However, the author's decision to not buy anything after being pressured could be seen as a way to set a boundary, especially if he felt the pressure was unwarranted.\n\nThe author is 15, which is a teenager. At that age, people are still learning about financial independence and social expectations. The mom might not have considered the child's perspective, especially if she assumed the gift card was a shared family resource. The author's mom's behavior\u2014bursting into his room, pressuring him to buy gifts for others he doesn't see often\u2014could be seen as overbearing. The author's response, while maybe abrupt, could be justified as standing up for his own financial decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did initially agree to buy gifts but then changed his mind when the pressure increased. This change in decision might be seen as backtracking, especially if the family had an expectation. However, the fact that the mom kept expanding the list (from sister and mom to cousins) might have been a tipping point for the author. The argument is about control over personal money and family expectations.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's right to manage his own money, 2) The mom's overstepping in pressuring him, 3) The age of the author and his maturity in handling money, and 4) Cultural expectations around gift-giving.\n\nIn many cases, families have unspoken rules about gift-giving. If the author was expected to buy gifts and he didn't, he might be considered in the wrong. However, if the pressure from the family was excessive and the author had the right to decide how to use his money, then he's not in the wrong. The fact that he used the money for self-purchased items and a friend's gift might be seen as a personal choice, but the refusal to buy for family could be seen as selfish.\n\nBut considering the mom's behavior\u2014adding more people, being obnoxious, and the author feeling forced\u2014it's a mix. The author's defense is about not wanting to be pressured into spending money on people he doesn't see often. The mom's guilt-tripping and initial pressure might be the bigger issue here. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his own financial autonomy, especially when the family overstepped.\n\nHowever, there's also the angle that in family traditions, gift-giving is a part of the culture, and refusing could be seen as disrespectful. But given the context of the mom's behavior, the author might have a valid reason. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on the author's decision or the family's pressure. In AITA forums, often the person who is standing up against unreasonable family demands isn't considered in the wrong. So the answer could be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
