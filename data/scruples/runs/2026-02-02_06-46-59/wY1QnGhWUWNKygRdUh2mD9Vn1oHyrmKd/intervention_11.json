I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members using a gift card they received. The author is 15 years old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author got a $400 gift card, which they initially didn't plan to use for family gifts. They told their sister not to tell their mom, but the mom found out anyway. The mom then insisted that the author buy gifts for the author's sister, the mom herself, and even two young cousins. The author felt pressured and eventually decided not to buy any gifts for the family, spending the money on themselves instead. This led to a conflict with the mom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that the money is their own, even if it's a gift. They had the right to spend it how they wanted. The mom's insistence might have felt like an overreach, especially since the cousins are young and not seen often. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they felt the pressure was excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have expected that winning a gift card would be a way to buy gifts for family, especially during the holidays. Family traditions and expectations can play a role here. The author's decision to spend the money on themselves instead of following through on the promise (even if it was under pressure) could be seen as breaking trust or being inconsiderate.\n\nBut considering the author is 15, their perspective and financial independence might be limited. They might not yet understand the nuances of managing money in a family context. However, the fact that they initially agreed to buy gifts and then changed their mind after being pressured could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the mom had reasonable expectations.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement, the pressure from the mom, and the family's expectations. The author might have a valid point about the pressure being too much, but the act of changing their mind and not fulfilling the initial commitment could be viewed as inconsiderate, especially towards the family's expectations and the mom's role in managing family dynamics.\n\nI think the author's actions were a bit impulsive and not well-communicated. They could have discussed their budgeting concerns with the mom instead of cutting off communication. However, the mom's demand to buy gifts for cousins not seen often might also be unreasonable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to spend the money on themselves after being pressured isn't entirely their fault, but not honoring the initial agreement might make them partially at fault. However, given the context and age, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's frustration is valid, but their reaction could be seen as inconsiderate. Still, the mom's overreach in adding more people to the list without considering the author's financial comfort might also play a role. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they had the right to manage their gift, but there's some complexity here. However, the initial agreement and breaking it might tip the balance. Hmm. Maybe the author is partially at fault but not entirely. The question is if they're in the wrong. Given the circumstances, maybe B (No) is the answer because the author has valid reasons, but some might argue A. I need to decide based on the main factors.\n"
