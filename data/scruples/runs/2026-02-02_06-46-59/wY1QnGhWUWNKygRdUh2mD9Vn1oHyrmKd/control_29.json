I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the kid gets a $400 Target gift card, which they didn't plan to use for family gifts initially. But when their mom and sister find out, they start pressuring them to spend it on family members. The kid then decides to use the money for themselves and a friend instead, leading to a conflict with their mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author, which is 15. At that age, financial independence might not be a strong concept yet, but they are starting to have their own money. The gift card was a windfall, and the author didn't want to spend it on family because of the pressure they felt. \n\nThe mother's actions\u2014calling, pressuring, and being obnoxious\u2014might have been a factor in the kid's decision. The kid might feel that their money is their own, especially since they were given the gift card. However, in many families, there's an unspoken expectation to share gifts, especially during holidays. But that expectation isn't universal, and the way the mother handled it could be seen as overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid did initially agree to get gifts for mom and sister, then changed their mind after more pressure. The fact that they ignored calls and texts might come off as rude, but they were under pressure. Also, the cousins are young and not seen often, so the kid might not feel obligated to spend on them.\n\nThe key points here are the pressure from the family, the age of the kid, and the expectation vs. the kid's right to their own money. The kid's frustration is understandable, especially if the family was pushy. However, walking away from the situation without communication could be seen as immature, but the mother's behavior also contributed to the tension.\n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I have to weigh both sides. The kid had the right to use their money as they saw fit, especially if it was a personal gift. The family's pressure might have been excessive. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
