I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving Christmas gifts to their family members. The scenario is that the author, a 15-year-old, got a $400 Target gift card. They told their sister about it after posting on Instagram. Then their mom found out and insisted they buy gifts for the sister and themselves, which the author agreed to. But then the mom added two more cousins, and the author changed their mind, bought gifts for a friend instead and kept the rest for themselves. The mom got upset and yelled.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the age of the author. At 15, they might not have a lot of independence in financial decisions, especially if they're still under their parents' care. The mom's reaction could be seen as trying to manage family traditions or expectations. The author's frustration with their mom's \"greediness\" and the mom's insistence on buying for cousins they don't see often might be a conflict point. \n\nAlso, the author had initially agreed to buy gifts for the sister and mom but then the mom added more people. The author might feel pressured or that they're being taken advantage of. But is that a valid reason? In many families, there's an expectation to give gifts to close relatives. The author's age could mean they're not expected to have significant expenses, so maybe the mom thought $400 was a good opportunity to get gifts for multiple family members. \n\nThe author's actions include changing their mind after agreeing, which could be seen as not following through. However, the initial agreement was under pressure, and the mom added more people after the fact. The author might not have had a clear understanding of how much to spend or if they were supposed to keep the money private. \n\nThe key elements here are the expectations within the family, the author's autonomy over the gift card, and the communication between the author and their mom. The mom might have expected the gift card to be used for family gifts, while the author saw it as their own money. The author's decision to buy for a friend instead could be seen as a shift in priorities, but the mom's reaction is typical of parental expectations. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because they did agree to buy gifts for the sister and mom, then reneged. However, their mom's behavior was also pushy, adding more people and being obnoxious. The 15-year-old might not have the financial independence to make such decisions, and the mom's guilt-tripping could be a factor. But the initial agreement and the author's change of heart might make them responsible for the disappointment. So, the answer might be A, but there are nuances. Alternatively, if the gift card was their own money, maybe they're justified. But since they're a minor, maybe the mom had a right to expect some use for the family. Hmm.\n"
