I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze the situation more carefully.\n\nSo, the person is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They shared it on Instagram, and their sister saw it. The mom found out and asked for gifts for her and the sister. Then, the mom added cousins into the mix. The person decided not to buy gifts for everyone and spent the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the age is a factor. At 15, they might still be learning about social expectations and family dynamics. The mom might have expected family gift-giving as a tradition, especially during Christmas. But the person felt pressured when the mom kept adding more people and being \"obnoxious\" about it. They were conservative with money, so spending $400 on family might be a lot for a teenager.\n\nThe mom's behavior might be part of the issue. She took the gift card without being asked, then added more people to the list. The person felt like their money was being controlled, which is a valid concern. But the flip side is that in some families, buying gifts for immediate family is customary, and not doing so might be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nThe person's response was to not buy gifts and instead spend on themselves. While they have the right to spend their money as they wish, refusing to buy gifts without communicating clearly could hurt family feelings. The mom might feel that the teenager was being selfish, especially if they didn't discuss their refusal beforehand. The argument that the cousins are young and not often seen might be a valid reason to skip their gifts, but the mom still expected something.\n\nThe key points here are the family's expectations versus the teenager's right to manage their own money. The mom's overstepping by checking the gift card and adding more people could contribute to the teenager's frustration. However, the teenager could have communicated their decision more clearly instead of just going ahead and spending the money. The mom might feel that the teenager was being disrespectful by not fulfilling the gift-giving expectation without a conversation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The teenager has a point about the pressure and control over their money, but they also might be in the wrong for not explaining their decision to the family beforehand, leading to hurt feelings. The mom's behavior was probably part of the problem, but the teenager's reaction might have been abrupt.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on cultural norms and family traditions. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think there's a mix. But given that they have the right to their money and the mom's behavior was part of the issue, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because not buying gifts without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
