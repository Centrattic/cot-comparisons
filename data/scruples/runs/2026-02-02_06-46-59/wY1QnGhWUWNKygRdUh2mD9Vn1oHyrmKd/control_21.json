I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called, asked who gave it, but the author told her not to tell their mom. Then the mom found out anyway, asked for the gift card, and started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the sister, mom, and even two cousins (ages 6 and 2). The author felt this was unreasonable, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen. They refused, bought themselves stuff instead, and got into an argument with the mom. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's think about the author's actions. The author received a gift card, which is their personal money, even if it's a gift. They didn't have to share it. The mom and sister, however, might have expected some sharing, given the way the mom reacted by calling and making demands. But the author felt pressured and decided not to buy gifts. \n\nAt 15, the author is a minor, so they might not be expected to handle money independently. However, the key issue here is whether the author was wrong to refuse to buy gifts for their family. The parents might feel entitled to some of the gift card money, but the author might feel that it's their money to use as they see fit. \n\nThe mom's reaction seems to be the root of the conflict. She took the gift card, which could be seen as overstepping, and then added more expectations. The author's frustration comes from the pressure and the mom's greed, as they mentioned in their statement. The author is also young, so their perspective might be that they're being unfairly controlled.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to share gifts, but the extent can vary. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish, but considering the mom's initial overreaction and demands, the author might have felt justified. Also, the cousins are young, so spending a lot on them might not be necessary. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author has the right to their money and can choose how to spend it. On the other hand, there's the social expectation of sharing with family, especially if the gift card was a stroke of luck they didn't expect. However, the mom's behavior seems to have escalated things by making demands after already taking the gift card. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs after that might be seen as a reaction to the mom's pressure, which could mitigate the blame. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were pressured unfairly and made a choice based on their own priorities after being treated obnoxiously. Their age also plays a role, as they might be learning to assert their independence. The mom's actions were more at fault, so the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing up for themselves.\n"
