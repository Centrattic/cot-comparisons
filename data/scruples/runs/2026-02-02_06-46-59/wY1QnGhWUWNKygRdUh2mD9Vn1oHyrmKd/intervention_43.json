I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old who got a $400 gift card and then refused to spend it on family gifts. \n\nFirst, the kid won the gift card and posted about it on Instagram. His sister saw it, and the mom found out. The mom then insisted he buy gifts for the sister and cousins. The author felt pressured and ended up not buying any gifts, instead spending the money on himself. Then there was a fallout with the mom and sister.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom my perspective, the author is a teenager who has some money, and the family expected gifts. The mom added pressure by expanding the list to include cousins. The author's frustration might be justified because he felt coerced, especially after the mom took the gift card, saw it, and then added more people. The author might feel that his money was being controlled, especially since he's a minor. However, in some family traditions, giving gifts is important, and the author's refusal could be seen as disrespectful or selfish. \n\nBut considering the author's age and the fact that minors often have parents managing their finances, the mom's actions might have been overstepping. The author's decision to prioritize his own needs after the pressure might be reasonable. However, the way he handled it (ignoring calls and texts) could come off as rude. \n\nOn the other hand, if the family expects gift-giving, the author might have been expected to participate. But the pressure from the mom to buy gifts for cousins he doesn't see often could be excessive. The author's argument that the family was being greedy might have some merit here. \n\nI think the key points are the pressure from the mom, the author's age, and the cultural expectations around gift-giving. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the right for standing up to pressure, but maybe in the wrong for not following through on the initial agreement. However, since he had changed his mind after the mom kept adding people, his reasons are understandable. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the pressure from the family was significant, and the author has the right to decide how to spend his money, even if it's a gift. The mom's behavior might have contributed to the conflict. But some might argue A because he didn't follow through on the gifts. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
