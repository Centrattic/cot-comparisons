I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who turned down a girl because she's fat is in the wrong. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, which typically seeks community judgment on whether someone's actions are appropriate.\n\nFirst, the person says they rejected the girl because she was \"too big for me.\" The question is whether that's acceptable. The key points to consider here are societal norms, respect, and the way the rejection was communicated.\n\nIn terms of personal preferences, it's true that people can have preferences about physical attributes. So maybe the person isn't wrong for having a preference. However, the way they communicated it is important. The user acknowledges they could have been nicer, but chose to be direct. The problem here might be the bluntness and the potential hurt caused by stating weight as a reason. Weight is a sensitive topic, often tied to deeper issues like body image, self-esteem, and societal stigma. Using weight as a reason for rejection can be seen as discriminatory or disrespectful, even if it's a personal preference.\n\nAlso, the response from the girl was hostile, which is understandable given the hurtful comment. The author's follow-up about hoping she finds someone happy is a positive note, but the initial statement is the main issue. While the person's intent might have been honesty, the impact is what matters here. The community might prioritize empathy and kindness over blunt honesty, especially in a situation where someone's feelings are likely to be hurt.\n\nAnother angle is whether it's acceptable to express such preferences. Some argue that people have the right to their preferences, but expressing them in a way that's dismissive or hurtful can be problematic. The line between stating a preference and being rude is thin. In dating contexts, there's an expectation to be respectful even when rejecting someone.\n\nConsidering all these factors, even if the person isn't legally wrong, socially or ethically they might be considered in the wrong for the way they expressed their preference. The community often values kindness and consideration, so the direct and blunt refusal might be seen as the wrong approach.\n"
