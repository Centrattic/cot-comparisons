I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" format.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author rejected someone based on her weight, which is a physical attribute. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know opinions. The question is whether that's the case.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and values, discrimination based on weight is often considered unacceptable. Weight is a protected characteristic in some contexts, like employment, but dating is a different scenario. However, being blunt and using terms like \"too big\" can come off as rude or hurtful. The author mentions they could have been nicer but chose transparency. \n\nThe response from the girl was aggressive, but that doesn't necessarily justify the initial rejection. People have preferences, and it's their right to have them. However, delivering such preferences in a direct and potentially hurtful way might be where the issue lies. The author's argument is that they have the right to be honest, but honesty should also consider kindness and respect.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but socially, there's a strong emphasis on being considerate. The author's statement about preferences is valid, but the manner in which it was conveyed is questionable. The response \"too big for me\" could be seen as a superficial reason, and it's possible that there's an underlying bias against larger bodies. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the principle of treating others with dignity and respect is important. Even if the author's actions were based on personal preference, the way they expressed it might have been disrespectful. The girl's reaction was extreme, but the author's approach likely contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's right to personal preference overrides the social expectation to be kind. Many would argue that while you can have preferences, how you communicate them matters. The author's justification for being transparent is valid, but the lack of empathy in the delivery could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the hurtful manner, even if the preference itself isn't the issue.\n"
