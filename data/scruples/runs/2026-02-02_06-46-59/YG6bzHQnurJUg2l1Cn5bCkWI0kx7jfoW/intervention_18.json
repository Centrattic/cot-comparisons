I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author rejected a girl, stating she's too big for him. They were set up by a friend, and the girl reacted angrily. The author defends their honesty, saying they had the right to be upfront about their preferences.\n\nNow, ethical and social norms come into play. Weight is a sensitive topic. Even if it's a personal preference, being blunt about it can hurt someone's feelings. Society often frowns on discrimination based on size, so calling someone \"too big\" might be seen as derogatory or fat-shaming. The author's response was direct but maybe not empathetic enough. While honesty is valued, there's a way to be honest without being hurtful. The girl's anger is a reaction to feeling judged, which is valid. The author could have been kinder while still being honest. So, even if the author isn't legally wrong, socially they might be considered in the wrong for not being compassionate.\n"
