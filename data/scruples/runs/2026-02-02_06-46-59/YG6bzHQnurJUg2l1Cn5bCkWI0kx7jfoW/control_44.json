      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author who rejected a girl for being overweight is in the wrong. The question is about whether the person who said \"Too big for me\" is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author rejected someone based on their size, which is a personal preference. But is that acceptable? Well, society often encourages being honest about your preferences in dating, but there's also a sensitivity around body shaming. The girl lashed out, which is understandable given the comment, but the key is whether the author's statement was appropriate.\n\nThe author claims they were being transparent. However, using the term \"too big\" can be seen as focusing solely on physical appearance rather than any other qualities. While people have the right to their preferences, the way it's communicated matters. Saying \"too big\" without offering any other reasoning might come off as dismissive or hurtful. The user also mentions they could have been nicer, which implies they acknowledge the potential rudeness, even if they stood by their preference.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of such rejection. Body image issues are significant for many people, and a direct comment about someone's size can be particularly damaging. The author's response might contribute to negative self-esteem or feelings of rejection. Even if it's a personal preference, the manner of delivery can affect the other person deeply.\n\nBut on the flip side, people do have the right to choose their partners based on their preferences. The author didn't make a false promise or lead her on; they were upfront. However, the phrase \"too big\" is a bit blunt and lacks empathy. More compassionate phrasing could still be honest while being less hurtful. For example, saying they have a preference for certain body types without focusing solely on weight.\n\nAlso, considering the reaction from the girl, she said \"Fuck you and I hope you die,\" which is aggressive. But her reaction might stem from feeling judged or insulted by the comment. The author's response was to wish her happiness, which is a positive note, but the initial rejection might have been too harsh.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a growing emphasis on kindness and respect in all interactions, even when declining someone. While honesty is valued, it's often balanced with consideration for the other person's feelings. So, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for having a preference, the way they communicated it could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because the rejection was based on a physical trait in a way that was hurtful and lacked sensitivity, even if they were honest about their preference.\n"
