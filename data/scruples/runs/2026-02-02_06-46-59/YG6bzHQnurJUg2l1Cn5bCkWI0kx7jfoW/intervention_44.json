I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she's fat. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, so it's a real-life situation where people might have strong opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author rejected someone based on her weight, saying she's \"too big for me.\" The person got upset and responded harshly. The author admits they could have been nicer but justifies being honest about their preference.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and respect. Weight is a sensitive topic. While people have personal preferences, using physical attributes like weight as a reason for rejection can be seen as discriminatory. The author's directness might be seen as honest, but the way they phrased it is hurtful. The response from the girl was also negative, but that doesn't excuse the author's comment.\n\nAlso, the question is if the author is in the wrong. In terms of social expectations, being upfront about preferences is sometimes accepted, but when it's about weight, it's often frowned upon because it's a common target for bullying and bias. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially, they might be at fault for not being more considerate.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions it's a \"huge\" weight that the girl is, but weight doesn't determine health or worth. The author's comment reduces the person to their body size, which is a form of body shaming. Even if it's a personal preference, expressing it in a way that's blunt and dismissive can be harmful.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is within their right to have preferences and that the girl's response was uncalled for. But the key is whether the author's actions were wrong. The question is about being in the wrong, which can be a matter of opinion, but in this context, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the hurtful nature of the comment, despite the honesty.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The author's reasoning is based on personal preference, but the way they communicated it was unkind. Even though the author admits they could have been nicer, the core issue is that they used a physical characteristic as a reason, which is generally considered insensitive. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
