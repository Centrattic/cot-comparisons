I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) question. The author's reasoning is that they're being transparent about their preference, and they think it's justified to not sugarcoat their truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around this. People often have personal preferences when it comes to relationships, but when those preferences are based on characteristics like weight, it can be problematic. The key here is how the author communicated their rejection. They said \"Too big for me,\" which is a direct and potentially hurtful comment. Even if someone has a preference, expressing it in a way that is disrespectful or contributes to body shaming is usually frowned upon.\n\nThe girl's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the author's bluntness. It's important to be honest without being cruel. Could the author have been nicer? The user already acknowledges that, but the question is about whether they were wrong. The fact that the author felt compelled to state their preference without any consideration for the other person's feelings suggests a lack of empathy. Rejection in dating is common, but the way it's delivered matters. Using a direct jab about someone's weight, even if it's a \"preference,\" can be seen as insensitive.\n\nAlso, the term \"hugely overweight\" is a bit of a red flag. Labeling someone in such a negative way, even if they are, might not be necessary. The author's \"friend\" hooking them up with someone else based on weight could be part of the issue too. Maybe the friend was also body-shaming. But the main point is the author's response.\n\nIn many cases, people are encouraged to express their preferences without being discriminatory or hurtful. So, while the author isn't wrong for not wanting a relationship with her, the manner of rejection and the reasoning being based on weight (which is a protected trait in some contexts) could be problematic. The author's justification of transparency might be valid, but the delivery was not respectful, leading to the girl's angry response. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their communication was direct and potentially harmful without considering the impact on the other person.\n"
