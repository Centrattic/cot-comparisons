      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the user approached a girl who is described as \"hugely overweight\" (5'6\", ~325 lbs) and turned her down. The reason given was that she's \"too big for me.\" The girl reacted angrily, saying \"Fuck you and I hope you die,\" and the author responded with a kinder message hoping she finds happiness. The user acknowledges they could have been nicer but believes transparency is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms around body weight and how people perceive such issues. Weight is a sensitive topic, and using it as a reason for rejection can come off as harsh or discriminatory. Even though personal preferences are valid, expressing them in a way that might hurt someone's feelings can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe user says they were transparent, but maybe the way they communicated their preference wasn't the most respectful. Saying \"too big\" directly might be more offensive than necessary. People often expect a bit more tact, even when honesty is intended. Also, the girl's reaction, while extreme, might indicate that the comment struck a sensitive nerve, which is common when body weight is involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't forcing a relationship and is being honest about their own preferences. It's their right to have personal preferences. However, the way it's delivered and the potential for causing emotional harm might be the issue here. The key point is whether the method of communication was appropriate, not just the right to have the preference itself.\n\nIn many discussions about this type of scenario, people often argue that while preferences exist, it's important to avoid devaluing others. The phrase \"too big\" can be seen as focusing on the person's weight in a negative way, which might be hurtful. Even if the user isn't being malicious, the impact of the words matters.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user's main mistake might be in the delivery rather than the decision itself. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether their actions were socially acceptable or not. The user acknowledges they could have been nicer, which suggests they recognize some fault, but the community's perspective is needed here.\n\nI remember similar cases where people are advised to be honest but kind, avoiding direct insults. So, using \"too big\" as a reason without any cushioning might be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the way the rejection was handled was hurtful and could be considered inconsiderate, even if the reason is a personal preference.\n"
