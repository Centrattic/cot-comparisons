I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who turned down the girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person rejected a girl, called her \"too big,\" and she responded angrily. The author justifies it by saying they were being honest about their preference for non-fat people. They acknowledge they could have been nicer but believe transparency is important.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and values. Weight is a sensitive topic, and while people have preferences, how those preferences are communicated matters. Telling someone they're \"too big\" directly can be hurtful, even if it's the truth. There's a difference between having a personal preference and expressing it in a way that might be considered disrespectful or harmful.\n\nAlso, the response from the girl was aggressive, but the author's approach might have contributed to that. Being blunt without empathy can come off as cruel. The author's reasoning is based on honesty, but honesty doesn't excuse potential harm. The key here is balancing honesty with kindness. \n\nIn many discussions about discrimination, weight is often considered a protected trait in some contexts, though not always in dating. However, the way the rejection was phrased could be seen as discriminatory. The author is allowed to have preferences, but expressing them as a reason for rejection might not be the right approach. There's also the aspect of respect\u2014treating someone with dignity even when declining their interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing a relationship, so there's an argument they have the right to their preferences. However, the method of communication is crucial. The response could have been more compassionate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being honest versus being inconsiderate.\n\nI think the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the hurtful phrasing and lack of empathy, even if the underlying reason is a personal preference. So the answer would be A.\n"
