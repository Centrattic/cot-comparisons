I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they told the girl they found her \"too big,\" which led to her getting angry. The author justifies being honest about their preference for non-fat people. \n\nNow, I have to think about social norms and ethics here. Being straightforward is sometimes seen as good, but the way it's delivered matters. The author admits they could have been nicer, but their reasoning is based on personal preference. However, fatphobia is a societal issue, and making a comment about someone's weight can be hurtful and discriminatory. \n\nThe key points are: the author's honesty vs. the potential harm caused by their comment. Even if it's their preference, is it acceptable to express it so bluntly? Also, the response from the girl was aggressive, but that might be because of the hurtful comment. \n\nIn many modern perspectives, body shaming is discouraged. People have different preferences, but expressing them in a way that's respectful is important. The author's approach was direct but not kind, which might be seen as rude or hurtful. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for having a preference, the way they communicated it could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because the author's method of rejection was hurtful, even if their intent was honesty.\n"
