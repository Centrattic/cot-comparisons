      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they turned down a girl because she was fat, and they were pretty direct about it. The girl was a friend's attempt to set them up, and when he said she was \"too big for me,\" she got angry and said some harsh things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being asked if they're the asshole for rejecting someone based on their weight. The key points here are the reasons for rejection and how it was communicated. \n\nWeight is a personal preference, right? People do have different preferences when it comes to romantic partners. But is it okay to express that preference in a direct way like \"too big\"? The problem here is that weight is often a sensitive topic. Even if it's a personal preference, saying it outright like that can be hurtful. Especially if the girl wasn't expecting that reason. Maybe she was hopeful, and being turned down in that way could be really damaging to her self-esteem.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they could have been nicer but chose to be transparent. But being honest doesn't mean you have to be blunt or hurtful. There's a balance between honesty and kindness. The response from the girl was angry, which might be a reaction to feeling judged or rejected in a way that wasn't respectful.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while people do have preferences, weight is a protected class in some places, and discrimination based on weight can be considered a form of bias. But I think this is more about personal choices rather than legal issues. However, from a social standpoint, being clear about a preference without being insulting is important. The way it's delivered matters a lot here.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend tried to set them up, so maybe the girl had some expectations. If the author was upfront, maybe they were trying to avoid leading her on. But even so, there's a more considerate way to say no. For example, saying they're not interested without giving a specific reason, or if asked, explaining it's a personal preference without using a term like \"too big,\" which can be dehumanizing.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they have the right to their preference. But acting on that preference by being direct in a hurtful way might cross a line. The key is whether the method was respectful. The girl's reaction shows that the message was received as offensive, leading to a hostile response. The author's attempt to be truthful was perhaps at the expense of being kind, which is a common issue in these situations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't malicious for having a preference, the way they communicated it was likely hurtful and inconsiderate, which makes them the asshole here. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
