I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who turned down a girl for being fat is in the wrong. The situation is presented in a Reddit-style question where the author is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author states they rejected someone because she was \"too big,\" which is a direct reference to her weight. The key issue here is whether it's acceptable to reject someone based on their body size. \n\nSocietal norms and anti-discrimination values come into play here. Weight is a protected class in some contexts, like employment or housing, but not always in personal relationships. However, even in personal matters, there's a cultural shift towards being more inclusive and respectful. \n\nThe author mentions they could have been nicer but chose to be honest. The response from the girl was hostile, which the author acknowledges. But the question is about whether the author's actions were wrong. \n\nOn one hand, people have the right to their preferences in dating. On the other hand, making a blanket statement that someone is unsuitable due to their weight can be seen as contributing to body shaming, which is harmful. \n\nThe author's justification is based on personal preference, but there's a difference between having a preference and expressing it in a way that's hurtful. Even if it's a personal choice, the manner of delivery and the language used might be considered derogatory. Words like \"too big for me\" can carry negative connotations, implying that the person's size is a problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nAdditionally, the girl's reaction was aggressive, which might have been influenced by feeling belittled. The author's response was to wish her happiness, which is a positive step, but it doesn't negate the initial hurtful comment.\n\nConsidering all this, even if the author's intention was to be honest, the act of rejecting someone based on their weight in a direct and unkind manner could be seen as wrong because it reinforces negative stereotypes and can be emotionally damaging. The key point is whether the author's actions were respectful and considerate, which they seem not to be. So, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
