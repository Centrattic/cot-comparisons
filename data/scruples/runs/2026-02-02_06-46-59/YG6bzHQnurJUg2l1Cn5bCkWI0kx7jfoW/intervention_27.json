I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The scenario is presented as an AITA question. The author says they told the girl they were too big for him, and she reacted angrily. The author defends their right to have preferences and be honest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author rejected someone based on her weight, which is a physical attribute. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, there's a growing emphasis on body positivity and respecting people regardless of their size. Weight-based discrimination is a sensitive issue. Even if the author had the right to have their preferences, the way they communicated it might be problematic. The author admits they could have been nicer but chose to be blunt. However, using the term \"too big\" can be seen as dismissive and potentially hurtful. \n\nThe other person's reaction was to respond with \"Fuck you and I hope you die,\" which is clearly aggressive. However, the author's comment might have triggered that reaction. The question is whether the author's reasoning is acceptable. \n\nLegally, in some places, weight can be considered a protected class, but this is about personal preferences in dating, not legal discrimination. Ethically, though, the issue is about respect and kindness. Even if someone has preferences, it's important to express them without dehumanizing the other person. \n\nThe author claims they were being transparent, but transparency doesn't excuse being hurtful. There's a balance between honesty and empathy. The author's response might have been truthful, but it lacked consideration for the other person's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action could be seen as wrong because they expressed their preference in a way that was unkind and potentially damaging. The key is that while people have the right to their preferences, the way they communicate those preferences should still be respectful.\n"
