I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented in a \"Am I the Asshole?\" style, so the user wants to know if the author's actions were justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author rejects someone based on their weight, which is a sensitive topic. Weight can be a personal issue, and comments about it can be hurtful. The author was direct but maybe not kind. The response from the girl was hostile, but that's not unexpected given the situation.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and how to deliver a rejection. While it's true that people have preferences and can be honest about them, the way it's communicated matters. Saying \"too big for me\" is a blunt way to express that, which can come off as judgmental. The author mentions they could have been nicer, but still defends their right to be transparent.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, body shaming is generally frowned upon. Weight is a common target for discrimination and it's often considered impolite to reject someone solely based on their size without considering other factors. However, the author isn't making a negative comment about her health or behavior; they're stating a personal preference.\n\nBut even personal preferences should be communicated with some level of empathy. The author's reasoning is that they have the right to their preference, but the harshness of the delivery can be seen as inconsiderate. The girl's reaction, while extreme, might be a result of feeling disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, people have the right to their preferences, but on the other, how you express those preferences matters. The author could have phrased it more kindly. The question is whether being direct without kindness is wrong. In social contexts, being respectful and empathetic is usually expected, even when rejecting someone. Therefore, the author's approach might be considered inconsiderate, even if their intention wasn't malicious.\n"
