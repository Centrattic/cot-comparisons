I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who turned down a girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The situation is posted as an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question. The author says they directly told the girl they found her too big, and the girl responded angrily. The author acknowledges they could have been nicer but believes honesty was necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and how such rejections are typically viewed. Fat-shaming is generally frowned upon, and making someone feel bad about their body can be hurtful. Even if someone is being honest about their preferences, the way they communicate that can matter a lot. The author's response was direct and possibly hurtful, which might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the key question here is whether the author's right to their preference outweighs the potential harm caused. People do have personal preferences when it comes to relationships, but expressing those in a way that's not considerate can be problematic. The author didn't sugarcoat it, which might be seen as lacking empathy. \n\nAnother angle is the girl's reaction. She got angry and said something harsh, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's comments. People have different thresholds for how they handle rejection, and the author's bluntness might have contributed to her emotional response.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. However, in this case, the author's reasoning is based on a preference for non-fat people, which can be seen as discriminatory. While it's true that people can have preferences, stating them in a way that targets someone's body size is often considered rude or even offensive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized honesty over kindness, potentially causing emotional harm. The right approach would involve being honest but also compassionate, perhaps finding a way to communicate the preference without shaming the person for their weight.\n"
