      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is that the author was set up with a girl who is overweight, and he directly told her he's not interested because she's too big. She responded angrily, and he said he hopes she finds someone happy. The author admits he could have been nicer but believes being transparent is the right approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values around body size and personal preferences. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making someone feel rejected based on their body can be hurtful. Even if someone has personal preferences, expressing that in a direct and potentially offensive way might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe author mentions that he felt it was justified to be honest. However, honesty doesn't have to come at the expense of kindness. The way the rejection was phrased\u2014\"Too big for me\"\u2014might be considered a body-shaming comment. It's important to consider the impact on the other person. The girl's reaction was to say \"Fuck you and I hope you die,\" which is extreme, but her emotional response might reflect the hurt from the rejection.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should evaluate if the author's actions meet the standard of being inconsiderate or offensive. While it's true that people have preferences in partners, using weight as a reason for rejection can be seen as discriminatory, especially when it's the sole reason. The author's approach lacks empathy and could contribute to the stigma around larger bodies.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forced to date anyone, so he has the right to his preferences. However, how he communicates that preference matters. There's a difference between having a preference and expressing it in a way that's hurtful. The author could have been more tactful even while being honest.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't committing a crime or violating a strict rule, his approach is likely inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because of the manner in which he conveyed his preference.\n"
