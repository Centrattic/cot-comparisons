I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who turned down a girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole\" context, so the community usually judges based on social norms and respect.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the reason for rejection. The author cited the girl's weight as the reason. Weight is a personal preference, but when it's used as a basis for rejection, especially in a dating context, it can be seen as discriminatory. People often criticize others for being rude when they're honest about their preferences, especially if it's considered a superficial or harmful trait.\n\nThe author did admit they could have been nicer, but still defended their right to be honest. However, the way they expressed it\u2014\"Too big for me\"\u2014might come off as insensitive. The girl's reaction was extreme, but her anger might stem from feeling judged or stigmatized. Weight is a common target for body shaming, and the author's comment could reinforce negative stereotypes.\n\nIn many \"AITA\" cases, the consensus is that while people have the right to their preferences, expressing them in a hurtful way, especially when asked for the reason, often leads to being on the \"asshole\" side. The author's transparency might be seen as justified in their own mind, but the impact on the other person matters. The line between honesty and cruelty is thin here. Since the author's reason is based on a preference that can contribute to body shaming, and they didn't consider the emotional impact, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong).\n"
