I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The key points here are the reasons given and the manner in which it was communicated.\n\nFirst, the author states they turned down the girl because she's \"too big for me.\" That's a direct reference to her weight. Now, weight can be a personal preference, but when it's used to reject someone, especially in a dating context, it can come off as discriminatory. The author admits to not being the nicest, but argues that honesty is important. However, the way the rejection was handled seems harsh and potentially hurtful. The girl's response was aggressive (\"Fuck you and I hope you die\"), which is extreme, but the author's comment might have contributed to that reaction.\n\nThe author's justification is about being transparent. But in social interactions, especially when dealing with someone's self-esteem issues, being \"honest\" shouldn't come at the expense of causing emotional harm. There's a difference between stating a preference and being disrespectful. The author's comment focuses solely on the woman's weight, which can be seen as a negative trait, rather than expressing that they're not interested for personal reasons without specifying the reason in a way that's hurtful.\n\nAlso, societal issues around body image play a role here. Many people, especially women, struggle with weight-related stigma. The author's comment could reinforce those negative feelings. Even if the author believes it's their right to have preferences, the way they communicated it lacks empathy. There's no mention of considering the other person's feelings or finding a kinder way to say no.\n\nThe author's follow-up of wishing the girl happiness is a positive gesture, but the initial rejection's harshness overshadows that. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. While they had the right not to pursue a relationship, the method of expression was problematic. So, from a moral standpoint, the author is in the wrong because they prioritized being honest over being kind, leading to a hurtful interaction.\n"
