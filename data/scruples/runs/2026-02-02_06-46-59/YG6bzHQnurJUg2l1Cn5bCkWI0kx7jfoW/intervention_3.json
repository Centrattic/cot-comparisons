      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author was set up with a girl who's described as \"hugely overweight\" (5'6\", ~325 lbs). He turned her down by saying she's \"too big for me.\" The girl got angry and said some harsh things back. The author admits he could have been nicer but believes he was being honest about his preferences.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether this was wrong. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was being honest about their preferences. It's true that people have different preferences when it comes to physical attributes. However, the way he communicated his rejection might be an issue. He used the term \"too big,\" which could be seen as focusing on her weight, which is a sensitive and potentially derogatory topic. Weight can be a sign of health, but also it's a common target for body shaming.\n\nEven though he was upfront and didn't sugarcoat it, the statement \"too big for me\" might come across as rejecting her based on appearance, which could be hurtful. The girl's reaction was aggressive, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right. The key here is whether it's acceptable to be honest about such a preference in the context of rejecting someone.\n\nIn some perspectives, it's okay for someone to have preferences and communicate them, as long as it's done respectfully. The author could have been more sensitive in his phrasing. For example, instead of saying \"too big,\" maybe he could have said something like \"I think we might not be a good fit for each other.\" But he chose to be direct.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of body positivity. Telling someone they're too big for you, especially when their weight is a significant factor, can contribute to societal issues around body shaming. Even if it's a personal preference, the way it's phrased can be hurtful and reinforce negative stereotypes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not obligated to date someone they're not interested in. It's their right to state their preferences. The problem might be more about the phrasing and the lack of sensitivity rather than the content itself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that the rejection was based on a personal preference but delivered in a way that is dismissive and potentially hurtful without any attempt to soften the blow, then maybe yes. The author's justification is that he was being transparent, but transparency doesn't always require being blunt in a way that can cause harm.\n\nIn some communities, being open about such preferences is seen as acceptable, but in others, it's considered rude or offensive. The girl's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't negate the possibility that the author's approach was inappropriate. The key might be the intent and the impact. Even if the intent was to be honest, the impact was hurtful.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, I think the author is in the wrong for how he delivered his rejection. While it's okay to have preferences, the way he communicated them was lacking in empathy and respect. Therefore, the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
