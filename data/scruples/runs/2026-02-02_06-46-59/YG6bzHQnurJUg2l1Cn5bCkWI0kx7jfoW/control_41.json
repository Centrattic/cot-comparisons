I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for turning down someone because she was overweight. The key points here are the method he used to reject her and the justification he gave.\n\nFirst, the author explicitly said, \"Too big for me,\" which is a direct reference to her weight. Even though he claims it's his personal preference, using someone's size as a reason for rejection can be seen as discriminatory. Weight is a protected category in many contexts, though not always in dating. But the way he phrased it is very blunt and could be hurtful.\n\nHe mentions that he could have been nicer, but he chose to be transparent. However, being honest doesn't mean being disrespectful. The response from the girl was aggressive, but that might be a reaction to the hurtful comment. The author's follow-up of \"I hope you find someone that makes you happy\" is a bit better, but it doesn't undo the initial hurt.\n\nThe question is whether it's acceptable to be so direct with such a reason. While people have preferences, stating a reason based on physical appearance in a way that's clearly derogatory is often seen as inconsiderate. The line between honesty and cruelty is thin here. The author's justification that he's \"allowed\" to have preferences is valid, but the manner in which he communicated it is problematic. It's about balancing honesty with empathy. So, even if the reason is personal, the way it's delivered can make the person responsible for the hurt.\n"
