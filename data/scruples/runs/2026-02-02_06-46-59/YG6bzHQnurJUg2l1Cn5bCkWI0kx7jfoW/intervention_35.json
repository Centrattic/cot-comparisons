      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down someone because they were fat. The situation is that the author rejected a girl who is \"hugely overweight\" (5'6\", ~325 lbs) by saying she's \"too big for me.\" The girl responded angrily, and the author claims he was being transparent about his preference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered acceptable behavior in such scenarios. People often have preferences in potential partners, but expressing those in a respectful way is important. Using the term \"too big for me\" might be seen as focusing on her weight, which is a sensitive topic. Weight can be a protected class in many places, so making decisions based on it might be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe author mentioned that he could have been nicer but chose to be honest. However, being honest doesn't excuse being hurtful. The way he communicated his preference was direct and possibly harsh. Even if it's his right to have preferences, how he expressed them matters. The girl's reaction, while extreme, might be a result of feeling disrespected or judged.\n\nAlso, the context of the girl being a \"friend's friend\" might not require the same level of delicacy as a close friend, but it's still important to be considerate. The author's justification that he's allowed to have preferences is valid, but the method of conveying that preference could be questioned. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing emphasis on body positivity and avoiding weight-based discrimination. By explicitly stating that her weight is the reason, the author could be contributing to harmful attitudes. Even if he's not legally wrong, socially, there's a case to be made that his approach was inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he expressed his preference in a way that was hurtful and potentially discriminatory, even if his intention was to be honest.\n"
