I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is described as the author rejecting a friend's setup by saying she's \"too big for me,\" leading to an angry response from the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is being honest about their preference, but the way they delivered it might be an issue. The girl called them out, and the author's response was direct. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while people have the right to personal preferences, being blunt about weight can be seen as insensitive. Weight is a sensitive topic, and comments about it can perpetuate stigma. Even if the author is honest, the way they communicated their rejection could be hurtful. The girl's reaction might be a result of feeling disrespected or judged. \n\nHowever, the author did mention they could have been nicer, which shows some awareness. They argue that being transparent is the right thing. But honesty doesn't always excuse hurtful language. There's a balance between honesty and kindness. In dating situations, preferences can be valid, but the delivery matters. Saying someone is \"too big\" is a direct and negative statement that can be damaging.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) often hinges on whether the action was unnecessarily hurtful. Here, the action of rejecting someone based on their size is within their rights, but the manner of rejection could be seen as rude. The community might debate this, but generally, being more compassionate is advised even when declining someone.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's reasoning is about personal preference, but the way they expressed it was likely unkind. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong for not being more considerate in their rejection.\n"
