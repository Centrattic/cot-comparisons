I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person rejected a girl because she was fat, and the girl reacted angrily. The author justifies it by saying they're allowed to have preferences and be honest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms around body weight and discrimination. In many places, weight is a protected category under anti-discrimination laws, though this can vary. However, in personal interactions like dating, it might not be the same as employment or housing, but there's still a social expectation of respect.\n\nThe author was upfront, but did they have the right to be so direct? The response \"Too big for me\" could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. While it's true that people have preferences, expressing them in a way that makes someone feel devalued is problematic. The girl's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't excuse the author's words. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they could have been nicer. Even if they believe they're justified, the way they communicated their preference was harsh. There's a difference between having a preference and expressing it in a respectful manner. The key here is whether the rejection was based on a valid reason or if it was discriminatory. Since weight is a personal attribute, but using it as a reason to reject someone can be seen as body-shaming, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nIn some contexts, people are advised to avoid making judgments based on appearance, but it's a personal choice. However, the impact of such statements can be hurtful. The author might not be legally in the wrong, but socially, they may have acted inappropriately. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which is more about social judgment here. So probably, the answer is A because the way they expressed their preference was hurtful, even if they meant to be honest.\n"
