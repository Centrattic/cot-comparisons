I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author turning down a girl because she's overweight, stating their preference directly, and the girl reacting angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author was honest about their preference, which they acknowledge might not have been the nicest approach. But they argue that they have the right to their preference and being transparent is the right thing to do.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and respect. Weight is a sensitive topic, and commenting on someone's size can be hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, the way they communicated their preference could be seen as disrespectful. The girl's reaction is also a factor\u2014she felt hurt and responded angrily, which might indicate that the approach wasn't considerate enough.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of personal choice versus hurtful behavior. While people have the right to their preferences, how they express those preferences matters. The author's response was direct but might lack empathy. The girl's size isn't the issue; the issue is the way the author communicated their rejection. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole). In similar situations, people are often advised to consider the other person's feelings and choose their words carefully, even when declining. The author's statement was blunt and focused on physical appearance, which could be hurtful regardless of intention.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the right to one's preferences versus the potential harm caused by how those preferences are expressed. The key here is whether the author's response was unnecessarily hurtful. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because while they had the right to their preference, the way they conveyed it lacked compassion and could be considered disrespectful.\n"
