I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) who pretends to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's grandfather is described as having harmful views, and the family is similar. The author disagrees but pretends to agree to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin was, and to secure inheritance. They feel conflicted but see it as a necessary evil until they can get the money.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about moral compromise versus self-preservation. The author isn't actively spreading hate but is complicit by silence and agreement. They're not in a position to challenge the grandfather's views without losing their inheritance or being cut off. They're also looking at the grandfather as a \"pinata\" for money, which adds a self-serving motive.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, there's a conflict between personal integrity and practical survival. The author's actions don't directly harm others since they're not participating in the harmful behavior, just avoiding it. However, their silence could be seen as tacit approval of the grandfather's worldview, which is problematic. But they're not actively endorsing it; they're just not opposing it for self-preservation.\n\nSocietal norms often judge passive complicity differently than active participation. The author isn't spreading hate but is complicit by not speaking out. However, in this context, their motivation is to protect themselves from being cut off and to inherit money. The cousin's experience shows the family's intolerance for dissent, making the author's position risky.\n\nThere's also the aspect of inheritance. The grandfather's wealth was earned through his own actions, possibly including harmful behaviors. The author is using that wealth without condoning the grandfather's views. But does that make them complicit in the grandfather's legacy? Or is it about their own moral stance?\n\nIn terms of the question's options, A is \"yes, in the wrong,\" and B is \"no.\" The key is whether the author's actions are morally wrong. Since they're not actively participating in the harmful behavior and are acting out of self-interest in a hostile environment, it's a gray area. However, the act of pretending to agree with harmful views for personal gain could be seen as ethically questionable because it allows the harmful environment to persist without challenge. \n\nBut considering the risk of being cut off and losing the inheritance, the author might be making a pragmatic choice. Their intention isn't to support the views but to survive the situation. The fact that they \"secretly hate them all\" suggests their true beliefs are opposed. So, while they're complicit by silence, their intent is not to endorse the views but to protect themselves.\n\nDifferent ethical frameworks would approach this differently. Utilitarianism might argue that if their actions lead to a greater good (like eventually using the inheritance for positive purposes), it's justified. Deontological ethics would focus on the duty to oppose wrongdoing, regardless of consequences, which might condemn the author's inaction. Virtue ethics would look at the character; the author is acting out of self-preservation, which isn't virtuous but isn't the worst vice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are ethically ambiguous. They're not actively wrongdoing but are complicit. However, given the context of a hostile family environment and the risk of being cut off, their choice might be seen as a pragmatic survival strategy rather than a moral failure. But the complicity is a factor. However, since the author isn't acting on their beliefs and is merely avoiding conflict for self-interest, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong. But some might argue that any complicity in enabling harmful views is wrong. I think the answer is A (yes), but I'm a bit torn. Let me double-check.\n"
