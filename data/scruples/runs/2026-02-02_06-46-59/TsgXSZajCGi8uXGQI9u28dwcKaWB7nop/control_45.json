I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the author is complicit by staying silent and nodding along. The family has a history of this kind of behavior, and the cousin who spoke up was ostracized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author isn't just passively disagreeing but actively pretending to agree. This is about moral compromise versus self-interest. On one hand, the author is enabling harmful ideologies by not challenging them, even if they personally disagree. On the other, they're in a family setting where speaking up has consequences, like being ostracized or losing inheritance.\n\nInheriting money is a financial incentive, but is it ethical to feign agreement with deplorable views to get it? The author is choosing to prioritize their financial gain over standing up against hate speech. Even though the cousin was ostracized, the author's decision to stay silent might perpetuate the cycle of harmful behavior. \n\nHowever, the author is also in a vulnerable position, possibly afraid of losing the inheritance or being cut off from the family. The question is whether the ends (getting the inheritance) justify the means (pretending to agree with harmful views). \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, lying for personal gain, especially when it involves complicity in bigotry, is considered wrong. The author is not just avoiding confrontation but actively deceiving their grandfather, which could be seen as a moral failing. The fact that they feel conflicted (hating themselves part of the time) suggests internal conflict, but doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the grandfather and family. By not challenging the views, the author might be reinforcing the grandfather's harmful beliefs, even if they don't agree. The inheritance is tied to someone who has a history of bigotry, so benefiting from that could be seen as complicity. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is not directly causing harm beyond their own hypocrisy. They're not spreading the views themselves, just staying silent. The cousin was ostracized for speaking up, so the author's decision might be a survival tactic in a toxic environment. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is choosing to pretend to agree, which is a form of active complicity through silence. Ethically, complicity in hate speech, even if it's not vocalized, can be considered wrong. The author is prioritizing personal gain over moral integrity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is complex and the author's fear of consequences is understandable, the act of pretending to agree with racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance is ethically problematic. The author is in the wrong because they are choosing to deceive and enable harmful ideologies for personal benefit.\n"
