I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is complicit by not confronting harmful views, which they find deplorable. They do this to avoid being ostracized and to maintain their inheritance. The cousin was already ostracized for speaking up, so the author might be in a tough spot due to family dynamics.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't actively spreading the hate but is staying silent. They're not engaging in the harmful behaviors themselves, just nodding along. They also express personal dislike for their family's views and feel conflicted. This might show that their intentions aren't malicious, but they're prioritizing self-interest over moral action.\n\nOn the other hand, enabling or complicity in hate speech can be problematic. By not challenging the grandfather, they might be allowing the harmful environment to continue. Even if they don't agree, their silence could be seen as acceptance. However, the risk of losing inheritance and being ostracized adds context to their decision.\n\nThe question is whether their actions make them an asshole. The key factors are intent and the balance between self-preservation and moral responsibility. Since they don't act on the views and only pretend to agree for personal gain, some might argue they're not in the wrong. Others might say complicity is still wrong regardless of the reason.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Considering that they don't actively participate in the harmful actions and are under threat of losing support and inheritance, maybe the answer is B. But the complicity aspect is tricky. However, the author is not spreading the views but just avoiding conflict. Their moral stance is clear; they hate the views but can't risk their safety or financial future. So, perhaps they are not in the wrong.\n"
