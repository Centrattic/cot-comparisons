I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, using slurs frequently. The family is also mentioned to be similar. The cousin who called them out was ostracized. The author keeps quiet, pretending to agree, and is focused on getting the inheritance. The main question is whether the author is an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, the author isn't actually holding those views but pretends to agree. They're motivated by fear of ostracism and desire for inheritance. They feel conflicted but justify it by the imminent death of the grandfather. The key points are the deception and the moral compromise for personal gain.\n\nNow, considering ethics. Deception is often frowned upon, especially if it involves lying about one's beliefs. However, people sometimes lie to avoid harm. In this case, the author isn't causing direct harm but is complicit in harmful ideologies. There's a tension between self-interest and moral integrity.\n\nInheriting wealth from someone with such views might also raise questions about the ethical use of that money. But the author's actions here are about securing the inheritance, not how they'd use it. The hypocrisy is clear\u2014they hate the views but feign agreement to get money.\n\nLegal and moral aspects differ. Legally, there's no wrongdoing since inheritance isn't tied to expressing views. Morally, it's about personal ethics. The author is prioritizing self-interest over standing up for their beliefs. The cousin's experience shows the consequences of speaking out, which adds context about family dynamics.\n\nIs pretending to agree to avoid being kicked out and losing the inheritance wrong? Arguably, yes, because they're enabling harmful behavior through silence and deception. But if their alternative was to be cut off immediately, the decision becomes more about survival or security. The author's self-hatred suggests they know it's wrong on some level.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the ends justify the means. Since the author's actions don't directly cause harm (they're not acting on the grandfather's views) but involve complicity and hypocrisy, many might see it as morally compromising. However, others might argue it's a pragmatic choice given the circumstances.\n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, typically, people are criticized for complicity in harmful behavior, even if it's passive. The act of pretending to hold those views could be seen as a form of enabling, which is ethically problematic. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, the pressure from family and fear of ostracism might mitigate some blame. \n\nBut since the question is about being an asshole, the key is whether the author's actions are wrong in a moral sense. Pretending to agree with harmful ideologies for personal gain, despite personally disapproving, is likely considered morally wrong. The self-interest is clear, and the author isn't taking a stand against the harmful beliefs they despise. Therefore, the answer is probably A (Yes).\n"
