I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The grandfather is a racist, homophobic person, and the family is like that too. The author disagrees but pretends to agree to avoid being ostracized like their cousin and to get the inheritance. The cousin who spoke up was punished, so the author is trying to stay quiet.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the arguments, the author is complicit by not confronting the grandfather's harmful views. But they have a reason: fear of being kicked out and losing the inheritance. The author is conflicted, hating themselves for it but also seeing it as a way to survive until the money is theirs. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting or pretending to support racism and homophobia is bad. The author isn't just staying silent but is actively nodding along, which could be seen as endorsement. Even if they don't believe it, their actions might enable the grandfather's behavior. However, the context includes fear of family rejection and financial loss, which complicates things.\n\nBut the problem is that by agreeing, they might be perpetuating those views, even if passively. The cousin's experience shows that speaking out leads to punishment, which makes the author's position risky. However, the author is choosing to sacrifice their integrity for personal gain. \n\nOn the other hand, people might argue that the author is making a pragmatic choice in a difficult family dynamic. They aren't directly causing harm, just not stopping it. But complicity in harmful speech can still be considered wrong. \n\nI think the consensus here is that while the situation is complex, the author is complicit in enabling harmful views by not speaking up. Pretending to agree for personal gain, especially involving money, adds to the moral dilemma. So the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
