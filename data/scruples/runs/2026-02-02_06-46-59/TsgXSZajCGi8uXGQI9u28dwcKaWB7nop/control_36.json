I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person's grandfather is described as racist and homophobic, and the family is largely similar. The author doesn't share these views but pretends to agree during family gatherings to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin was, and to secure their inheritance. They feel conflicted but practical, seeing their grandfather's poor health as a countdown to getting the money.\n\nSo, the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is not actively promoting harmful views but is complicit by staying silent and nodding along. They are using that silence to gain a financial benefit from a family member with harmful beliefs. \n\nEthically, there's a conflict between personal gain and moral integrity. The author isn't acting on their beliefs, but by staying silent, they are allowing harmful ideologies to go unchallenged. This could be seen as complicity. However, they might argue that they are not causing direct harm beyond their personal ethics. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking advantage of someone's prejudice for personal gain, which could be considered morally wrong. On the other hand, they are not actively participating in hate speech or actions, just avoiding confrontation. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so the author's choice to stay silent might be a survival strategy in a hostile environment.\n\nBut the fact remains that they are using their grandfather's prejudiced views to their advantage. This could be seen as exploiting the situation for selfish reasons. However, the author isn't spreading the hate; they're just not opposing it. It's a gray area. \n\nLegally, there's no issue because pretending to agree isn't illegal. Morally, though, it's questionable. The author is prioritizing their inheritance over challenging bigotry, which some might see as wrong. Others might argue that in a hostile environment, self-preservation is necessary.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, people often judge based on intent and action. The author's intent is to avoid conflict and gain financially, but their actions don't involve direct harm beyond their own inaction. However, complicity in harmful ideologies can be considered problematic, even if passive.\n\nI think the consensus might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they are complicit and benefitting from the grandfather's prejudices. However, some might argue that the author isn't directly causing harm and is in a difficult position. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A because exploiting someone's harmful beliefs for personal gain is ethically questionable.\n"
