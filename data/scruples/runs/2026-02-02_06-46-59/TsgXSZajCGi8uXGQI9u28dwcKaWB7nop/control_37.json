I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as having a history of using slurs and harmful stereotypes. The author is uncomfortable but doesn't speak up because their cousin was ostracized for challenging the grandfather before. The author's main motivations are to avoid being kicked out of the family and to get the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about moral responsibility. The author isn't actively participating in harmful actions but is complicit by staying silent and feigning agreement. They're using manipulation for personal gain, which can be seen as unethical. However, they're also in a difficult position, facing family ostracism and loss of inheritance if they speak out.\n\nMoral philosophy might offer different perspectives. From a deontological viewpoint, lying or being complicit in harmful views is wrong regardless of consequences. From a utilitarian perspective, if the author's actions prevent immediate harm (like being kicked out) and the inheritance could be beneficial later, maybe it's justified. But complicity in racism and homophobia is a serious ethical issue. Even if the author doesn't share the views, their silence and feigned agreement allow the grandfather's harmful attitudes to persist, which could contribute to a toxic environment for others.\n\nThe fact that the cousin was ostracized for speaking up adds complexity. The author might feel they have no other option, but that doesn't necessarily excuse their actions. They're choosing personal gain over moral integrity. Also, using family members' prejudices for financial gain could be seen as exploiting the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not causing direct harm. They are not acting on the harmful views, just allowing them. But in terms of ethics, complicity is a form of participation. The author is enabling the grandfather's bigotry by not challenging it, which is morally problematic. The inheritance motive is self-serving, which can be seen as greedy, but it's a common human desire to secure one's future.\n\nSo considering all angles, the author is making a choice that prioritizes their financial interests over standing up against harmful ideologies. Even if the environment is hostile, the decision to feign agreement for personal gain might be considered ethically wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
