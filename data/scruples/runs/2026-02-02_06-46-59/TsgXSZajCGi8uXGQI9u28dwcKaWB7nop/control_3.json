I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The grandfather is described as having harmful views, and the author is feigning agreement to avoid conflict and ensure they get the inheritance. The cousin was ostracized for disagreeing, which adds to the pressure.\n\nThe key points are: the author's actions involve deception, complicity in harmful ideologies, and the motivation is self-interest. But is deception ethically wrong in this context? The author isn't acting on the views, just pretending to agree. However, by not challenging the grandfather, they might be enabling harmful behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position, facing potential loss of inheritance and family rejection. The cousin's experience shows the consequences of speaking out. So, the author's choice could be seen as a survival tactic rather than malicious intent.\n\nBut ethically, pretending to hold racist views, even if they don't, could be considered complicity. It might contribute to the grandfather's sense of validation, which is harmful. However, the author isn't directly causing harm beyond their own actions. \n\nIn terms of the inheritance, the author is using the grandfather's death for personal gain, which could be viewed as self-serving, but not necessarily unethical if the inheritance is legally theirs. The moral dilemma is between personal gain and ethical integrity.\n\nConsidering all angles, while the author's actions involve deception and complicity, the context of family dynamics and the risk involved might mitigate the ethical judgment. However, the act of pretending to agree with harmful views for personal gain is generally seen as morally questionable. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
