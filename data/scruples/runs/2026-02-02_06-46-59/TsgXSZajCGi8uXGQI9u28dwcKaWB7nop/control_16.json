I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe person (AITA) is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to get inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist, homophobic person, and the family is similar. The cousin who called out their views was ostracized, so the author stays silent to avoid the same fate and to secure the inheritance. They feel conflicted but justify it by thinking the grandfather is near the end of his life, so they can tolerate it until the inheritance.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with harmful views to gain money. Let's consider the arguments for and against.\n\nFirst, the author's actions involve insincerity and complicity in harmful ideologies. By pretending to agree, they're not challenging the grandfather's views, which could contribute to the perpetuation of those harmful beliefs. Even if they don't personally endorse the views, their silence and nodding along might be seen as tacit approval, which could be harmful to others present, especially if others in the family are influenced by the grandfather's rhetoric.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult position. They are facing family pressure and a toxic environment. The cousin's experience shows that challenging these views leads to ostracism, which is a real concern. The author's decision to stay quiet might be a survival tactic, both emotionally and financially. Also, the inheritance could be a significant financial resource for them, and they might be planning to use it for their own well-being or future.\n\nBut ethically, is it wrong to pretend to agree with something you fundamentally oppose for personal gain? Some might argue that it's a moral compromise, but others might see it as a practical decision under duress. The author isn't actively participating in harmful actions; they're just not opposing them. The question is whether passive complicity is equivalent to wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of inheritance. The grandfather's wealth is tied to his harmful beliefs. By accepting it, the author might be benefiting from someone else's bigotry. This could be seen as morally problematic, especially if the inheritance is used in a way that indirectly supports or perpetuates those views. However, if the author uses the money for positive purposes, maybe that's a different consideration.\n\nAlso, the author's self-hatred indicates they are aware of their actions' moral implications, which suggests internal conflict. But does that make it right? Not necessarily, but it shows they aren't indifferent.\n\nIn terms of societal ethics, there's a debate about whether one's actions should align with their values even in difficult situations. However, the reality is that people often have to make tough choices when facing family pressure or potential financial loss. The author's situation isn't straightforward.\n\nI think the key factors here are the author's intent and the impact. They don't support the views and are actively opposing them internally. The main action is the pretense to secure inheritance. If we consider that pretending to agree isn't an action that causes direct harm (since they aren't acting on the views), but the silence might enable the grandfather's harmful speech, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in many ethical frameworks, complicity in harmful ideologies, even passive, is considered wrong. So the author might be in the wrong for not challenging the views, even if it's for self-preservation.\n\nBut given the context of potential ostracism and financial loss, it's a complex situation. The answer might hinge on whether the author is considered complicit in the grandfather's harmful views by not speaking out, which could be seen as supporting them by default. Alternatively, since they aren't actively participating, it's a lesser form of complicity.\n\nI think the consensus here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they are allowing harmful views to go unchallenged for personal gain. Even if they don't agree, their silence and agreement can be seen as enabling the grandfather's behavior. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
