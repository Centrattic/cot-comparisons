I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're an asshole for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views just to get their inheritance. Hmm. The grandfather is described as really bigoted, using slurs frequently. The person doesn't share those views but keeps quiet to avoid being ostracized, like what happened to their cousin. They also want to secure the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the grandfather's views are clearly harmful and offensive. The author is complicit by not speaking out, but they have reasons: fear of being kicked out and losing the inheritance. They hate the views but suppress their feelings for self-preservation and financial gain.\n\nBut is pretending to agree with racist and homophobic ideas inherently wrong? Well, even if you don't voice your disagreement for safety, is staying silent and faking agreement a moral failing? The author isn't acting on the harmful views, just avoiding confrontation. However, by not challenging the grandfather, they might be enabling the behavior. But the author is in a vulnerable position, especially if the family dynamics are toxic.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the ends justify the means. The author wants the inheritance, which is their right, but the method involves complicity in harmful ideologies. But they aren't actually holding those views; they're just not vocalizing their opposition. Is passive complicity the same as being in the wrong? It's a gray area. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't actively participating in harm beyond silence. They're not promoting the views, just not opposing them. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so the environment is hostile to any dissent. The author's self-preservation is understandable. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of looking at the grandfather as a \"pinata\" for money. That might be seen as exploiting the grandfather's death for financial gain, which could be morally questionable. However, inheritance is typically a family matter, and the author is entitled to it by birthright in many cases. So, maybe that part isn't the problem.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, some might say that the author is wrong because they're compromising their values for money. Others might argue that they're in a difficult position and doing what they can to survive the family dynamics without being harmed. The key point is that the author isn't acting on the harmful views, just not opposing them. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether silence in the face of wrongdoing is considered complicity. In some ethical frameworks, that is the case. However, in a toxic family environment where speaking out leads to ostracization, the situation is more complex. The author's intentions are also important\u2014they don't agree and feel hatred for the views. They are not endorsing them, just not challenging them actively. \n\nSo, considering all factors, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, there's a part where they are complicit by silence, but given the circumstances, it's a tough call. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Given that they are not actively participating and are in a hostile environment, perhaps B is the answer. But I'm not sure. Different people might have different takes here. The key is whether pretending to agree is wrong when you don't hold those views, especially for self-preservation and inheritance. If the law or strict ethics say that complicity is wrong, then A. But if it's about personal moral conflict and survival, B. I'm leaning towards B.\n"
