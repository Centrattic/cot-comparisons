I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the author is part of a family with similar views. The author doesn't share these views and is critical of them but stays silent to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin was. The main goal is to inherit money, and they're conflicted about faking agreement to achieve it.\n\nNow, considering ethics. The author isn't directly acting on harmful beliefs; they're pretending. But they're benefiting from someone else's bigotry. Is that wrong? Well, enabling or benefiting from harmful ideologies can be problematic. However, the author isn't promoting those views, just not opposing them. On the other hand, they're being pragmatic, protecting their own interests in a hostile environment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of self-preservation. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so maybe the author is avoiding a hostile family situation. But using that as a justification for complicity in racism and homophobia is a gray area. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. The grandfather has the right to his views and to leave his inheritance as he wishes. But morally, the question is whether the author is complicit by staying silent. The author isn't actively harming anyone else but is allowing their grandfather's harmful beliefs to go unchallenged for personal gain. \n\nHowever, if the author is being hypocritical by not standing up for their values, that could be seen as a personal failure. But the alternative is risking losing the inheritance and being ostracized, which is a tough choice. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't acting on their grandfather's views; they're just not opposing them. They have their own beliefs but are staying silent for self-interest. That's not necessarily being in the wrong, especially if there's a risk of retaliation. But some might argue that benefiting from someone's harmful beliefs, even indirectly, is morally wrong. \n\nOn balance, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they are complicit by not challenging the harmful views. However, others might say it's about personal choice and survival in a toxic family environment. The answer might depend on the ethical framework used\u2014utilitarian vs. deontological. \n\nBut given the options, I need to decide. If the question is whether the author is an asshole, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a practical choice to protect themselves and their future, even if it means enduring personal conflict. The grandfather is the one with the harmful views, not the author. The author isn't acting out of malice but self-interest. So maybe B is the right answer.\n"
