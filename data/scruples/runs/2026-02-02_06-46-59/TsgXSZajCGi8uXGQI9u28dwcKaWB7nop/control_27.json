I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether pretending to agree with a grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance makes someone an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is in a family where the grandfather and many relatives hold harmful, prejudiced views. The author doesn't share these views but pretends to agree to avoid conflict and ensure they get the inheritance. The cousin who spoke out was ostracized, so the author keeps quiet. The main conflict is between maintaining personal integrity and getting the inheritance.\n\nNow, the author is being hypocritical, right? They don't believe the things they're agreeing with but say they do. Hypocrisy is generally seen as negative, especially when it involves harmful ideologies. But maybe there's a justification here. The author isn't actively perpetuating the views; they're just not speaking out against them. However, by remaining silent, they might be complicit in a way, even if they don't agree. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is acting out of self-interest. They want the inheritance, which is a personal goal. But is it wrong to prioritize their own financial future by not challenging a harmful family member? The cousin was punished for speaking up, so the author's silence might be a survival strategy in a toxic environment.\n\nIs there a moral obligation to speak out against racism and homophobia, even if it risks losing money? Some might argue that standing up for what's right is more important than material gain. Others might say that in a family setting, especially with power imbalances, the priority is safety and practicality.\n\nAlso, considering the grandfather's health, the author might be in a race against time. They're not benefiting from the views themselves but avoiding the negative consequences of disagreeing. The question is whether the ends (getting the inheritance) justify the means (pretending to agree with harmful views).\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author's own values. By pretending to agree, they might be compromising their integrity, which can have psychological effects. But maybe in this case, the author is making a calculated choice to protect their interests without directly causing harm beyond their own silence.\n\nIn legal terms, there's no wrongdoing, but morally, it's a gray area. The author isn't actively causing harm, but they're not actively opposing it either. The key issue is whether silence in the face of prejudice is considered complicity, which can be seen as a moral failure.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are a moral compromise. If the author is in a position where speaking out could lead to ostracization or loss of inheritance, their choice might be pragmatic. However, the hypocrisy and complicity might still make them an asshole, depending on the ethical standpoint.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. Pretending to agree with harmful views for personal gain can be seen as morally wrong, even if it's for self-preservation. The right thing would be to oppose those views, even at a personal cost. But given the context of the cousin's experience, the author's fear is understandable. Still, from a moral perspective, the author's silence might be considered complicity, thus making them an asshole.\n"
