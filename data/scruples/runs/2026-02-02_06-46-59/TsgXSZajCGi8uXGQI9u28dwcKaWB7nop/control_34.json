I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again. They're asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person who uses slurs a lot. The writer doesn't share these views and secretly hates their family for it, but they stay quiet because their cousin was ostracized for speaking out. The main reasons they give for staying silent are to avoid being kicked out of the family and to keep the inheritance, which they see as a way to eventually get the money when the grandfather dies.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The person is not acting according to their own beliefs but is pretending to agree with harmful views. They acknowledge that this makes them uncomfortable, but they do it for self-interest. The question is whether this makes them an asshole. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between self-preservation and honesty. The person isn't directly harming others by staying silent; they're not spreading the same slurs. However, they're complicit by not challenging the harmful views. But there's also the aspect of family dynamics and the fear of being ostracized, which is a real concern. The cousin was already punished for speaking out, so the environment is hostile towards dissent.\n\nOn one hand, the person is using a manipulative strategy to gain financial benefit from someone whose values they find abhorrent. That could be seen as exploiting the grandfather, even if the grandfather is the one with problematic views. On the other hand, they aren't actively spreading the hate, just staying quiet. They might feel trapped by the family's dynamics and the threat of losing the inheritance, which is a significant financial stake. \n\nI need to consider societal norms. Pretending to agree with racist and homophobic views is generally frowned upon because it can enable harmful behavior. However, the context here is complex. The person isn't part of the problem in the same way as their grandfather or family members; they're just not speaking out. But their silence could be seen as complicity. \n\nThere's also the aspect of moral responsibility. If they have the opportunity to challenge the grandfather's views without direct confrontation, maybe they should find another way. But given the cousin's experience, confrontation isn't safe. So they're choosing self-preservation over moral action, which is a tough spot. \n\nAnother angle is the inheritance. The grandfather earned the money, so the person has a claim to it. But is it right to take money from someone whose values you despise? Some might argue that the money isn't earned through good deeds, so taking it could be seen as benefiting from someone's bad actions. Others might say that it's the person's right to inherit regardless of the grandfather's views. \n\nI should also think about the psychological impact. The person is experiencing internal conflict and guilt, which suggests they feel it's wrong. Their self-loathing for pretending indicates they know they're not acting in line with their values. That internal struggle is a sign that they see something wrong in their actions, even if they're justifying it for other reasons.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The person is in a difficult situation where they have to choose between their principles and self-interest. They're not actively spreading hate but are complicit by staying silent. They're using a strategy to gain from someone's wealth despite his harmful views. The question is whether this makes them an asshole. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, complicity in harmful behavior is considered wrong, even if not directly participating. However, the person's actions are also a form of self-preservation and financial security. Given that they genuinely hold opposing views and are conflicted, it's a nuanced case. But the act of pretending to agree with harmful ideologies for personal gain might be seen as exploitative, hence making them at fault. \n\nHowever, others might argue that the person isn't causing direct harm and is just trying to survive emotionally and financially. The cousin's experience shows the family's reaction to dissent, making it a hostile environment. So, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the question is about being an asshole, which often relates to how others perceive the action. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a strong argument that the person is in the wrong because they're enabling the grandfather's views by not challenging them, even if silently, and are using him for financial gain. But there's also a counterargument about the harsh family environment and the need for self-preservation. However, the act of exploiting someone's harmful views for personal benefit is likely considered wrong in the context of the AITA scenario, which usually leans towards honesty and integrity.\n"
