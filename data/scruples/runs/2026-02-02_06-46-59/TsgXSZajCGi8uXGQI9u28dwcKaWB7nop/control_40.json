I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about pretending to agree with a grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the author is pretending to agree to avoid conflict and maintain their inheritance. The cousin who called out the grandfather was ostracized. The author is conflicted but justifies it by the potential inheritance.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception, complicity in harmful beliefs, and self-interest. The author isn't actively opposing the grandfather's harmful views but is instead complicit by feigning agreement. Even though they don't hold these views, their silence might be enabling the grandfather's behavior. \n\nInheritance is a personal financial gain, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Morally, some might argue that the author is complicit by not challenging the views, even passively. Others might say that the author isn't acting on the harmful beliefs, just avoiding confrontation for practical reasons. But pretending to agree with such harmful views could be seen as morally wrong because it supports the status quo and allows the grandfather to continue without accountability.\n\nAlso, considering that the cousin was ostracized for speaking up, the author's silence might contribute to a toxic environment. The author's motivation is self-serving, which could make it worse. However, the author isn't directly causing harm beyond complicity. \n\nIn ethical terms, complicity can be a form of wrongdoing, especially when one has the chance to speak up but chooses not to for personal gain. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they are enabling harmful views by not challenging them, even if they don't personally hold them. But there's also the argument that they are not acting on those views, just avoiding conflict. \n\nI think the consensus here would be that pretending to agree with such harmful ideologies is morally wrong, even if the person doesn't believe them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
