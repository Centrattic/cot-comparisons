I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure their inheritance. The grandfather is described as using constant slurs, and the family is similar. The cousin who called them out was ostracized, so the author keeps quiet. They feel conflicted but are motivated by self-interest and fear of losing money.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the moral dilemma of condoning harmful beliefs versus self-preservation. The author isn't just silent; they're actively pretending to agree, which might be different from passive silence. They're complicit in a way by not challenging the harmful views, even if they don't voice their disagreement.\n\nInheriting money from someone who holds such views is another angle. The author is using the inheritance as a reward for not opposing their grandfather's harmful beliefs. That could be seen as a form of moral compromise. But is the author wrong for doing this? Well, they're not acting on the bad views, just allowing them to be expressed. However, by pretending to agree, they might be enabling the harmful environment.\n\nLegally, there's nothing wrong with inheriting money, but ethically, the question is about complicity. If someone is in a position to challenge harmful behavior but chooses not to for personal gain, is that unethical? Some might argue that the author isn't causing direct harm, just not preventing it. Others might say that by not speaking up, they're implicitly supporting the views, especially since they're in a family setting where their actions can influence others.\n\nThe cousin's experience shows that speaking out leads to ostracization, so the author's silence is also a form of self-preservation. But the question is whether self-preservation justifies complicity. The author isn't doing something bad themselves, but their inaction allows the grandfather's harmful views to continue unchecked. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not acting on those views. They are merely avoiding conflict for personal gain. Some might argue that the author's personal ethics remain intact, even if their actions are morally questionable. It's a balance between personal ethics and practicality.\n\nIn terms of societal standards, there's often a line between personal gain and moral integrity. If someone is in a position to make a stand but chooses not to for selfish reasons, many would see that as being in the wrong. However, the fear of losing inheritance and the potential consequences of speaking out add complexity.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is making a choice that prioritizes self-interest over challenging harmful beliefs. While they aren't acting on the beliefs themselves, their silence and pretense of agreement could be seen as complicity. Therefore, they might be considered in the wrong for using their grandfather's money as a reward for not opposing his harmful views, even if they don't personally hold those views.\n"
