I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to examine the situation. The grandfather is described as having offensive views, and the author is part of a family that tolerates this behavior. The cousin who spoke out was ostracized, so the author keeps quiet to avoid the same fate and to get the inheritance. \n\nThe author is complicit by not challenging the harmful views. Even though they don't hold these beliefs and feel guilty, their silence and feigned agreement might be seen as enabling the grandfather's behavior. But they also have a financial motive, which complicates things. \n\nEthically, is it wrong to pretend to agree with something you fundamentally oppose for personal gain? Some might argue that the author is being pragmatic, taking a realistic approach in a hostile environment. Others might say that by not speaking out, they're complicit in perpetuating harmful ideologies. \n\nThere's also the aspect of family pressure and potential ostracization. The author's fear of losing the inheritance and being kicked out adds a layer of coercion. However, the inheritance is tied to someone's harmful legacy, which raises questions about accepting money from such sources.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the author isn't actively spreading the hate, their inaction in the face of it could be seen as a problem. But given the family dynamics and the consequence of speaking out, it's a tough situation. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, pretending to agree with harmful views is ethically questionable. On the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position, possibly facing real consequences if they don't. The financial incentive complicates the moral judgment. \n\nIn the end, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their actions (or inaction) support a harmful system, even if out of self-preservation. However, the context of the family's behavior and the cousin's experience must be taken into account. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer likely is A (Yes).\n"
