I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The grandfather is described as racist and homophobic, and the author is not in agreement but pretends to be to avoid losing inheritance. The cousin was ostracized for disagreeing, so the author keeps quiet. \n\nOn one hand, the author is complicit in not challenging harmful views. They're enabling the grandfather's behavior by not speaking out, which could be seen as morally wrong. Pretending to agree with such views, even if for self-interest, might perpetuate the grandfather's harmful beliefs and allow him to continue without accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult position. They might feel that their actions are a form of self-preservation, given the family dynamics and the risk of losing inheritance. Inheritance is a financial matter, and the author might see it as a way to secure their future. But does that justify complicity in hate?\n\nEthically, many would argue that one should not enable or condone harmful behavior, even if it's for personal gain. Silence in the face of hatred can be seen as complicity. The author is using their grandfather's money, which was likely acquired through systems that may also benefit from the same prejudices they're pretending to endorse. There's a conflict between personal benefit and moral integrity here.\n\nHowever, the practical aspect is that the author is in a family where challenging these views has real consequences, like ostracization. The cousin's experience shows that there's a risk involved. The author might feel trapped between their values and their financial security.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of pretending to agree with racist and homophobic views to get money is ethically problematic. It's about choosing personal gain over standing up for what they believe is right. Even if the author isn't actively causing harm, their silence and feigned agreement can contribute to a hostile environment and normalize harmful attitudes. \n\nIn this context, the author might be considered in the wrong because they are prioritizing financial gain over confronting and opposing the grandfather's harmful beliefs. It's a personal choice that has moral implications, and while understandable given the circumstances, it doesn't absolve them of ethical responsibility.\n"
