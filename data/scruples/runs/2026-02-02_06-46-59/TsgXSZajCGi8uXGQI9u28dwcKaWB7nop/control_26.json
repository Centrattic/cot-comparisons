I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as using slurs regularly, and the family is similar. The cousin who called out the grandfather got ostracized.\n\nSo the user is keeping quiet, smiling and nodding when the grandfather makes offensive remarks. They feel bad about it but justify it by saying the grandfather's health is failing, and they want the inheritance. The main question is whether the author is an asshole for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethics. The user is complicit by not challenging the harmful statements. Even if they don't share the views, by staying silent and pretending to agree, they're allowing the harmful environment to continue. That could be seen as complicity in the perpetuation of racism and homophobia. \n\nOn the other hand, they might be in a vulnerable position, fearing ostracism or losing out on inheritance. The cousin was ostracized, so there's a risk involved in speaking up. However, ethical principles often emphasize the importance of standing against injustice even when there are personal costs.\n\nBut the user's motivation is self-serving\u2014they want the inheritance. That might affect how their actions are judged. If someone is acting out of self-interest without regard for the harm caused by their silence, that's a point in favor of them being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the concept of moral responsibility applies here. Even if you're not directly causing harm, enabling or not challenging it can be morally problematic. The user's silence allows the grandfather to continue harmful behavior without any accountability.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user isn't directly causing harm but is avoiding conflict to survive in a toxic family dynamic. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the consequences of speaking out.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often criticize those who benefit from harmful systems or individuals without speaking out. The user is benefiting from the grandfather's wealth while allowing him to continue spreading hate. This duality is likely seen as ethically wrong.\n\nSo, weighing the options, the user's actions are complicit in maintaining a harmful worldview, even if they don't agree. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
