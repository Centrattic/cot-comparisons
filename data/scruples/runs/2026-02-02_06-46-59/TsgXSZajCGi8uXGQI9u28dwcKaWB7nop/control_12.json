I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical principles. The grandfather is clearly acting unkindly and holding harmful beliefs. The author is not endorsing those views but is pretending to agree to avoid conflict and secure financial gain. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't acting on the grandfather's beliefs\u2014just nodding along. They're not harming anyone by keeping quiet, especially since speaking up has led to ostracization before. The inheritance is part of the grandfather's estate, which he can leave as he chooses. The author's actions are a personal choice to avoid conflict and gain something they might not otherwise have.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that pretending to hold racist views is morally wrong. But the author isn't actually holding those views; they're just not expressing their disagreement. There's a difference between complicity and active participation. The author isn't promoting the views, just avoiding confrontation.\n\nAlso, considering the situation's context: the cousin was ostracized for speaking up, so the risk for the author is real. The inheritance is a financial incentive, and the author is using it as motivation to endure a difficult family environment. It's a pragmatic choice rather than a moral endorsement.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. Some might say that not taking a stand against racism and homophobia is wrong, but others might argue that the author is not enabling harm beyond passive agreement. Since the author isn't acting on those beliefs or causing direct harm, their actions might be seen as self-preservation rather than active wrongdoing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions may be uncomfortable, they are not necessarily in the wrong. They are navigating a difficult family dynamic and personal ethics to achieve a personal goal without actively perpetuating harm.\n"
