I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The grandfather is described as having harmful views, and the author is complicit by not challenging them, even though they personally disagree. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so the author stays silent to avoid the same fate and to maintain their inheritance position.\n\nThe key points here are about moral responsibility. The author is not actively supporting the views but is passively complicit by staying silent. There's a conflict between personal ethics and self-preservation. The author's actions might be seen as hypocritical, but they're also trying to avoid harm to themselves. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that by not speaking out, the author is enabling the grandfather's harmful behavior. However, others might understand the practical dilemma of facing social exclusion or losing financial security. The intention behind the author's actions is crucial here. They are seeking inheritance, which could be seen as exploiting the grandfather's views for personal gain. \n\nBut is this enough to say they're in the wrong? The author isn't causing direct harm, just not acting against it. There's a debate here between individual responsibility and moral compromise in the face of familial pressure. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer would depend on whether passively benefiting from someone's harmful views without active support is considered wrong. If the author is using deceit (pretending to agree) to gain an inheritance, that could be seen as unethical. However, if the inheritance is automatically theirs by line of succession regardless of opinions, maybe not. The author is using dishonesty to maintain their position, which is a form of manipulation. \n\nSo, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they are actively deceiving someone they dislike and using it for personal gain, even if they don't agree with the views. The deceit part is key here.\n"
