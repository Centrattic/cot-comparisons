I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. They have to fake agreement to avoid being ostracized and to get the money.\n\nFirst, the grandfather's behavior is definitely problematic. The user isn't in agreement with those views but keeps quiet because of fear of being kicked out and losing the inheritance. Their cousin was ostracized for calling out the grandfather, so the user is in a difficult position.\n\nNow, the question is whether pretending to agree is wrong. On one hand, the user isn't actually holding those views, so they're not being hypocritical in action. They're just feigning agreement to protect themselves and their inheritance. On the other hand, is there a moral obligation to stand up for what's right even if it means losing out on money?\n\nThe user is self-aware; they hate their grandfather's views and feel guilty. The main motivation here is self-interest, which might make some people judge them as selfish. However, they're not actively promoting the views, just not challenging them. There's a line between complicity and active promotion. Since the user isn't speaking up, they might be seen as complicit to some extent, but not as being racist or homophobic themselves.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a tough call. The user is in a toxic environment where speaking up has consequences. They're making a choice to protect their own well-being and future. While it's not admirable to fake agreement, is it truly wrong? Some might argue that they're being pragmatic, while others might see it as a failure to uphold their values. The key factors here are the user's intent (not to agree, but to survive and inherit) versus the grandfather's actual harmful views. The user isn't causing harm directly; they're just not challenging it. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but opinions can vary based on cultural or personal beliefs about complicity.\n"
