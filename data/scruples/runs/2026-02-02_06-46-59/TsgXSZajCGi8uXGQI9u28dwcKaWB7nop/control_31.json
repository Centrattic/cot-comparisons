I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by reading through their question again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure inheritance. Their grandfather is described as a \"racist homophobic asshole\" who uses slurs frequently. The author doesn't share these views and secretly hates their family for it. However, they keep quiet because their cousin was ostracized for disagreeing with the grandfather. The author is staying silent to avoid being kicked out and to keep their inheritance, which they believe is only a year or two away. They're conflicted, feeling bad about pretending to be racist but also seeing the grandfather as a \"pinata\" that will eventually give them money.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. The author is complicit by not challenging harmful views, even if they don't actively agree. But they're not expressing their true views, which could be seen as being in the wrong by association. However, the motivation is to protect their inheritance and avoid ostracization. \n\nOn one hand, feigning agreement with racist and homophobic beliefs is deplorable because it allows harmful ideologies to persist and can be seen as enabling the person's behavior. Even if it's for personal gain, staying silent when such views are expressed can contribute to a toxic environment. The author is choosing their own benefit over standing up for what's right, which might make them an asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't actually acting on those beliefs. They are not perpetuating the harm beyond what's already happening. The cousin was ostracized for speaking up, which suggests the grandfather has significant power and influence in the family. The author might fear losing the inheritance, which is a financial security issue. In such a scenario, some might argue that the author is making a pragmatic choice to survive and secure their future, even if they feel conflicted. \n\nBut then again, pretending to agree, even in silence, could be seen as morally wrong. It's a form of dishonesty and might enable the grandfather's harmful actions. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for doing so. The key here is the act of pretending and the intent behind it. The author isn't actually promoting the views but is avoiding confrontation to get money. \n\nAnother angle: the cousin tried to speak up and was ostracized. The author is choosing not to risk their own position and inheritance. Is this self-preservation or cowardice? The line between the two is thin. If the family environment is abusive or harmful, maybe the author is in a difficult position. But the fact that they are okay with the grandfather's views for personal gain might still make them complicit.\n\nAlso, the inheritance is tied to someone's harmful legacy. The author is benefiting from someone's unethical behavior. Even if they don't act on the views themselves, taking the inheritance could be seen as profiting from the grandfather's beliefs. However, the inheritance is a financial matter, and the author isn't necessarily endorsing the views by accepting the money. The issue is more about the act of pretending to agree during interactions.\n\nSo, the main points are complicity through silence, enabling harmful views, and using the grandfather's money while pretending to share his beliefs. But the author isn't actually racist or homophobic, just not speaking up. In some views, moral responsibility is about not being a bystander. In others, it's about individual choice and consequences.\n\nI think the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they are allowing themselves to be complicit by not challenging the grandfather's harmful speech. Even if they don't voice their real opinions, staying silent in the face of such bigotry can be seen as morally wrong. The fact that they see the grandfather as a \"pinata\" for money adds a layer of selfishness. However, some people might argue that the author is prioritizing their own life and financial security over confronting an inconsiderate and possibly dangerous man, which could be a form of self-preservation. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Pretending to agree with such harmful views to get money is ethically questionable. The author is choosing to maintain a facade of agreement, which is a form of hypocrisy. Even if they don't actively participate, their silence and feigned agreement can be seen as tacit approval. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
