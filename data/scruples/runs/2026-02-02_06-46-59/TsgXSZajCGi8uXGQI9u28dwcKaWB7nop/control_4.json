I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author's grandfather is described as a bigoted person, and the family is similar. The author doesn't share these views but pretends to agree to avoid conflict and secure the inheritance. Their cousin was ostracized for calling out the grandfather, so the author stays quiet. They feel guilty but see it as a way to get money once the grandfather dies.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, the author is complicit by not speaking out against harmful views, even if it's for self-preservation. Silence in the face of racism and homophobia can be seen as tacit agreement or enabling harmful behavior. Also, using someone's prejudiced views to benefit oneself might be morally questionable, especially if it perpetuates those harmful ideologies.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position, facing potential ostracism or losing financial security. They might be acting out of self-interest and fear. The alternative of speaking out might lead to personal consequences, like being cut out of the inheritance, which could financially destabilize them. \n\nMoral philosophy can offer different viewpoints. Utilitarianism might look at the greater good\u2014if the author's actions prevent personal harm but don't actively cause widespread damage, it could be justified. Deontological ethics, which focuses on duties and rules, would argue that lying or being complicit in racism is wrong regardless of the consequences. \n\nAlso, the concept of integrity comes into play. The author feels guilt and self-loathing, indicating a conflict between their actions and their true beliefs. However, the question is whether they are objectively in the wrong, not just if they feel guilty.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility to oppose injustice. Even in difficult family dynamics, some ethical frameworks emphasize the importance of standing against hatred. However, practical considerations like personal safety and financial stability are significant factors.\n\nIn many cases, people in similar situations might be seen as acting out of self-preservation, which is understandable, but the complicity aspect complicates things. The author isn't actively spreading hate but is not challenging it either. \n\nI should also consider real-world examples and societal norms. Many people in toxic families keep quiet to protect themselves, but the act of staying silent when they could speak up is often criticized, even if it's for personal reasons. The inheritance aspect adds a material interest layer, which might make the situation more ethically fraught.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are understandable from a self-preservation standpoint, the complicity in harmful ideologies and the instrumentalization of another person's prejudice for personal gain likely places them in the wrong from an ethical perspective. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
