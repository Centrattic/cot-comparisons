I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is complicit in allowing harmful ideologies to be perpetuated by not confronting their grandfather. Even though they don't personally hold these views, their silence and feigned agreement might be enabling the grandfather's behavior. \n\nAlso, the author mentions looking at their grandfather as a \"pinata\" for money. That seems self-serving and uses a relationship based on family for personal gain. There's a moral question about whether it's acceptable to exploit a family member's death for financial benefit. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult situation. They're under pressure from a family patriarch who ostracizes people who speak out. The cousin's experience shows the risks of challenging the grandfather. The author might be acting out of self-preservation and fear of losing the inheritance, which could affect their future. \n\nEthically, some might argue that the author is wrong because they're not standing up against hate speech and are complicit by staying silent. Others might say they're making a pragmatic choice to survive in a hostile environment. \n\nBut the key point is the author's intent. They're not just avoiding confrontation; they're actively pretending to agree to gain something. That's a form of hypocrisy. While they don't endorse the views, their actions support the grandfather's harmful beliefs. \n\nIn terms of justice, the inheritance might be a contentious issue. If the grandfather's estate is part of a system that benefits from harmful ideologies, taking that inheritance could be seen as profiting from others' prejudice. However, the author might have a legal right to the inheritance regardless of their grandfather's views. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a tough spot, but ethically, their actions support the grandfather's harmful worldview by not challenging it. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong), but there's also a case for B given the context. But I think the consensus would be A because enabling hate speech through silence and hypocrisy is morally wrong, even if the motivation is self-interest.\n"
