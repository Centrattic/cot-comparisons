I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The grandfather is described as having harmful views, and the author is keeping quiet to avoid being ostracized like their cousin and to inherit money. The main issue here is the manipulation of one's beliefs for financial gain, even if the beliefs are the grandfather's.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't acting according to their true values. They are suppressing their beliefs, which can be seen as a form of hypocrisy. However, they are not actively promoting those views; they're just nodding along. The question is whether this pretense makes them complicit in the grandfather's harmful ideology. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is both self-preservation (to avoid being kicked out) and financial gain. It's a complex situation where personal ethics clash with practical needs. Some might argue that the author isn't wrong because they're not causing harm beyond their own silence. Others might say that by not challenging the views, they're enabling the grandfather's behavior.\n\nIn terms of moral philosophy, deontological ethics (like Kant's) would focus on the intentions. The author's intent is to secure inheritance, which might be seen as selfish, but they're not actively harming anyone. Utilitarian ethics would look at the outcomes. If the author's actions prevent harm (like being ostracized) and the grandfather's views remain unchanged regardless, maybe it's justified.\n\nHowever, the author's self-loathing suggests internal conflict. They recognize the wrongness of the views but feel trapped. This makes it a tough call. Legally, there's no wrongdoing in not expressing disapproval unless there's a duty to speak out, which isn't the case here. \n\nThe key is whether pretending to agree makes them complicit. Since they're not promoting the views but merely staying silent, maybe it's not their fault. But the question is about being an asshole, which is more about social morality. The author is using a derogatory term for their grandfather, which might imply they see him as unworthy, yet they benefit from his estate. This could be seen as morally contradictory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are ethically ambiguous, the fact that they are maintaining a harmful status quo without actively challenging it could be seen as wrong. The answer might lean towards A, as they are choosing personal gain over standing against harmful ideologies, even passively. But there's also a strong argument for B if considering self-preservation and lack of active harm.\n"
