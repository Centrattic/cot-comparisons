We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened several years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was unhappy with the meat's doneness, even though others were fine with it. The MIL later criticized the food in front of the husband, leading to the author vowing not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they are in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior seems harsh and unnecessary. She asked her husband if the meat was cooked, and after he said it was, she still refused to eat it and ended up re-cooking it. Then, instead of addressing the issue privately, she criticized the food in front of the husband, which hurt him. That part is clearly unkind and could have been handled better by the MIL. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response has been to cut off cooking for the MIL and FIL for six years. While the MIL's actions were inconsiderate, holding a grudge for such a long time could be seen as overly harsh. The author's husband is trying to move past it, and the author is being asked if they are in the wrong by not forgiving. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The MIL's behavior was rude and unappreciative. \n2. The author's punishment (not cooking for years) is a long time and might affect the relationship. \n3. The author's husband is trying to mend things, and the author is resisting. \n\nWhile the MIL is at fault for her actions, the author's prolonged refusal to cook might be seen as holding a grudge. The author's justification is that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism was especially hurtful. However, keeping a vow for six years might be disproportionate. The author could consider whether letting go would be healthier for the relationship and their own peace of mind, even if the MIL didn't apologize.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the person who is in the wrong is typically the one whose actions were more unkind or unreasonable. Here, the MIL was unkind, but the author's long-held grudge is also a point. However, since the author is the one asking if they're in the wrong, and the question is about their actions (not forgiving), the answer might hinge on whether holding a grudge for six years is unreasonable. \n\nGiven that the author's husband is trying to move on and the author is being asked to consider cooking again, the author might be in the wrong for maintaining a grudge without resolution. However, if the MIL never apologized, the author's stance could be justified. But since the author is the one not moving on, even though the MIL's actions were worse, the author might be the one in the wrong for not letting it go. So the answer is likely A.\n"
