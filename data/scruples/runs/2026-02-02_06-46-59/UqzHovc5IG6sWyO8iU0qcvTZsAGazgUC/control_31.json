We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, then later took it back to grill more. A few days later, the MIL criticized the food and blamed the husband, causing him emotional distress. The husband tried to confront her, but she didn't apologize. The author stopped cooking for the MIL after that, and now the husband wants to move on, possibly having the author cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe key points here are the MIL's behavior: criticizing the food publicly, making the husband feel bad, and not apologizing. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which they've done for six years. The husband is now pushing to move past this.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about forgiveness and holding a grudge. The author's stance is based on the MIL's unapologetic behavior and the husband's hurt. The author's vow to never cook again seems to be a self-imposed punishment to avoid similar situations. \n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't reached out to apologize. But on the other hand, the MIL's actions were hurtful and the author's response is a form of self-respect, avoiding conflict by not cooking. The author might feel justified because no one else criticized the food, and the MIL was the only one who made it personal. \n\nThe husband's request to move on could be about mending family relations, but the author is standing by their decision. The author's action (not cooking) hasn't hurt the MIL directly since they haven't noticed, but it's affecting the husband's desire to reconcile. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. Forgiveness is important, but so is setting boundaries. If the author feels that not cooking is their way of protecting themselves from future hurt, it's understandable. However, holding onto a grudge for so long might prevent healing. \n\nBut the key is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author's response was a personal choice to avoid conflict, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're maintaining boundaries. The answer would be B (No), because the author isn't at fault for holding onto the grudge when the MIL hasn't shown remorse.\n"
