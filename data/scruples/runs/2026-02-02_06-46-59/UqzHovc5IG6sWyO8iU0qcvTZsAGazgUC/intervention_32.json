We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation is about a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it. The author stopped cooking for them after her husband tried to address it and the MIL didn't apologize. Now, the husband wants to move on and have her cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key elements. The MIL's actions were unkind and publicly embarrassing, and she didn't apologize. The husband was hurt and tried to address it, but the MIL stood by her comments. The author made a vow not to cook for them again as a result. Now, the author is being asked if holding this grudge for six years is wrong.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. They want to know if that's correct. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should consider the context. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate. She criticized the food in front of others, took it upon herself to fix it, and then later complained about the food being bad and that she had to cook it herself. This was hurtful and ungrateful, especially since the family put effort into the cookout. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which might seem like holding a grudge. But the husband is asking her to move on now. \n\nThe question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. Factors to consider: the initial incident's severity, the MIL's lack of apology, the author's own feelings, and the potential impact on family relationships. If the author feels hurt and hasn't forgiven the MIL because of repeated unapologetic behavior, is that wrong? Or is it reasonable after the MIL's actions?\n\nAnother angle: the author might be protecting her husband's feelings by not cooking, as the husband was upset by the MIL's comments. Also, the husband is now pushing for reconciliation. The author's stance is that she won't cook for them, but others might not have noticed. The husband is okay with cooking if it's just grilling, but the author thinks he can't cook otherwise.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, sometimes holding onto past hurts can affect relationships. But if the other person has not shown remorse, it's harder to forgive. The author might feel justified in her actions. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive if there's no ongoing contact or harm.\n\nThe dilemma here is balancing personal feelings with family expectations. The author's decision to stop cooking is a way to set boundaries. But if the husband wants to move forward and the MIL hasn't changed, is it fair to expect the author to let go? Alternatively, maybe the author is justified in maintaining her stance because the MIL's actions were disrespectful.\n\nIn some perspectives, forgiveness is expected, but in others, protecting oneself from negative influences is necessary. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or personal values. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the analysis could go either way.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is a bit nuanced. If the MIL's actions were a one-time mistake, the author might be overreacting. But since the MIL defended her comments and showed no remorse, the author's continued refusal could be seen as justified. However, the length of time (six years) without reconciliation might be a point against the author. But if the author still feels hurt, it's understandable. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. Since the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the MIL's actions were unkind and unapologetic, the author's stance might not be entirely wrong. However, holding onto it for years could be seen as not moving on. So, there's a split here. But according to the initial analysis, maybe the author is in the right, but the question is whether the user's initial thought (author is wrong) is correct. However, based on the scenario, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the MIL's behavior was the root cause, and the author's response is a boundary set due to past hurt.\n"
