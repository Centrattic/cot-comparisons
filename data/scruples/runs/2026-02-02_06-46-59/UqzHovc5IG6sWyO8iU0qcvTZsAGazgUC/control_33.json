We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her FIL, who said it was cooked, then later grilled it herself. Days later, the MIL criticized the food, saying it was terrible and she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset and the author vowed not to cook for them again. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is hesitant.\n\nThe key points here are the MIL's actions: publicly criticizing the food and making her husband walk away. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband is pressuring them to cook for Easter.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding a grudge. Let's consider both sides. The MIL's behavior was hurtful and unkind, especially since no one else had issues with the food. The author's reaction is a personal choice to protect their feelings. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The husband's perspective is that they should move on, and the author is being stubborn. But if the author feels hurt, they have a right to set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice they haven't cooked, so maybe the resentment is more about the author's own feelings than the MIL's. The author's main issue is the public criticism and lack of apology, which is valid. The husband's desire for reconciliation is understandable, but the author's choice to not cook is their way of coping.\n\nIn terms of social norms, holding a grudge for such a long time could be seen as harsh. However, if the author hasn't been properly apologized to, they might feel justified. The key here is that the MIL didn't apologize and continued to be critical. The author's vow is a response to a hurtful action that wasn't rectified. So while it's a long time, the author isn't necessarily wrong if they still feel the sting of that incident.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because maintaining boundaries after a hurtful experience is valid. The author is prioritizing their emotional well-being, which is acceptable. The husband might not see the hurt in the same way, but the author's feelings are legitimate.\n"
