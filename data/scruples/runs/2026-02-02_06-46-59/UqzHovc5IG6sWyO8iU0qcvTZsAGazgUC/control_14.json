We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a cookout where the author's mother-in-law (MIL) didn't like the meat and ended up cooking it herself. Then later, the MIL criticized the food and the husband was upset. The author stopped cooking for them because of that and hasn't reconciled even after six years. Now the husband wants to move on and cook Easter dinner, but the author is hesitant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cookout was the husband's and author's DIY project. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then re-cooked it. Then the MIL went to the husband's workplace to complain, which upset him. The author then vowed not to cook for them again, which has lasted six years.\n\nIs the author wrong for holding a grudge? Well, the MIL's actions were pretty harsh. She not only criticized the food but did it in front of the husband at work, which is pretty unkind. The husband was hurt, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them. But holding a grudge for six years seems a long time. The author argues that no one else had issues with the food, just the MIL. Also, they mention that the relationship with the MIL is good otherwise except for this incident.\n\nThe husband now wants to move on. The author is being asked if they're at fault. On one hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. On the other hand, the MIL's actions were pretty disrespectful, and the author's husband was hurt. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a personal choice to protect their feelings, especially if the MIL didn't apologize.\n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? The husband wants to forgive and move on. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for not forgiving. If the MIL made a mistake and the husband has already addressed it, maybe the author should let it go. However, the author's decision not to cook is their choice, and unless they're harming others, it's their autonomy. The key here is whether the author's response is reasonable. Since the MIL didn't apologize, the author might feel justified. But the length of time is a factor. Six years is a long time without any interaction related to cooking. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions, the community often looks at intent, harm, and resolution. The MIL was in the wrong for the criticism. The author's punishment is to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. However, holding it for six years without any attempt at reconciliation might be seen as stubborn. But since the author hasn't done anything wrong except maybe holding a grudge, and the MIL was the one who started the conflict, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to be upset, and their choice to stop cooking is a personal boundary. The husband's push to move on is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to cook if they don't want to.\n"
