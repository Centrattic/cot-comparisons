We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout. \n\nSo the situation: The couple had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat, then later took it back to grill more. Then the MIL criticized the food at work, which upset the husband. The author decided not to cook for them again, which they've kept up for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, maybe for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of each party. The MIL's behavior seems harsh. She didn't just make a polite comment about the food but instead criticized the author publicly and privately, which led to the husband being hurt. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which is a long time. But is that justified?\n\nThe key points are the MIL's actions: she wasn't satisfied with the meat, then later publicly criticized the food, making the husband feel embarrassed. The author's response was to stop cooking for them. The question is whether holding a grudge for six years is wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, holding onto resentment for such a long time might not be healthy. The author's husband is pushing to move past it, and the author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise. The author might be punishing the MIL, but the MIL's actions weren't criminal, just hurtful. The author's vow could be seen as a reasonable boundary, especially if the MIL never apologized. But maybe the author is overreacting by not letting go after so long, even if the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author says they might not even notice the lack of cooking. So the author isn't harming them, just setting a boundary. The answer might hinge on whether the author's action is justified as a boundary or if it's an unnecessary grudge. Since the MIL never apologized, the author's stance could be seen as fair. But six years is a long time. However, in some cases, people do hold onto things because of repeated hurt. Here, it's a one-time incident, though it affected the husband deeply. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving. They have the right to set boundaries. However, the husband is asking to move on, so maybe the author should consider reconciliation. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are within their right to protect their feelings, then they aren't in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No). But some might argue it's holding a grudge, which is wrong. But given the MIL's actions, the author's response is a form of self-respect, so B makes sense."
