We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her FIL about the meat's doneness, then later grumbled about the food's quality and claimed she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author decided to stop cooking for the MIL and has kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move past it, and the author is conflicted.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **MIL's behavior**: She criticized the food publicly (though she did it to her son, not the author directly) and didn't apologize. That's unkind and could hurt the husband's feelings. The author's husband was clearly affected.\n\n2. **Author's response**: The author took a vow not to cook for the MIL anymore. Cooking for family can be a social norm, but the author's decision is personal. They mention that the MIL might not even notice the absence, which suggests the author isn't causing harm by not cooking.\n\n3. **Time passed**: Six years is a long time. The husband wants to move on, maybe to avoid further tension or to maintain family relations. But the author has personal reasons to hold the grudge.\n\n4. **Other relationships**: The author states that they otherwise have a good relationship with the MIL. The issue is isolated to this incident.\n\n5. **The husband's cooking skills**: The author mentions that the husband can't cook well except for grilling. So, the author isn't unwilling to cook, just for the MIL specifically.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as harsh, especially if the MIL hasn't acknowledged the wrongdoing. However, the author's feelings are valid because the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking again, and the MIL hasn't been affected. The husband's desire to move on is understandable, but it's his choice to reconcile, not necessarily the author's obligation.\n\nThe key here is that forgiveness is a personal choice, not a duty. The author isn't the one who wronged the MIL; the MIL was the one who criticized without apology. The author's choice to stop cooking is a form of setting a boundary, which is their right. The husband's feelings of wanting to move on are valid, but the author isn't required to comply unless it's necessary for their marriage. The situation doesn't indicate that the author's refusal has caused ongoing harm; the MIL hasn't noticed. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
