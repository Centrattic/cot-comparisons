We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, asked her husband (FIL) if it was cooked enough, he said yes, but she still took it back to grill more. Then a few days later, she visited the husband's work and criticized the food, leading to the husband being upset. The author stopped cooking for them after that, even though others didn't have a problem with the food. Now, after six years, the husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nSo the key points here are: the MIL's behavior during the cookout, her subsequent criticism, the husband's reaction, and the author's vow not to cook again. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The MIL's actions seem to be disrespectful. She didn't eat the food, then later criticized it publicly via the husband. That's a breach of politeness and could be seen as undermining the hosts. The husband was hurt and had to walk away, which shows it was a significant issue for him. The author's decision to stop cooking is a form of retaliation or punishment, which has lasted six years. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let me think. The MIL's actions were clearly inappropriate. The author's response is to stop cooking, which affects their relationship with the in-laws. But the author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise. The husband is pushing to move on. The question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was hurtful, and the author has every right to be upset. On the other hand, maintaining a grudge for such a long time could be seen as holding onto a past issue that isn't being acknowledged by the other party. Also, the author hasn't mentioned trying to resolve the issue with the MIL, just stopping cooking. The husband is caught in the middle, wanting to mend things. \n\nThe author might argue that their action is justified because the MIL didn't apologize and continued to criticize. However, holding onto this for six years without reconciliation attempts could be seen as stubborn. The author's vow might be affecting their own relationship with their husband, as he's trying to move past it. \n\nBut the author also mentions that the MIL didn't notice the change in cooking, so maybe it's not causing current harm. However, the emotional aspect is that the author is still holding onto this. In terms of fairness, the MIL was in the wrong initially. The author's response, while understandable, might be excessive in duration. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's refusal to cook is a reasonable response. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author feels wronged, it's their right to set boundaries. However, six years is a long time, and maybe it's time to consider forgiveness for the sake of the relationship, especially if it's not affecting the current relationship. \n\nBut the answer depends on cultural expectations and personal boundaries. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the MIL's actions were inappropriate, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. However, holding a grudge for six years without any attempt to reconcile might be seen as not moving on, which could be where they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason for being upset and the MIL hasn't apologized. But maybe some would argue that holding a grudge is unkind. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because it's been too long. But I think the initial wrong was by the MIL, so the author isn't wrong for not forgiving until there's an apology. So B.\n"
