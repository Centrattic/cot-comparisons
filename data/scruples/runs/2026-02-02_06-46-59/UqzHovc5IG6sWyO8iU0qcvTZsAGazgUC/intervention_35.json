We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and made the husband feel bad. The author stopped cooking for them as a result.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's actions were pretty inconsiderate\u2014publicly criticizing the food and making the husband walk away. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. Now the husband wants to move on, so the author is conflicted.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might argue that holding a grudge for so long over one incident isn't fair, especially since it's affecting the current relationship. But others might see the author as justified in protecting their boundaries after their husband was hurt. \n\nThe question is about right or wrong. Factors to consider: the MIL's initial disrespect, the author's reaction as a form of self-protection, the duration of the grudge, and the current impact on the relationship. The author hasn't cooked for them in years, but the MIL hasn't apologized. The husband is caught in the middle. \n\nIs the author wrong for not forgiving? Well, forgiveness is personal, but holding onto resentment without resolution can harm relationships. However, the MIL didn't apologize, so maybe the author's stance is understandable. On the other hand, the author's vow is a choice they made, and after six years, it's possible that moving on is healthier. \n\nThe user says the author is in the wrong, but maybe it's more about perspective. The answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong because they had a valid reason and the MIL didn't apologize. However, holding a grudge for so long could be seen as the author's choice, hence being in the wrong. \n\nI need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author's action stems from protecting their husband and themselves from further hurt, and the MIL never apologized, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if someone else was hurt by the author's refusal to cook, then maybe. However, the story states that the MIL hasn't noticed. So, the author's choice is their own, and they aren't in the wrong for not forgiving. Answer B.\n"
