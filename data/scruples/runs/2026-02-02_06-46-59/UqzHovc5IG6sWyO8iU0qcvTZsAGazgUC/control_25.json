We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat initially because she thought it wasn't cooked enough. The FIL said it was cooked, but she still took it back to grill more. Then a few days later, the MIL visited the husband at work and criticized the food, saying it was terrible and that she had to grill it herself. This upset the husband, who walked away and later confronted her, but she didn't apologize. The author then decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they should cook Easter dinner for them.\n\nThe author's main question is whether they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for so long. The key points here are the MIL's public criticism of the food, which was a personal attack on the author's cooking, and the ongoing refusal to cook for them as a result. The author feels justified because no one else had a problem with the food, and the MIL's actions were particularly hurtful. However, the husband wants closure, and the author is conflicted.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether holding a grudge for six years without reconciliation is unreasonable. The MIL's behavior was harsh and unkind, especially taking the opportunity to criticize the food when the author had gone to the effort of cooking for them. The author's response of refusing to cook for them again is a form of self-protection and setting a boundary, which can be valid. However, maintaining a grudge without any attempts at communication or resolution might be seen as extreme, especially if it's affecting the relationship with the husband.\n\nBut the author mentions that they still have a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise, so maybe the refusal to cook isn't causing harm. The husband's perspective is important here too; he wants to move on, which might indicate he's grown tired of the unresolved issue. However, the author's feelings are valid, and it's their decision to make. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable by not forgiving, but given the MIL's actions and the lack of apology, the author's stance is understandable.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, holding a grudge for years can be seen as stubborn, but in this case, the MIL's behavior was particularly hurtful and unapologetic. The author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing to protect their feelings. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), as their response is a personal choice based on past hurt, and there's no indication that the author is being unreasonable in their decision.\n"
