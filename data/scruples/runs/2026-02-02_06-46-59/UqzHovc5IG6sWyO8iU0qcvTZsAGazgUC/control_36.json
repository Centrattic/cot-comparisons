We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened six years ago. \n\nFirst, the incident: The author and her husband had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat and later criticized the food. The FIL said it was cooked, but the MIL took it back to grill. Then the MIL went to the husband's work and complained, which made him upset. The husband confronted her, but she didn't apologize, just repeated her criticism. The author stopped cooking for the MIL after that.\n\nNow, six years later, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether she's in the wrong for holding a grudge. The question is whether holding this grudge is unjustified.\n\nFactors to consider: The MIL's actions were unkind and unapologetic, which affected the husband emotionally. The author's decision to stop cooking was a personal choice, possibly to avoid further conflict. The husband is now asking to reconcile, but the author has reservations. \n\nIs the author wrong for still holding this grudge? Well, holding a grudge can be seen as negative, especially if it's affecting her relationship with her husband. However, the MIL's behavior was problematic, and the author felt justified in her response. The author hasn't cut off the MIL completely; she's just stopped cooking for them, which might not be a big issue if they haven't noticed. The husband might feel left out if he can't cook and the author won't either. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions (not cooking) are a personal choice and might not be wrong, especially given the MIL's unapologetic behavior. However, the duration (six years) and the husband's desire to move on might suggest that the author should consider forgiveness for the sake of family harmony. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's better for the family. Since the MIL was at fault initially, the author's reaction could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
