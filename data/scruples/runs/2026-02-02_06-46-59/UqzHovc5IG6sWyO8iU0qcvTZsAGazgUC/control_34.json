We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law (MIL) didn't like the meat at a cookout. She asked her husband (FIL) if it was cooked enough, he said yes. Then she didn't eat it, took it back to cook more. Later, MIL criticized the food and said she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset. The author decided not to cook for them again, and has held that vow for about six years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is hesitant.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The MIL's criticism was directed at the author's cooking, but she didn't confront the author directly. Instead, she talked to her son (the husband), which might have been hurtful. The husband was hurt and tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author then decided to stop cooking for them, which they've maintained for years. \n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for holding a grudge for so long. The key points here are the initial incident, the response from the MIL, the husband's reaction, and the author's ongoing decision not to cook again. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were particularly harsh, and no one else had issues. They feel justified in their stance. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was also inappropriate\u2014criticizing the food without direct communication and in a way that hurt the son.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, not cooking for the MIL might be a personal choice. But if the relationship is otherwise good and the author is willing to maintain the vow, maybe it's their right. However, the husband is suggesting moving on, so the author might be avoiding a potential conflict or not letting go of a past slight.\n\nI need to consider if holding a grudge for six years is unreasonable. The initial incident was a few days after the cookout. The MIL's behavior was passive-aggressive, and the author's response was to cut off cooking for them. If the author isn't cooking for them, but the relationship is otherwise okay, maybe it's not in the wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving the MIL.\n\nAlternatively, the author's reaction might be seen as excessive if the MIL's comment was a one-time issue and not a recurring problem. The author is making a personal choice about their time and emotional energy. But if it's causing tension in the marriage, maybe the author should reconsider.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's actions stem from a justified hurt, but holding on for six years might be seen as holding a grudge. However, in AITA scenarios, the line between justified and being in the wrong can be thin. The key factors are whether the author's response was reasonable. Since the author has a good relationship otherwise and the MIL hasn't apologized, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the response is disproportionate, they might be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL's behavior was the root issue, and the author's decision to stop cooking is a way to set boundaries. If the author isn't hurting anyone else (since the MILs haven't noticed), then it could be their choice.\n\nHmm. So I think the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The initial incident was a personal slight, and the author's response is a boundary set in response to hurtful behavior. The MIL's actions were inappropriate, and the author's choice to not cook for them again is a valid reaction. The husband's suggestion to move on is another angle, but the author isn't obligated to cook for them if they're not willing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
