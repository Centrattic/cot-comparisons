We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later complained about the quality, leading the writer to stop cooking for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The MIL was the only one who didn't eat the food, asked if the meat was cooked enough, then later took it back to grill. Then, a few days later, she criticized the food and told the husband that even though his wife cooked it, it was awful. The husband was upset and the writer decided to never cook for them again. Now, several years later, the husband wants to move on, but the writer is refusing to cook for them again, even for an Easter dinner.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's not like the MIL's feelings are hurt since they haven't noticed the lack of cooking. They also mention that their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good except for this incident.\n\nI need to evaluate whether holding a grudge for six years over this is reasonable. The key points here are the initial incident's severity, the lasting impact, and the proportionality of the response. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, especially since the family went to the effort of hosting a cookout. However, holding onto this for six years and refusing to cook for the family could be seen as an overreaction. The writer's vow might be affecting family dynamics and the husband's feelings, as he wants to move past it.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL did criticize the food publicly and privately, which could be justified as valid feedback if given respectfully. However, the manner in which she delivered it\u2014criticizing the food and implying the wife's cooking was bad\u2014could have been hurtful. The writer's response of cutting off cooking for them entirely might be a way to protect their feelings, but it's an extended period.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for holding this grudge. If the MIL never apologized and the author finds it hard to forgive, maybe it's understandable. However, the duration and the refusal to make amends, even for a significant event like Easter, might be seen as the author's fault. The husband's perspective is also important; he wants to mend things, so the author's stance could affect the family relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because holding onto a grudge for six years without any communication or effort to resolve the issue could be seen as unreasonable, even if the initial action was hurtful. However, some might argue that the MIL's behavior was the real issue. But the question is about the author's actions, so the prolonged refusal to forgive and the impact on the family dynamic might make the author at fault.\n"
