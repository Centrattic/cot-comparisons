We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food at first, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. Then, the MIL criticized the food and told the husband that he needed to improve. The author decided not to cook for them again, and this has lasted for six years. Now, the husband wants to move past this, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for so long. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's actions seem disrespectful. Public criticism, especially behind someone's back, is generally considered rude. The MIL's behavior could have been a personal slight, and the fact that she didn't apologize makes it worse. The husband was hurt, and the author's decision to stop cooking for them as a form of self-respect makes sense. Also, the author mentions that the MIL's criticism was unwarranted since no one else had a problem with the food. The author's actions are a form of self-protection and boundary-setting, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author hasn't mentioned trying to communicate their feelings to the MIL or seeking reconciliation. If the relationship with the husband is important, maybe moving past this could be beneficial. However, the author hasn't been cooking for them for years, and the MIL might not have noticed, so it's not causing active harm. The author has a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the issue isn't affecting other aspects of their relationship.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are intent, impact, and whether there's an opportunity for resolution. The MIL's intent was hurtful, and the impact was significant on the husband. The author's response was to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, holding onto this for six years without any attempt at resolution could be seen as stubborn. But since the author isn't actively engaging with the MIL negatively, maybe it's not wrong.\n\nAlso, the husband's desire to move forward is important. If the author is willing to let the husband cook (even though he's not great), maybe there's a way to honor the husband's wishes without the author having to cook. The author's stance is about respecting their own feelings and boundaries, which is valid. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe they should consider reconciliation if possible. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for not forgiving, and given the MIL's actions, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
