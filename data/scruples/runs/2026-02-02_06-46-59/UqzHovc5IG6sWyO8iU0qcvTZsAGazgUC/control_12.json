We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where the MIL criticized their cookout. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, took it back to cook more, and later criticized the food, leading to the husband being upset. The author then vowed not to cook for them again, and it's been six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and they're asking if the author is at fault for holding onto this grudge.\n\nThe main issue here is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were particularly hurtful because no one else had a problem with the food. The MIL's criticism was directed at the author's cooking, and the author feels it's a personal slight. However, the husband is pushing for reconciliation by having the author cook Easter dinner. \n\nFrom a conflict resolution perspective, holding a grudge for such a long time might not be healthy. The author is choosing not to cook for the MIL out of spite, even if the MIL might not even notice. The husband's reaction was to confront his mother, but she didn't apologize. The author's vow seems to be a form of punishment, which can strain family relationships over time. \n\nBut on the other hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. She criticized the food and took over the grilling, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author has a right to feel hurt. However, maintaining a six-year grudge without the other party showing remorse could be seen as their own issue, especially if it's affecting their relationship with their husband and MIL. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the grudge is justified. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author has kept their vow despite the husband's efforts to move on, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in terms of forgiveness, holding onto this for six years might not be healthy. The author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in feeling hurt, but in terms of AITA, the act of holding the grudge without the other party making amends could contribute to the problem. \n\nThe author's husband is trying to mend the relationship, and the author's refusal to cook might be hindering that. The author's reasoning is valid, but the length of the grudge and the impact on the family dynamics might make them partly at fault. However, the MIL's initial behavior was inconsiderate. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they were wronged first. But if the question is about forgiveness and moving on, maybe A. But since the author is choosing to hold the grudge, maybe A. However, the original question says if the author is in the wrong. The user might be looking for whether the author's stance is valid. Since the author has a valid grievance and the MIL hasn't apologized, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving. So the answer would be B.\n"
