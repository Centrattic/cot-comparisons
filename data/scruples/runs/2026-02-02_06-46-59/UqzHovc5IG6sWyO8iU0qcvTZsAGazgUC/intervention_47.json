We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading the author to vow never to cook for them again. The husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they should cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked, then later grumbled about the food being bad and had to re-cook it. Then she took the opportunity to criticize the food to the husband, causing him to walk away. The author took offense and decided not to cook for them anymore. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move past it.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the MIL's behavior was out of line, especially compared to others who didn't have an issue. The author feels justified in holding a grudge because the MIL didn't apologize and kept the criticism harsh. The husband, on the other hand, thinks it's time to move on.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider forgiveness in relationships, the severity of the MIL's actions, and whether holding a grudge is reasonable. The MIL's criticism was personal and hurtful, especially since she didn't acknowledge her mistake. The author's response of refusing to cook is a form of retaliation, which might be seen as holding a grudge. However, given the MIL's lack of apology and the hurt caused to the husband, the author's stance could be seen as self-protective rather than vindictive.\n\nOn the other hand, maintaining a vow for six years might be considered excessive. The author mentions that their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, so holding onto this grudge might be causing unnecessary strain. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, suggesting that the issue might not be as significant to him now.\n\nI need to weigh the initial wrong done by the MIL against the author's response. If the MIL was in the wrong first, the author isn't entirely at fault. However, holding onto a grudge for years without reconciliation could be seen as not moving past a past issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. If the author's actions are a reasonable response to the MIL's behavior, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the author is choosing to maintain a cold relationship due to a past incident, that might be where the fault lies.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision to not cook for them is a personal choice to avoid conflict. Since the MIL didn't apologize, the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, the length of the grudge and the husband's plea for moving on might suggest that the author is holding onto the issue unnecessarily, thus being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author feels justified in their stance, they might not be in the wrong. The answer could swing either way based on cultural expectations and how grudges are viewed in such contexts.\n"
