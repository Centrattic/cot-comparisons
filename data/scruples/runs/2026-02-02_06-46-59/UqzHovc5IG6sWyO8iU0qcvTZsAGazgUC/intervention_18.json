We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later took it upon herself to reheat it, then later complained again to the husband. The author hasn't cooked for their in-laws since, and now the husband wants to move on, especially for an upcoming Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both sides. The MIL's behavior was definitely inconsiderate. She publicly criticized the food and then proceeded to fix it herself, which is a breach of etiquette. It's also hurtful that she then went to the husband and reiterated her criticism, causing him emotional distress. That's pretty harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore as a result. They argue that no one else had issues with the food except the MIL, so the criticism was unwarranted. The author's vow to not cook again has lasted six years. Now, the husband wants to put the past behind them. The author is considering if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for so long.\n\nI think the key points here are about forgiveness and moving on. The author's reaction is a long-term hold on a past mistake. While the MIL's actions were clearly wrong, the author's refusal to cook for them for years might be considered holding a grudge unnecessarily. The husband is trying to mend the relationship, suggesting that the author's stance is affecting the family dynamic. Also, the author mentions that the in-laws might not even have noticed the absence of their cooking, implying that the author's punishment isn't being felt by the in-laws, so it's not causing them pain. However, the author's continued resentment might be affecting their own family relationships, especially with the husband.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the MIL was definitely in the wrong. However, the author's prolonged refusal to reconcile could be seen as holding a grudge. While it's understandable to feel hurt, maintaining a six-year grudge might not be fair. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, and if the author is willing to cook for them again, it could help heal the rift. The author's reasoning that no one else had a problem with the food supports their side, but the main issue is whether holding onto this for so long is justified. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not letting go of the past. The initial incident was a mistake, but holding onto it for years without resolution or communication might be counterproductive. The author could benefit from forgiveness and moving past this to maintain a healthy relationship with the in-laws and the husband. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
