We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's MIL criticized the food at a cookout, despite the meat being properly cooked. Then, the husband was upset, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author decided to stop cooking for them, and now after 6 years, the husband wants to move on. The author is considering whether to cook an Easter dinner despite their vow.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess if that's correct. Let's break it down. The MIL's behavior was unkind and unnecessary. She publicly criticized the food, even though the husband's father said the meat was cooked. This caused emotional distress to the husband, and she didn't apologize. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which they've maintained for years. \n\nIs holding a grudge for 6 years justified? Well, the initial incident was hurtful and unapologetic. The author's vow was a personal choice stemming from a valid hurt. However, holding onto it for so long might not be healthy. The husband is urging to move on, which suggests he's trying to mend the relationship. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was unfounded and that others didn't have issues. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not forgiving? The key here is whether the author's action (refusing to cook) is a reasonable response. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author felt wronged, their reaction is understandable. However, holding a grudge for six years without any attempt at reconciliation from the MIL's side might be seen as stubborn. The author could be seen as choosing not to let the MIL's past behavior affect current relationships, especially if the MIL hasn't changed. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's husband is trying to move past it, and the author's refusal might affect family dynamics. But the author isn't causing harm except to their own relationship with the MIL. Since the MIL hasn't acknowledged her mistake, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting by holding onto this for so long, especially if the MIL hasn't made any effort to reconnect. It's a balance between forgiveness and self-respect. The author might be justified in their stance if they feel the MIL's actions were disrespectful. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions stem from a valid grievance and the MIL hasn't shown remorse. However, if the author is causing unnecessary tension in the marriage by not moving on, maybe A. But the story says the author's husband is trying to move on, not the author. The author is the one holding the grudge. \n\nHmm. The user says they think the author is wrong. I need to consider both sides. The author's decision is their choice, but holding onto a six-year grudge without any communication from the MIL might be seen as holding a grudge. However, the author isn't causing harm; they're just not cooking. So maybe it's not the author's fault. The answer is B.\n"
