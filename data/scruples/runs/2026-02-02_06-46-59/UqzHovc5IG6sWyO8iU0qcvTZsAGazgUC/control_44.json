We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (OP) had a cookout where her mother-in-law (MIL) criticized the food. The MIL didn't eat at first, then grilled her meat more. Later, the MIL complained to the husband about the food quality, leading the OP to vow never to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and she's wondering if holding this grudge for six years makes her the \"asshole.\"\n\nHmm. So the main points are about forgiveness, holding a grudge, and whether the OP's reaction is justified. The OP's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was harsh and public, and she's been avoiding cooking for them as a result. The husband wants to move past it, but the OP is resistant.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the MIL's actions were unkind and possibly hurtful. She criticized the food to the husband, which embarrassed him and caused him to walk away. The OP felt justified in not cooking for them again because no one else had issues with the food. So maybe she's standing up for herself and her cooking.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The OP mentions that the MIL might not even notice the change, so maybe the grudge isn't affecting anyone else. However, the husband wants to move on, and the OP is choosing not to participate in family events (like Easter dinner) because of past hurt. That could create tension in the marriage.\n\nBut the key here is whether the OP is in the wrong. The initial MIL's behavior was inappropriate, so the OP's response might be seen as a reasonable boundary. If the MIL never apologized, then the OP doesn't have to forgive her, especially if it's about respecting her own worth as a cook. The husband might feel caught in the middle, but the OP isn't necessarily wrong for protecting her feelings and setting a boundary.\n\nAlso, the fact that the OP has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise suggests that this is a specific issue, not a general dislike. So maybe the OP isn't in the wrong for not forgiving the MIL. The answer would be B (No).\n"
