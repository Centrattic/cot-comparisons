We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and made the author's husband upset. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the events. The author and their husband made a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat initially, asked her husband if the meat was cooked, then later grilled it herself. Then a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and told the husband, causing him to walk away. The author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore. It's been six years, and the husband is asking if they should reconcile this by having the author cook again, like for Easter.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, the key points here are: the MIL's actions, the husband's reaction, the author's decision to stop cooking, and the current request to move on. \n\nFirst, the MIL's behavior: She didn't eat the food, then later went back to cook it herself. Then, she criticized the food to the husband, which hurt him. The author took this as a personal slight, possibly because no one else had a problem with the food, just the MIL. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband wants to move past it now.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness and holding grudges are complex. The MIL's actions were rude and ungracious, which could justify the author's feelings. However, holding a grudge for six years over an incident might be seen as excessive. The author's vow to never cook again is a long-standing action that could be seen as a punishment, even if the MIL hasn't noticed. The husband is now asking to move on, which might be part of maintaining family relationships.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they were hurt by the MIL's criticism, especially since no one else had a problem. The husband was also hurt, and the author is supporting his feelings. However, is it fair to keep this grudge for such a long time? It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, and the author is standing by their decision. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be unreasonable, especially if the MIL has not apologized and there's no indication of change. However, the author is also considering the husband's wishes and the potential for family harmony.\n\nI think the author's position is understandable. The MIL's actions were unkind, and the author's response was to protect their own feelings and their husband's. If the MIL hasn't changed, then the author's stance might be justified. But if the husband is now urging reconciliation, the author might need to consider whether letting go would be healthier in the long run. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the MIL was the one who caused the initial harm, and the author's response is a personal choice about their own actions, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No). But some might argue that holding a grudge is wrong regardless. It's a bit of a judgment call here. The original poster's reasoning is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
