We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The key events are:\n\n1. The couple had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. The FIL said it was okay, but she still didn't eat it. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and told the husband she had to grill it herself, which upset him.\n\n2. The husband was hurt and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author (the wife) decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore, which she's been doing for 6 years. Now the husband wants to move on and have her cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge and not cooking for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the MIL's actions. She didn't eat the food, asked her husband about it, then took it back to grill. That might be a cultural or personal preference\u2014maybe she's a picky eater. However, later, she criticized the food and made the husband feel bad. That's where the issue lies. The MIL's public criticism and refusal to apologize hurt the husband, and the author is now punishing the in-laws by not cooking for them.\n\nThe author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice. She's not in the wrong if she feels that the MIL's actions were disrespectful and that holding the grudge is justified. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for 6 years is excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't made amends and the author is avoiding a relationship aspect (cooking) that's not critical.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's husband is pushing for reconciliation, and the author is considering it. The author's reasoning is that the in-laws haven't noticed the lack of cooking, so maybe it's not affecting their relationship. But the author is making a choice based on a past hurt, which is personal.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about whether the person's actions are reasonable. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking again, and the MIL hasn't apologized. The author's stance is about respecting their own feelings. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing by her decision after a hurtful incident where the other party didn't apologize.\n"
