We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food, later criticized it, and the author has since vowed not to cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL found the meat undercooked, didn't eat it, then later complained to the husband. The husband was upset, and the author stopped cooking for them. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about whether to cook Easter dinner this year.\n\nSo, the question is about forgiveness and whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was the only one to criticize the food, and others didn't have issues. The MIL didn't apologize, and the author's vow is a form of self-respect, maybe. \n\nI should consider the context. The cookout was a shared effort between the author and husband. The MIL's criticism might have been harsh and public, but the author's reaction is to stop cooking for them. The husband is now asking to move past it, so maybe the family wants to reconcile. \n\nThe author argues that others didn't complain, so the MIL's actions were especially negative. The vow might be a way to express that the author's efforts were not appreciated. But holding it for six years could be seen as stubborn or overly sensitive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good. So maybe the cooking was a way to avoid conflict or show respect. However, not cooking for family on holidays could be seen as a passive-aggressive action. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The MIL's behavior was hurtful and unappreciative. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a valid boundary. But the question is about forgiveness. The husband is caught in the middle, and the author might be causing him stress by not complying with his wishes to move on. \n\nThe key factors: Did the author overreact? Is it fair to hold a grudge this long? Are there attempts to resolve the issue? The author didn't directly address the issue with the MIL, only through the husband. The MIL didn't apologize, so maybe the author is justified in not wanting to interact in a way that reopens the wound. \n\nBut in relationships, holding onto past events can cause long-term issues. The author's action of not cooking is a way to protect their feelings, which is understandable. However, the husband's request to move on suggests that he might want to mend the family relationship. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The MIL's actions were unkind and ungrateful, and the author's response is a way to maintain self-respect. If the MIL never apologized, the author isn't obligated to forgive. Cooking Easter dinner would be a personal choice, not a requirement. The author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if it's something that still affects their husband. Plus, the author states they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the vow is a minor issue in the grand scheme. The problem is the MIL's behavior, not the author's refusal to cook. The author is just protecting their feelings and the husband's well-being.\n"
