We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food and made her husband-in-law uncomfortable. The author has since stopped cooking for them, and now their husband wants to move on. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding onto this grudge for six years.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's actions: at the cookout, she refused to eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then when she wasn't satisfied, took it back to grill it herself. Then, a few days later, she criticized the food and blamed the husband for having to grill it. The husband was hurt and told her, but she didn't apologize. The author decided not to cook for them again because of this, even though they had previously hosted monthly dinners. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they should cook Easter dinner this year.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that because the MIL was so critical and the husband didn't apologize, they've held a grudge for six years. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, forgiveness can be a personal choice. The author's decision to stop cooking is a form of a grudge, which can be seen as holding onto past hurt. However, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and harsh. The author might feel justified in their reaction, especially if the MIL hasn't shown remorse. \n\nBut holding onto this for six years might be seen as not moving forward. The author mentions that their husband is pushing for reconciliation and they have a good relationship otherwise. The author's action of cutting off cooking could be seen as a silent protest, but if it's causing ongoing tension or preventing a good relationship, maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's initial criticism was directed at the husband, not the author, so the author's response might be valid as a way to support their husband. However, the author's decision to not cook for them might be affecting their relationship with the MIL, which could be unnecessary if the MIL hasn't acknowledged her actions. \n\nThe key factors here are: 1) The MIL's behavior was inappropriate, 2) The author's reaction is a personal choice, but holding a grudge for six years might be excessive, 3) The husband is seeking reconciliation, 4) The author's action (not cooking) doesn't seem to be causing direct harm to others (they mention that the MIL might not notice). \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for balance between the parties. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting their feelings and supporting their husband's hurt. However, holding onto resentment for so long without any communication or attempt at resolution could be seen as not taking responsibility for the relationship. If the author is choosing to let go of the grudge for the sake of family harmony, that might be the more mature choice. But if the MIL hasn't apologized, the author isn't obligated to forgive. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable given the MIL's behavior. Since the MIL was harsh and didn't apologize, the author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as justified. However, after six years, it might be time to reassess if holding the grudge is still beneficial. The user's question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions are a personal choice in response to a hurtful incident, and they aren't causing harm to others. The MIL is the one who initiated the conflict, so the author isn't necessarily at fault for not forgiving. But if the author is now causing unnecessary tension by not cooking, maybe they are. However, the author isn't causing harm; they are just choosing not to cook. So the answer is B.\n"
