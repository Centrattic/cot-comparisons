We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and then took it upon herself to re-cook it. Later, the MIL complained to the husband about the food quality, which upset him. The author stopped cooking for the MIL family after that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of each party. The MIL's behavior seems unkind. She publicly criticized the food by grilling it herself and then later, when alone with her son, criticized the food again, leading to emotional distress. The husband was hurt and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. \n\nThe key points here are: the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic, the author's vow to not cook again is a personal choice, and the husband now wants the author to move on. The author argues that no one else had issues except the MIL, implying her criticism was unwarranted. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as extreme. However, the MIL's actions were disrespectful. The author isn't obligated to cook for them if it causes resentment. The husband's desire for reconciliation is valid, but the author isn't obligated to comply if it's not in their best interest. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL was at fault. The author's response, while long-standing, is a personal choice to protect themselves. The husband's push to move on is reasonable, but the author isn't wrong for choosing not to cook. So, answer B.\n"
