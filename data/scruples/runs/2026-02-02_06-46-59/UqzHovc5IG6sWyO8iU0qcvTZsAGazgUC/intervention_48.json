We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who hasn't forgiven her mother-in-law (MIL) for a comment made six years ago. The MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading the woman to vow never to cook for them again. Now her husband wants her to cook for Easter, but she's reluctant.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL made a comment about the meat not being cooked enough during a cookout. She took the meat back to the grill, and later criticized the food in front of her son, causing him emotional distress. The author stopped cooking for them because of this, and six years later, the husband is pushing her to cook again.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. She publicly criticized the food and made her son uncomfortable. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which could be seen as a reasonable boundary given the past incident. But holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The husband wants to move on, and the author is being asked to reconcile.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that no one else had an issue with the food except the MIL. The author's stance is about respecting her own feelings and maintaining a personal boundary. The question is whether holding onto this grudge is justified or if forgiveness is necessary here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, holding onto a grudge for that long could be seen as the author's fault, especially if there's an opportunity to mend relations. But if the MIL never apologized and the author feels justified in her stance, maybe she's not in the wrong. It's a balance between personal boundaries and family dynamics. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are impacting others unnecessarily. Since the husband is involved and wants to move forward, but the author is standing her ground, the question is whether that's fair.\n\nI think the key is that the author is prioritizing her own emotional well-being by setting boundaries, which can be valid. But the length of time might be an issue. However, since the MIL hasn't apologized and the incident was significant, the author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as justified. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the husband's family isn't aware of the change, maybe the author isn't harming anyone, so it's a personal choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
