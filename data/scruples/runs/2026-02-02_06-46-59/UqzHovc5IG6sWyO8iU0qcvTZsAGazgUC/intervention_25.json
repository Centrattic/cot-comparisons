We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and her mother-in-law (MIL) over a cookout incident years ago. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and her husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her FIL if it was cooked enough, and then later took it back to grill more. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and told the husband she had to grill it herself, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them again, and this has been going on for 6 years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe author's main issue is holding a grudge over an event that happened years ago. The question is whether her decision to stop cooking for her in-laws is justified or if she's being unreasonable. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's actions were unkind and hurtful. She criticized the food in front of others and made a comment that implied the author's cooking was bad. The husband was hurt by this, and the author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a way to protect herself and her husband from future pain.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for 6 years might be excessive. The author mentions that no one else had issues with the food except the MIL. The husband is now pushing to move on, and the author is being asked if she's in the wrong for not forgiving. The key here is whether the grudge is justified or if the author is overreacting. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were specific to her, not others, which adds to the personal nature of the hurt. However, the time span is significant. The author's stance is that she's not in the wrong because the MIL didn't apologize and the incident was a clear breach. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't wrong. It's about personal boundaries. If the author feels that cooking for them triggers negative memories and the MIL hasn't shown remorse, it's her right to set that boundary. However, the husband might feel that moving on is necessary for family harmony. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are justified. Since the MIL's behavior was unkind and the author is protecting herself, maybe the author isn't wrong. But others might argue that holding a grudge for so long is not healthy. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or personal values. \n\nIn the end, the author is choosing to maintain her stance, and if the husband is okay with it, maybe it's not the author's fault. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
