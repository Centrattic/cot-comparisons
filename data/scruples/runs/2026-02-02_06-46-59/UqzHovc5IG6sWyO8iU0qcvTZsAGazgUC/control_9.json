We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law after an incident with a cookout. So, the main event is that the MIL didn't like the food, took the meat back to grill it, and later criticized the food, leading the author to vow not to cook for them again. Now the husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's MIL was critical, which upset the husband. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. The question is whether holding this grudge for 6 years is wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel justified because the MIL's criticism was harsh and unapologetic. The husband was hurt, and the author made a promise not to cook again. Also, they mention that no one else had issues with the food, so the MIL's complaint might have been over the top. The author also says they don't think the in-laws have noticed the absence of their cooking, implying that maybe their vow isn't affecting others negatively.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The husband wants to move on, which could affect their relationship. The author is avoiding a potential conflict by not cooking, but it's also a long time. The key factors here are: the initial incident's severity, the author's response (vow not to cook), and the current impact on relationships.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the MIL was unreasonably critical, and since others didn't have issues, it's the MIL's problem. However, cutting off a relationship or holding a grudge for this long might be seen as extreme. The author's husband is trying to reconcile, suggesting that forgiveness is needed. The author's position is understandable, but maybe the length of time is the issue here.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but holding onto it for so long without resolution might be. The husband's side is also valid\u2014moving past the issue for a healthier relationship. The author's solution of only grilling (since the husband can't cook) might be a compromise, but maybe the author is being too rigid. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are causing harm. Since they mention that the in-laws haven't noticed, maybe it's not hurting anyone else. But the husband is affected. Still, the author's decision is a personal choice. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author has a valid reason based on the MIL's behavior and their own feelings. However, if the situation is affecting the marriage, maybe the author should reconsider. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's best for the relationship. Since the author has a reason and the MIL didn't apologize, it's a justified stance. So, answer B.\n"
