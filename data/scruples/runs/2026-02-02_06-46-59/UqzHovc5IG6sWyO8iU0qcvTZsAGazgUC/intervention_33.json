We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident at a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's MIL criticized the food, took her meat back to the grill, and later told the husband the food was terrible. The husband was upset, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws again for six years. Now the husband wants them to move on, maybe cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The MIL's actions might have been harsh and hurtful. She made a comment that led the husband to feel hurt, and the author stopped cooking as a result. Holding a grudge for six years is a long time. However, the author's decision not to cook is a personal choice, maybe a way to protect themselves from past hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is asking for reconciliation. The author might feel justified in not wanting to cook again because of the past incident. But maybe not cooking isn't fair to the husband or the in-laws, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this.\n\nLegal terms aren't applicable here, but in terms of social norms and relationships, forgiveness and moving on are often encouraged. The author's stance might be seen as holding a grudge, which isn't healthy. However, if they feel hurt and the other party hasn't apologized, it's understandable. The key is whether the author's continued refusal is justified given the circumstances.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the author's intention and the impact. If the author is still hurt and the MIL hasn't made amends, it's not entirely their fault. But holding onto it for six years without communication might be seen as the author not letting go. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for six years without resolution might be seen as not moving on, even if the MIL was at fault initially. The author's decision to not cook is a personal choice, but in the context of the relationship, it's more about forgiveness and setting boundaries. The husband's perspective is to move forward, so the author's refusal could be seen as the wrong choice in maintaining family harmony.\n"
