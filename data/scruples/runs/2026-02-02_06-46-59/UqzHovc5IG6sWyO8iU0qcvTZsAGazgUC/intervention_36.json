We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened six years ago. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. Then a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and blamed the husband when he tried to address her comments. The author decided not to cook for them again, and has kept that vow for six years now. The husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they're the one at fault.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that no one else had a problem with the food except the MIL, so they feel justified. They also mention that the MIL didn't apologize, so the author holds a grudge. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this for so long.\n\nHmm. So, on one hand, the MIL's actions were pretty hurtful. She criticized the food and the way it was prepared in front of others, then later didn't apologize. That's definitely a problem. The husband was upset and the author's decision to stop cooking for them seems like a reasonable reaction to protect their husband's feelings and their own.\n\nBut holding a grudge for six years? That's a long time. The author's husband is asking to move on, and the author is being stubborn. The author also mentions that maybe the MIL didn't even notice the change in behavior, so it's not like the MIL is suffering. The author's relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, except for this incident. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a way to avoid conflict and to not let the MIL's behavior affect them. But holding onto this for six years might be seen as the author not letting go, which could affect the marriage if the husband is pushing for reconciliation.\n\nI think the key here is the duration and the impact on the relationship. The author might be right to be upset initially, but holding onto it for six years without any contact or attempt to reconcile might be too long. The husband is asking for the author to move on, which could indicate that the author is being unreasonable in holding onto the past. \n\nHowever, the author's stance is that they won't cook again unless the MIL apologizes or something, which she never did. The author's action is a form of punishment, but since the MIL isn't aware, maybe it's not effective. But the author might feel they're standing up for their husband's feelings. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because holding onto this grudge for so long is affecting their relationship with their husband and not allowing for forgiveness and moving forward. Even though the MIL was at fault initially, the author's refusal to cook for six years is an overreaction. The author could still maintain a good relationship while setting boundaries, perhaps by cooking a meal without the pressure of the past incident. The husband's desire to move on suggests that the author should consider doing the same, especially if it's causing marital tension. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
