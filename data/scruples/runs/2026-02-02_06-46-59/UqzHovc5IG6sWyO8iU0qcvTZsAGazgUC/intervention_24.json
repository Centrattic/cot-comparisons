We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the story) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened several years ago.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, questioned the cooking, and later criticized the food and the husband when the in-laws visited. The husband was hurt, the author decided not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the MIL's actions and how the author has responded. The MIL criticized the food and the husband's cooking, which led to the husband feeling hurt. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. The question is whether holding this grudge for six years is justified.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the MIL's behavior was unkind and hurtful, especially since she didn't apologize. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a way to set a boundary. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be considered excessive, especially if there's no ongoing conflict and the relationship is otherwise good. The author's husband is trying to move past it, which could be a sign that the author should reconsider their stance.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that no one else had an issue with the food, only the MIL. This makes the criticism seem especially harsh. However, the author's response is a complete refusal to cook for them, which might be an overreaction. It's possible that the author is using this as a way to vent their frustration or protect their husband's feelings, but maintaining a grudge for so long might not be healthy or necessary.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, forgiveness and moving on are often encouraged, especially when there's no further conflict. The author's husband seems to be in a good place to reconcile, so the author might be resisting necessary reconciliation. However, the author's decision not to cook might not actually affect the MILs, as they might not even notice. This could mean the author's punishment isn't effective or necessary.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong. While the MIL's actions were hurtful, holding a six-year grudge without any apparent resolution or communication might be too much. The author could benefit from forgiveness and perhaps setting new boundaries instead of a complete cutoff. The husband's willingness to move on suggests that the author should consider doing the same.\n"
