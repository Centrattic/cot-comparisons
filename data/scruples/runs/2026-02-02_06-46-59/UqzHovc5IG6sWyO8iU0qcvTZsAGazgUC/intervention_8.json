We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later complained to the husband, causing him distress. The author has vowed not to cook for them since, which has lasted six years. The husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, questioned it, then later gave a harsh critique. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author's reaction was a vow to stop cooking for them. Now, after years, the husband wants to move past it.\n\nThe author's stance is that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's complaint was unwarranted. They feel justified in not cooking for them. But the husband is pushing for reconciliation. The question is whether the author's refusal to cook after six years is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider forgiveness, the duration of the hold-grudge, and the impact on the relationship. The author hasn't mentioned apologizing or seeking to understand the MIL's perspective. Holding a grudge for six years over a single incident might be excessive. Also, the author's husband is trying to move forward, which is a positive step. The author's refusal could be seen as hindering that.\n\nHowever, the author might feel hurt by the MIL's actions and the husband's initial reaction. But six years is a long time. In many relationships, holding onto a grudge for that long can be damaging. The author's action of not cooking could be a passive-aggressive response, which might not be healthy for the relationship long-term. The fact that the author hasn't mentioned any efforts to reconcile or talk to the MIL adds to the idea that they might be in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL didn't apologize, so the author might feel they have a right to be upset. But the length of the hold-grudge and the refusal to move past it, even after the husband has tried to address it, might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong. The author's actions are affecting their own relationship with the husband and possibly the MIL's family as a whole, even if the MIL hasn't noticed.\n\nSo, considering the time that's passed and the husband's desire to move on, the author might be in the wrong for not letting go. The answer would be A (Yes) because holding onto the grudge for so long without trying to reconcile could be seen as the author's fault.\n"
