We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident years ago. The situation was a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though the meat was actually cooked properly. The author decided not to cook for them again, and now after six years, their husband wants them to move on and cook an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate\u2014publicly criticizing the food, even though the meat was cooked, and then later complaining to the husband. The husband was upset by this, and the author took it as a personal slight, leading to a vow not to cook for them again. Now, after six years, the husband is pushing to move past it.\n\nThe author argues that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism was especially harsh. They also mention that their relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good, and maybe the MIL doesn't even notice the lack of cooking. The question is whether holding this grudge for six years is justified.\n\nFrom a perspective of forgiveness and moving on, holding a grudge that long might be seen as excessive, especially if there's no reconciliation from the MIL. The author's action of cutting off cooking as a form of punishment might be seen as a silent treatment, which isn't effective if the goal is to improve the relationship. However, the MIL's behavior was disrespectful, and the husband was hurt by her comments, so the author's reaction isn't entirely unfounded.\n\nOn the other hand, maintaining a vow for six years could be seen as holding onto resentment unnecessarily. The husband is trying to move past it, and the author's continued refusal might affect their relationship. The key here is whether the author's actions are causing more harm than good. Since the author mentions the relationship is otherwise good, maybe the issue is minor, and the author's reaction is disproportionate.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the MIL definitely acted inconsiderately, but the author's response is a long-term hold on a past event. It's possible that the author is taking on the role of the hurt party, but maybe they need to consider whether this grudge is affecting their own well-being or their marriage. The husband is caught between two people, and the author's refusal to cook could be straining that.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for not letting go of the situation after such a long time, especially if there's no indication that the MIL has apologized or changed her behavior. Holding a grudge for six years without any resolution might be harmful, even if the initial incident was valid. The answer would likely be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are holding onto a past issue that's affecting their current relationships without resolution.\n"
