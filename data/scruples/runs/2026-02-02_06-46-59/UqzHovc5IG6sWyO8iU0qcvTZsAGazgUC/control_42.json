We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) over an incident that happened years ago.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband hosted a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though she didn't eat it and then re-cooked her meat. Later, the MIL made a comment about the food being terrible and needing her to grill it, which upset the husband. The author stopped cooking for the MIL's family since then, and now the husband wants them to cook Easter dinner. The author is conflicted about whether holding a grudge for six years is fair.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong in their stance. The key points here are the author's decision to hold a grudge based on a past event. The MIL's actions were inappropriate\u2014criticizing the food after not eating it and then taking over grilling. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which seems like a reasonable boundary. However, holding onto that grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. \n\nOn one hand, it's valid to set boundaries after being wronged, especially if it's a one-time incident and the relationship is otherwise good. The author mentions that the MIL hasn't apologized, so the lack of resolution could justify the author's stance. On the other hand, some might argue that holding a grudge for so long isn't healthy and that moving on is necessary for family harmony.\n\nThe husband's request to cook Easter dinner adds pressure, but the author is standing by their decision. The question is whether this is justified. Since the author hasn't been hurt again, and the MIL hasn't shown remorse, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for maintaining their boundary. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author is protecting their feelings and setting boundaries, which is a valid response to past hurt.\n"
