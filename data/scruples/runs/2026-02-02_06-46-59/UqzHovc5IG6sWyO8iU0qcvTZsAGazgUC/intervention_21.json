We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a MIL (Mother-in-Law) who criticized the cookout food and the author has not forgiven her for six years, even vowing not to cook for them again. The husband wants to move on and maybe cook an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her FIL if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then she criticized the food, leading the husband to be upset. The author stopped cooking for them because of this. Now the husband wants to move past it, but the author is resistant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the answer. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nHmm. So, on one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. She publicly criticized the food and made the husband uncomfortable. The author's reaction is understandable as a way to avoid further conflict. However, holding a grudge for six years and refusing to cook for them even if it's causing strain in the marriage might be excessive. The author is not justifying the MIL's actions, but maybe the response is too harsh. The husband is part of the relationship, so refusing to cook for his parents could affect their marriage. The author might be prioritizing their own feelings over the marital relationship. Also, the author mentions that maybe the MIL hasn't noticed the change, so it's unclear if there's even a current issue. The key points are whether the punishment (six years of no cooking) is disproportionate to the offense, and if holding this grudge is affecting the marriage. \n\nIn many cases, forgiveness and moving on are considered important, especially when it's affecting the spouse. The author's stance might be seen as stubborn, even if the MIL was at fault. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for so long without any apparent resolution could be harming the marital relationship. Alternatively, if the MIL hasn't apologized and the author feels justified, maybe B. But in AITA contexts, long-held grudges are often considered the person's own fault, even if initially wronged.\n"
