We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat, had it cooked more, and later criticized the food. The husband was upset, and the author decided to stop cooking for the MIL. Now, years later, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're not in the wrong because the MIL was harsh and no one else had complaints. They also mention that the MIL didn't apologize. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, probably because holding a grudge for 6 years is too long.\n\nConsidering the key points: The MIL's actions were rude and hurtful, but the author's response was to cut off cooking for them entirely. While the initial criticism was unfair, holding a grudge for six years and refusing to cook even if the MIL hasn't noticed might be seen as excessive. The author's husband is trying to move on, which is a positive step, but the author is resisting. \n\nIt's important to assess whether the punishment fits the offense. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, but a six-year vendetta without communication might be too harsh. The author's decision to not cook could be seen as a personal choice, but in terms of family dynamics, it might be healthier to forgive, especially if the MIL hasn't acknowledged wrongdoing. However, forgiveness is personal, and the author isn't obligated to cook if it causes them stress. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are causing ongoing harm without resolving the issue, maybe they are. But if the author feels justified in protecting their feelings, maybe not. The answer might hinge on the context of their relationship and the MIL's behavior since then. Since the author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise, maybe the issue is resolved except for this grudge. In that case, holding onto it could be seen as unnecessary. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the prolonged grudge, but others might say B (No) because the MIL's actions justified the response. Need to weigh the balance here.\n"
