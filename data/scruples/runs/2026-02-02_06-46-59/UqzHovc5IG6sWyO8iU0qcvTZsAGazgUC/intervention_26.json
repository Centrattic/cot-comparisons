We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. The situation involves a cookout where MIL criticized the food and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The MIL's action was to criticize the food because she thought the meat wasn't cooked enough. She didn't say it in front of others, but later told her husband that the food was bad, which upset him. The author took this as a personal slight and stopped cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband is now suggesting moving past it.\n\nThe author argues that no one else had a problem with the food, so they felt the criticism was unfair. They feel justified in their decision, thinking it's not hurting anyone else. But the husband wants to reconcile.\n\nFrom a forgiveness standpoint, holding a grudge for six years seems excessive, especially if the MIL didn't apologize. But maybe the author felt disrespected. However, the response of the husband was that he was hurt by his mother's words, so he tried to address it. The author then made a vow to never cook again, which might have been a reaction to protect themselves from future criticism. \n\nBut is that in the wrong? Well, the author's action is a personal choice. They might feel justified, but withholding something (cooking) for six years without communication could be seen as holding a grudge. However, if the MIL never apologized, maybe the author is within their right to set a boundary. The question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving. \n\nForgiveness is a personal decision and isn't always required. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" maybe the author isn't necessarily wrong because they're protecting their feelings. However, the question is from a moral standpoint, like in an AITA scenario. \n\nAITA threads often consider if someone's reaction is reasonable. The author's reaction is to stop cooking, which might be seen as a reasonable boundary given the MIL's criticism and lack of apology. But holding it for six years and refusing to move on might be seen as stubborn. However, the husband is the one pushing to move on, so the author's stance is valid. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's reaction is proportional. The initial incident wasn't a huge offense, so holding onto it for six years could be seen as overreacting. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But if the author feels the boundary is necessary for their peace of mind, then maybe not. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A or B. The key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes. If B, no. \n\nConsidering that the author made a vow and kept it for six years without the MIL's apology, it's possible that the author is holding a grudge, which could be seen as being in the wrong. However, setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. So it's a bit of a gray area. But in AITA contexts, sometimes the person who holds a grudge is seen as at fault. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
