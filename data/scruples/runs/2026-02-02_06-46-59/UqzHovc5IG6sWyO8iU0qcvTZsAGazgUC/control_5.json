We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family conflict involving the mother-in-law (MIL) and the author. The main issue centers around a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food and later criticized it, leading to the author deciding not to cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL didn't eat the meat because she thought it wasn't cooked enough. The FIL said it was cooked, but she still went back to reheat it. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and told her son (the husband) that the food was terrible and she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author then decided not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on and cook an Easter dinner, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for holding this grudge for six years. The key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. The MIL's actions were clearly inappropriate. She publicly criticized the food and undermined the effort the husband and author put into the cookout. Moreover, she didn't apologize, which makes it worse. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted years. \n\nBut is that a reasonable response? Well, the author isn't cooking because of the MIL's past behavior. The author isn't obligated to cook for them, so the refusal might be a personal choice rather than a wrong. However, holding onto this for six years might be seen as excessive. The husband wants to move on, which is understandable. The author might be holding onto a grudge. But the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author's decision could be a way to protect themselves from further hurt.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food. Only the MIL complained. This highlights that the issue was specifically with the MIL's behavior. If the author is still upset because the MIL didn't acknowledge her actions, then holding this grudge is about the lack of accountability from the MIL. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything illegal or violating a clear social norm beyond holding a grudge. The husband wants reconciliation, but the author is justified in feeling hurt. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the MIL's actions were the problem, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or cook for them. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as harsh, but given the MIL's lack of apology, maybe it's justified. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the right for not cooking because they were hurt by the MIL's actions. The answer would depend on whether the author's response is reasonable. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author is not under any obligation to cook, the answer is likely B.\n"
