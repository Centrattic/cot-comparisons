We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a cookout where the author's mother-in-law (MIL) complained about the meat not being cooked enough. The author decided not to cook for them again and has kept that vow for six years. The husband wants to move on, suggesting cooking for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't cook the meat, but the MIL asked her FIL (the author's father-in-law) if it was cooked enough, and he said yes. Then she took it back to the grill. The problem was that later, the MIL criticized the food in front of the husband, making him upset. The author then vowed not to cook for them again.\n\nThe question is whether holding a grudge for six years is wrong. The author argues that no one else had an issue with the food except the MIL, so it's a specific grievance. The husband wants to move past it, but the author is resistant. \n\nI think about forgiveness and whether holding onto this is justified. The author's stance is understandable because the MIL's criticism was harsh and public, affecting the husband's feelings. However, keeping a vow for six years might be seen as holding a grudge, which could strain family relationships. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking, but maybe the husband wants to repair relations. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author believes the MIL was unreasonable and it's a valid grievance, then it's not necessarily wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or family dynamics. Since the author has a good relationship otherwise, maybe it's not the author's fault. But some might argue that forgiveness is important for family harmony. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the MIL's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's reaction is a personal choice. However, the length of the grudge might be a factor. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author's actions are within their rights, then answer B (No).\n"
