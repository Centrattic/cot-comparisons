We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their mother-in-law (MIL) criticizing the cooking at a cookout years ago, leading the author to vow not to cook for them again. Now the husband is pushing for them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's MIL was the only one who had an issue with the meat, even though others ate it. She then criticized the food again later, causing their husband distress. The author has not cooked for them for six years as a result. They're being asked if they should let go of this grudge.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, the question is whether holding a grudge over this is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was the only one who had a problem, and they've maintained a good relationship otherwise. The husband wants to move on, but the author is resistant.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are whether the action is reasonable and if holding onto the resentment is fair. The MIL's behavior was clearly rude and hurtful, especially since the food was acceptable to others. The author's response\u2014refusing to cook for them\u2014might be seen as a personal choice, but holding a grudge for six years could be excessive. However, the author's decision not to cook again was a direct response to the MIL's actions, which were hurtful to the husband as well. \n\nBut the husband is now asking to move on, so there's a conflict between the author's feelings and the husband's desire to reconcile. The author's stance could be seen as holding onto a past grievance, which might be unfair to the husband and the MIL. However, the author feels justified because the MIL was the only one who criticized the food and continued to complain. \n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction was a way to protect their cooking and self-esteem. On the other hand, six years is a long time, and refusing to cook for family gatherings could affect the family dynamics, especially since the husband is involved. The author might be in the wrong for not letting go, but it's also understandable given the MIL's behavior. \n\nBut in AITA cases, the community often looks for whether the person's actions are proportionate. The author's refusal to cook is a personal choice, but holding a grudge for so long without communication might be seen as the problem. The answer could be AITA because the author hasn't addressed the issue directly with the MIL or the husband, just avoided cooking. So maybe the author is in the wrong for holding onto it for too long and not trying to resolve it. \n\nAlternatively, the MIL's initial behavior was the root cause. The author's decision not to cook is a passive-aggressive way to express their feelings, which might not be the healthiest approach. The husband's perspective is also important here; he might feel caught between his wife and his parents. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a response to a past hurt, but holding onto it for six years without addressing it might make them the AITA. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
