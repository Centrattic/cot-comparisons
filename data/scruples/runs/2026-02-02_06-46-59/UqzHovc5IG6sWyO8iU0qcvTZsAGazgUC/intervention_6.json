We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a conflict between the author and her mother-in-law (MIL) over a cookout incident several years ago. The author hasn't cooked for her in-laws since then and now her husband wants her to cook for Easter. She's considering whether she's at fault for holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The MIL didn't eat the meat at the cookout, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, he said yes, but she still griddled it. Later, the in-laws came to the husband's work, and the MIL criticized the food, leading to the husband feeling hurt. The author decided not to cook for them anymore as a vow. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, but the author is hesitant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or not. The key points to consider here are forgiveness, the severity of the incident, and the impact on relationships. \n\nThe author's main grievance is the MIL's public criticism and the resulting hurt to her husband. By vowing not to cook for them, she's using it as a form of punishment. But holding onto this for six years might be seen as holding a grudge. The husband is trying to move on, which suggests that the issue might have been resolved on his end. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that no one else had a problem with the food except the MIL, which makes her feel the criticism was unfair. The fact that the MIL didn't apologize and instead repeated her criticism adds to the author's hurt. The author's vow could be seen as a way to protect herself and her husband from future hurt, but it's been six years. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling hurt, but holding onto it for so long and refusing to cook for family could be seen as an unforgiving stance. The question is whether the author's refusal is a justified response or an overreach. \n\nConsidering that the husband is trying to reconcile and the author's actions are affecting family relationships, it might be that the author is in the wrong for not letting go. On the other hand, if the MIL's behavior was indeed hurtful and unapologetic, the author's stance might be understandable. But given the length of time and the husband's desire to move forward, the author's continued refusal could be seen as holding a grudge, hence being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because holding a six-year grudge and using cooking as a form of punishment without resolution might not be healthy or fair, especially if the family relationships are otherwise good. The author's actions might be more about personal satisfaction than about actual harm to the in-laws, so it's reasonable to say she's in the wrong for not moving on.\n"
