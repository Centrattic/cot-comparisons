We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout. The main issue seems to be the MIL's behavior during the cookout and afterward.\n\nFirst, the MIL didn't eat the food, questioned the cooking, and then took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then, days later, she criticized the food and blamed the husband when he confronted her. The author decided not to cook for them again, and it's been six years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nSo, the question is whether holding a grudge for six years over this incident is justified. The author argues that no one else had issues with the food, and the MIL's actions were particularly hurtful because of the public nature and the subsequent confrontation. However, the husband is pushing to move past it, suggesting forgiveness.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider both sides. The MIL's behavior was disrespectful and ungrateful, which is hurtful. The author's response of not cooking for them could be seen as a way to protect their feelings, but holding onto the grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The key factors here are the initial transgression and the length of the grudge.\n\nForgiveness is often a personal choice, but the author is maintaining a long-standing vow based on a past event. While the MIL's actions were wrong, the author's decision to withhold cooking for years might be seen as taking it too far, especially if it's causing current tension in the marriage. The husband is advocating for reconciliation, which is a common approach in family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified if they believe the MIL hasn't shown any remorse and that the husband is being too lenient. However, the author's own statement that the MIL hasn't noticed the change suggests that the grudge isn't affecting the MIL but is causing internal conflict within the marriage.\n\nIn many cases, holding onto past grievances can strain relationships. The author might need to consider if their stance is causing more harm than good, especially if the husband wants to move forward. The fact that the author has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise might mean that letting go of this specific issue could lead to a more harmonious family dynamic.\n\nSo, weighing both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong for not forgiving after such a long time, especially when it's affecting their relationship with the husband. The initial action by the MIL was wrong, but the prolonged refusal to forgive could be seen as the author's issue, not the MIL's. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
