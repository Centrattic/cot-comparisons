We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident years ago. The main event was a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, but the author refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate. She criticized the food in front of others and even took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then, she berated the husband later, which caused him distress. The husband tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. That's pretty harsh. So the initial action by the MIL was definitely wrong.\n\nThe author's response was to vow never to cook for them again. While holding a grudge for six years seems extreme, the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author isn't the one who wronged here; they were the victim. However, holding onto this grudge might be affecting the family dynamics now. The husband wants to move past it, but the author is holding on. \n\nThe key points are: the MIL's unkind actions, the husband's attempt to mediate without success, and the author's decision to stop cooking. The author's stance is understandable given the MIL's behavior. But maybe they could have found a way to move forward without letting it fester for so long. However, the MIL never apologized, so the author isn't obligated to forgive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't do anything wrong; they were reacting to being criticized and not respected. The MIL is the one at fault here. The author's refusal to cook is a form of self-protection, which isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that holding a grudge is a personal choice and not the author's fault. Since the MIL never apologized, the author isn't obligated to forgive, so the author is not in the wrong.\n"
