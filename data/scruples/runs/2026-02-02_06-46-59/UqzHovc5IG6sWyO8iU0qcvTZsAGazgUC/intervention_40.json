We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation is a bit about a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food and later criticized it, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, the husband wants to move on, but the author is holding a grudge for six years.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, said it wasn't cooked enough, then later criticized the food when dropping by the husband's work. The husband was upset, and the author vowed never to cook for them again. The MIL didn't apologize. The author is now being asked if they should let go and cook Easter dinner. They think other than this, the relationship is good, and maybe the MIL hasn't noticed the absence of meals.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A or B. So, the key points are whether the author's reaction is justified. The initial event might have been a minor issue, but the MIL's public criticism and lack of apology could have been hurtful. The author's response is to cut off cooking, which might be a form of punishment, even if years later. The husband is trying to move past it. \n\nBut is holding a grudge for six years reasonable? Maybe, if the hurt is still there. However, the author's decision affects the family dynamic. The question is about forgiveness. If the MIL didn't apologize, maybe the author isn't obligated to forgive. But keeping a vow for so long might be seen as the author's fault for not letting go. On the other hand, if the MIL was inconsiderate and disrespectful, the author's stance could be justified. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In some cases, holding a grudge over a minor issue might be seen as unnecessary. The cookout was a one-time event, and the MIL's behavior could have been a misunderstanding. The author's response is to stop cooking meals for them, which might be a significant reaction. Also, the husband is caught in the middle. The author's position might be seen as stubborn if there's no ongoing issue except this vow. \n\nBut the MIL didn't apologize, so maybe the author isn't wrong to not forgive. However, six years is a long time. Maybe the author is being unreasonable. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. Considering that, perhaps the answer is A. But I have to think if the author's actions are justified. If the MIL's actions were disrespectful and there was no apology, then the author's feelings are valid. However, the way the author is punishing the MIL by not cooking might be excessive. \n\nAlternatively, the author is protecting their feelings, so maybe not in the wrong. But the question is about forgiveness. The author is being asked if they should forgive and move on. The answer depends on whether the initial event was significant. The user's reasoning suggests that the author is in the wrong, so the answer would be A. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL was inconsiderate and there's no apology. \n\nHmm. The user's own conclusion is that the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to decide independently. Considering that holding a grudge for six years over a single incident might be excessive, and the author's response is a form of punishment without any indication of change from the MIL. However, the MIL's behavior was hurtful. The author's decision is a personal choice, but in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. If the author believes they were wronged and the other party hasn't apologized, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the author's reaction is disproportionate, then maybe they are. The key here is that the author is being asked if they should let go. If the answer is that the author is not in the wrong, then B. But the user thinks A. \n\nI'm a bit conflicted. The main issue is whether the author's refusal to cook is a valid response. Since the MIL's actions were hurtful and there was no apology, the author's stance could be justified. However, the length of time might make it seem like the author is holding a grudge unnecessarily. The answer could go either way. But according to the user's perspective, they think the author is in the wrong. So maybe the answer is A. But I need to make sure.\n"
