We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it, then later complained to their husband.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is upset because the MIL not only criticized the food but also took over grilling, which could have been a sensitive issue, especially if the food was actually undercooked. The author's husband was hurt by the MIL's comments and tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author then decided to stop cooking for them, and now the husband wants to move on and have a meal like Easter dinner. The author is conflicted about whether they're in the wrong for holding a grudge for six years.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving the MIL. To determine this, I need to consider the context. The MIL's actions might have been rude and unhelpful, especially after the cookout. Publicly criticizing the food and taking over isn't just about the food; it could be seen as undermining the hosts. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a reasonable boundary to avoid future hurt, but holding it for six years might be excessive unless there's an ongoing issue.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that they still have a good relationship otherwise, and the MIL might not even notice they stopped cooking. The husband wants to move on, which is understandable. But the author's stance is based on the MIL's unwillingness to apologize. In such cases, forgiveness doesn't always require reconciliation, but holding a grudge for years can affect relationships. The author's position isn't entirely in the wrong if they felt hurt and needed to set a boundary. However, the length of the grudge might be an issue. \n\nConsidering that the MIL didn't apologize and the author's husband is trying to mend things, it's possible the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their feelings. But the question is about being in the wrong for not forgiving. If the author's actions (not cooking) are a form of retaliation without resolution, maybe they are in the wrong. But since the MIL was the initial aggressor, the author's response might be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author has a valid reason for their hurt and setting boundaries is reasonable. However, holding onto it for six years without any attempt at resolution could be a point against them. But given the MIL's behavior, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving.\n"
