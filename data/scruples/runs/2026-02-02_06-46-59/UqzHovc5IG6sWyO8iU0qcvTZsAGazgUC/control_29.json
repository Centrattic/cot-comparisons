We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to a long-standing vow not to cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The MIL didn't eat the food at the cookout, even after the FIL confirmed it was cooked. She then re-cooked it. Later, she criticized the food and blamed the husband when she dropped by his work. The husband was upset, and the author stopped cooking for them as a result. They haven't cooked for the MIL in six years and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting cooking Easter dinner.\n\nSo, the main question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was especially hurtful because no one else had a problem with the food. The MIL's actions were harsh and unapologetic, which led the author to make a vow not to cook again. The husband now wants to move past it, but the author is conflicted.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, and the author has every right to feel upset. Holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized or made amends. On the other hand, the author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice to protect themselves and their husband's feelings. The fact that the husband is now asking to move on might mean the author should consider forgiveness, but only if the MIL shows remorse, which she hasn't. The author might also be justified in setting boundaries, especially if the MIL's actions were disrespectful.\n\nI need to check if the author's reaction is proportionate. The initial incident was a public criticism that hurt the husband, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them. Since the MIL hasn't apologized, the author's stance could be seen as reasonable. Holding a grudge isn't necessarily wrong if the other party hasn't shown any remorse. The author might be protecting their own feelings and their husband's by not engaging in something that causes stress.\n\nAlso, considering that the author has maintained a good relationship otherwise, this specific issue might not affect the overall relationship negatively. The author's husband is the one who is now pushing to move on, but the author might feel justified in not wanting to cook if it's a trigger.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries, especially after a hurtful experience without an apology. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
