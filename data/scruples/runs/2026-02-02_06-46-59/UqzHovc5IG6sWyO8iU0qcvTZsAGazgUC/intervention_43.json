We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and took it upon herself to re-cook it. The author has since vowed not to cook for them again, and now their husband is pressuring them to move on and cook an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's actions were to question the cooking and then take it upon herself to re-cook it. The FIL initially said the meat was cooked, but the MIL still re-cooked it. Then a few days later, she criticized the food and the husband had to walk away. The author is upset about this and hasn't cooked for them in years. The husband wants to move on, but the author is resisting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The MIL's behavior does seem harsh. Criticizing the food and making a scene, then later not apologizing could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author has held a grudge for six years and is now refusing to cook for them, which might affect family relationships. The author's husband is caught in the middle, trying to mend things.\n\nBut the MIL's actions were disrespectful. The author's response is to cut off cooking for them, which might be a form of punishment. The author might be justified in feeling hurt, but holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. However, the author is also trying to protect their husband from the MIL's criticism. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about proportionality. If the MIL's actions were wrong, then the author's response might be justified. But holding a grudge for so long and impacting family relations could tip the balance. The author might not be in the wrong if the MIL's behavior was indeed inconsiderate and the author's actions are self-respect. But maybe the author should consider forgiveness and moving on for the sake of the family. Alternatively, the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n\nHmm. The key factors are the severity of the MIL's actions versus the duration and impact of the author's response. If the MIL's actions were a one-time issue and the author has been punishing them for years, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the MIL's actions were particularly hurtful and the author is maintaining boundaries, then it's not the author's fault. Also, the fact that the author hasn't noticed the MIL's absence in meals suggests that maybe the author's punishment isn't affecting the MIL, so there's no harm. But the author is causing tension in the marriage by not compromising. The husband wants to move on, so the author's refusal could be affecting the relationship.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because holding onto a grudge for six years is excessive and causing marital strain. The author's actions are affecting their husband and potentially the broader family dynamics. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response is disproportionate.\n"
