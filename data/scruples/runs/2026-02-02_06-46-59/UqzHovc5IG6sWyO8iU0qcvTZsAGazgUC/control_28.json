We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident years ago. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and husband made a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked, then took it back to grill. Later, she criticized the food at their son's work and blamed the author, leading the husband to be upset. The author then vowed not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook Easter dinner. The author is conflicted, thinking that maybe the MIL didn't notice the lack of cooking and that the relationship is otherwise good.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial conflict, the MIL's harsh criticism, the husband's reaction, and the author's long-standing decision not to cook. The question is about whether holding a grudge for six years is wrong, especially when the husband is pushing for reconciliation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness is often encouraged, but it's not always straightforward. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a boundary to protect their feelings. However, holding onto a grudge for such a long time might affect the family dynamics and the husband's desire for a better relationship with his parents. \n\nThe MIL's actions were clearly hurtful and inappropriate. Criticizing the food in front of others and then making a scene at the son's workplace is unkind. The author's response\u2014refusing to cook\u2014is a way to avoid further conflict. But the husband is now suggesting moving past it, which could mean the author is being asked to make a gesture of goodwill.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to protect their feelings and set boundaries. However, the question is whether holding this grudge is the right approach. Some might argue that letting go would improve family relations, but others might agree with the author's stance. \n\nConsidering the context, the author's actions are a personal choice to avoid conflict. The husband's request to cook for Easter might be an opportunity to rebuild, but if the author feels it's unnecessary, their position is valid. The answer hinges on balancing personal feelings with family expectations. Since the author hasn't caused harm but is maintaining a boundary, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
