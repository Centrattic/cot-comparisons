We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the user and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, questioned the doneness, and later criticized the food, leading to the husband being upset. The author decided not to cook for them again, and now the husband wants to move on and have them cook Easter. The author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, the MIL's actions: She didn't eat the food, took it back to the grill, then later criticized the food harshly. That's pretty harsh, especially after the cookout. The FIL said the meat was cooked, but she still took it back. The MIL's criticism was after the event and in a way that hurt the husband. The author's reaction is to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the MIL's behavior versus the author's response. The MIL was ungrateful and harsh. The author's punishment is cutting off cooking for them, which affects the in-laws but the author claims they haven't noticed. The husband is pushing to move on.\n\nIs holding a grudge for six years justified? The author feels justified because no one else had a problem except the MIL. But maybe the length of time is an issue. However, the MIL never apologized, so the author might feel validated in their stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's husband is advocating for moving on. The author is being asked if they should cook Easter dinner. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to cook for them because of past hurt, but others might see it as holding a grudge too long. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, sometimes family drama is expected to be forgiven. However, the MIL's actions were unkind and unapologetic. The author's response is a personal choice based on hurt feelings. So, the answer might depend on whether the punishment fits the offense. The author isn't harming anyone else, just not cooking. But maybe the husband is caught in the middle. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The MIL was at fault, and the author is protecting their feelings. The decision to stop cooking is a personal boundary. Unless there's a significant negative impact on others, the author isn't wrong. The answer is B.\n"
