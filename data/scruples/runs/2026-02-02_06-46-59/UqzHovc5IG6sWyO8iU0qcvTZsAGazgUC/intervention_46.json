We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They want to know if they should forgive their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout for the family. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, and then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL dropped by the husband's work and criticized the food, leading to the husband getting upset. The author decided not to cook for the MIL again, which has lasted for six years. Now the husband wants to move on and cook Easter dinner, but the author refuses. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nSo, to evaluate, I need to consider several factors. The initial incident: the MIL didn't eat the meat because she thought it wasn't cooked enough. Maybe it was undercooked, or maybe she's just picky. Then, the FIL said it was cooked, but she still took it to the grill. Then, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, which hurt him. The author stopped cooking for them as a result.\n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for not forgiving the MIL after six years. The key points here are the timeline, the significance of the event, and the author's decision to hold a grudge for years because of a single incident that may not have been as serious as they thought.\n\nThe author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, so the issue was specifically with the MIL. The husband tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author's vow to never cook again is a significant action, as it affects their relationship with the in-laws.\n\nI need to determine if holding a grudge for six years over this is reasonable. The author's reasoning is that they're not cooking for others because of this one incident, but the husband wants to move on. The author also mentions that maybe the in-laws haven't noticed the change, which adds another layer\u2014maybe the author is overthinking it.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, holding a grudge for such a long time might be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL's actions were not malicious. The author's decision to cut off cooking for them entirely might be seen as a punishment for a past event, which could be considered unfair if the MIL hasn't shown any remorse or if the issue was minor. However, the MIL did criticize the husband publicly, which could have been hurtful, so the author's stance might be understandable.\n\nBut considering that six years is a long time, and the author's husband is trying to move forward, the author might be the one holding onto the past unnecessarily. The question is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. If the MIL's actions were a one-time issue and she didn't apologize, maybe the author has a right to be upset. However, not cooking for them for years might be seen as taking it too far, especially if there's no ongoing issues with the MIL otherwise.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they have a good relationship with the MIL otherwise, so maybe the issue is resolved in other areas. The fact that the author hasn't had to confront the MIL about it again suggests that maybe the problem isn't ongoing. Therefore, holding onto this for six years without any further incidents might be seen as the author's fault for not letting go.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often advise moving on from past conflicts unless there's a pattern of behavior. Since this was a single incident, the author might be overreacting. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong for holding a grudge for so long without any new issues arising, especially if the MIL hasn't done anything else to warrant it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for six years over a past incident that hasn't repeated, especially when it's affecting their relationship with the husband, might be seen as unreasonable. The author could be advised to forgive and move on, even if the MIL didn't apologize, because the situation has changed and there's no current conflict.\n"
