We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her FIL if it was cooked enough, then later took it back to the grill. Then, the MIL criticized the food and her FIL when she visited the husband at work, leading to him being upset. The author then stopped cooking for the in-laws, and it's been 6 years. Now the husband wants to move on, and they're considering cooking for Easter.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for holding onto this grudge. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong, so I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's actions were hurtful. She criticized the food in front of others and didn't apologize. The husband was hurt, and the author decided not to cook for them again as a result. The author might feel justified in protecting their feelings and the husband's feelings. They mention that the husband is okay cooking grilled food but not others, so they don't want to cook a big meal. Also, they think the in-laws haven't noticed, so the author isn't causing harm.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years seems excessive. The author might be letting a past event affect their relationship unnecessarily. The husband is moving on, and the author's refusal to cook could be seen as holding onto resentment. The MIL's actions were inappropriate, but the author's response is to cut off cooking for years, which might be seen as holding a grudge without closure or communication.\n\nI need to consider whether the author's actions are reasonable. Forgiveness can be personal, but refusing to cook for six years without any sign that the MIL has apologized might be seen as holding a vendetta. The author might be maintaining a grudge when the in-laws might not even be aware of it. Also, the author says they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe moving past this would be healthier.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's decision to not cook for six years is a significant punishment for a past event where the MIL didn't apologize. The author's husband wants to move on, which is a positive step, but the author is resisting. The author's actions could be seen as holding a grudge, which might make them at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because holding onto this for so long without any resolution or communication is unreasonable.\n"
