We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation revolves around a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food, had her husband check if it was cooked, then later criticized the food when the in-laws visited the husband at work. The author stopped cooking for them after that, holding a grudge for six years, and now the husband wants to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The problem started with the cookout. The MIL didn't eat and then later complained. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which affected their relationship. The husband is now urging to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe author's stance is that they think they are in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior might be seen as inconsiderate. She didn't eat during the cookout and then later criticized the food, which upset the husband. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a form of self-defense, especially if the MIL's comments were harsh and unapologetic. The author might feel disrespected and want to protect their feelings and efforts in cooking.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years over an incident that might have been a minor misunderstanding could be seen as excessive. The author is not cooking for the MIL and FIL anymore, which could be a personal choice, but maybe it's affecting the family dynamics. The husband is trying to move past it, which suggests he might see this as a way to improve relations. The author might be avoiding a potential conflict by not cooking, but perhaps the FIL was just being honest or had different tastes, and the author's response is overly harsh. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, so maybe the MIL was the only one who was critical. However, the fact that the MIL took the meat back to the grill implies she could have adjusted it herself. The author might be taking the criticism personally, even if it wasn't intended that way. \n\nIn terms of forgiveness, there's a difference between being hurt and holding a grudge. The author stopped cooking entirely, which seems like a significant action. If the MIL hasn't apologized, it's understandable that the author is upset. But after six years, maybe it's time to consider if this grudge is still valid or if it's causing more harm than good. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's decision to stop cooking is based on a valid reason (disrespectful comments) and they haven't received an apology, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the author is using this as a way to avoid dealing with potential future issues or to take revenge, then maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author is now being asked to cook for an Easter dinner. The MIL hasn't apologized, so the author might feel justified in not cooking. But the husband is trying to move forward. The author's reasoning is that their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, except for this incident. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are proportionate. The initial criticism was a hurtful event, but holding it for six years and refusing to cook might be seen as excessive. The author's husband is trying to mend the situation, and the author is resisting, which could be affecting the family. However, the author's feelings are valid, and the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they have a right to feel hurt and to set boundaries based on disrespectful treatment. The MIL's actions were unkind, and the author's response is a way to protect their own feelings. But if the author is holding onto the grudge despite the possibility of reconciliation, it might be a different story. However, the scenario doesn't mention any attempts by the MIL to apologize, so the author's stance is defensible.\n"
