We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to tension. The author stopped cooking for their in-laws since then and is now being asked by their husband to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat at the cookout, asked her husband if it was cooked enough (he said yes), then later cooked it again. Then a few days later, she criticized the food at their son's work, leading to the husband being upset. The author took this as a personal attack and stopped cooking for them. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the MIL's behavior was inappropriate. She criticized the food in front of her son, which could be hurtful. But the author's reaction is holding a grudge for six years. That's a long time. The author hasn't cooked for them, which might affect the in-laws' experience, but they mention that the in-laws might not even notice. The author also says they have a good relationship otherwise.\n\nIs holding a grudge for six years justified? The initial incident might have been a valid reason for hurt feelings, but not forgiving for such a long time could be seen as the author's fault. The MIL's actions were rude, but the author's response is cutting off a family tradition without clear resolution. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, which suggests that maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author doesn't mention trying to address the issue with the MIL since then. They just stopped cooking. That could be seen as passive-aggressive. If the author is holding onto this without communication, maybe that's not healthy. The husband might feel caught between two people, wanting to reconcile but not wanting to cook himself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could hinge on the duration of the grudge and the lack of effort to resolve the issue. The MIL's behavior was wrong, but the author's response might be excessive. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they've held onto this for so long without addressing it, affecting family relations unnecessarily.\n"
