We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, questioned the doneness, then later criticized the food and the husband's cooking. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author decided to stop cooking for the in-laws and has kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about cooking for Easter.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's stance is understandable because the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a boundary to protect their feelings. However, holding a grudge for six years might affect family relationships. The husband's perspective is that they should move past it, which is reasonable for maintaining family harmony. \n\nBut the author hasn't cut off the in-laws entirely; they have a good relationship otherwise. The key points are: the MIL's behavior was rude and unkind, the author's reaction is a personal choice, and the husband is trying to reconcile. \n\nIs the author wrong for not forgiving? It depends on whether holding onto this grudge is necessary. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking anymore; maybe the MIL hasn't noticed. However, the husband wants to move forward, so there's a conflict between personal feelings and family unity. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at proportionality. The author's action (not cooking) isn't hurting others, but holding onto an old grudge might not be fair. The MIL's actions were indeed harsh, but the author's response (a six-year vow) is extreme. Maybe the author is justified in their feelings but the duration is an issue. However, since the author is content with their decision and the husband is handling his part, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are seen as unreasonable. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the MIL was at fault, holding a grudge for six years without any resolution might be excessive. The author could choose to set boundaries without letting it consume them for so long. It's possible they're not wrong entirely, but the question is about if they are in the wrong. Given the context, the author's decision to not cook could be seen as reasonable, but the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" If the author's actions are causing unnecessary strain on the marriage, then perhaps they are. However, since the husband is willing to handle it by cooking, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm, this is tricky. I might lean towards A because the author is holding onto a grudge, but maybe not. Alternatively, since the MIL was the one who caused the hurt and didn't apologize, the author isn't wrong for not forgiving her. So maybe B. Wait, the user thinks the author is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The author is holding a grudge for six years. The husband is trying to move on, so the author's refusal to cook might be causing marital tension. The author could be in the wrong for not letting go and focusing on past hurt. However, if the author is content and the husband is handling it, maybe not. The answer could be B (not wrong) because they have the right to protect their feelings. But if the grudge is affecting the marriage, then A. The key is whether the author's actions are unreasonable. Since they haven't cut ties and the husband is okay with cooking, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
