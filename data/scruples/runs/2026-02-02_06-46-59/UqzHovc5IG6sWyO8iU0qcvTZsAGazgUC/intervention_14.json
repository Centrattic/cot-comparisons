We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook again, but she's holding onto the grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's MIL made a comment about the food after a cookout, which upset the husband. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore. The key points here are the initial incident's impact, the duration of the grudge (6 years), and the current situation where the husband wants to move past it.\n\nThe author argues that no one else had issues except the MIL, so the criticism was unfair. But holding a grudge for six years seems excessive. The author's vow to never cook for them again might be affecting the family relationship. The husband is caught in the middle, feeling the need to mediate. \n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions\u2014criticizing the food in front of others, then later complaining to her son\u2014could be seen as harsh. The author's response was to stop cooking, which might be a valid reaction to being criticized unfairly. However, the length of time is a factor. Letting go after six years might be necessary for family harmony. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the MIL was in the wrong initially, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not reconciling. But if the author's refusal to cook is causing ongoing issues and the husband is trying to mend things, the author might be the one holding onto past hurt unnecessarily. \n\nConsidering the situation, the author's decision to not cook for six years could be seen as holding a grudge. Even if the initial incident wasn't their fault, not making an effort to move on might be in the wrong. The husband is trying to bridge the gap, and the author's refusal could hinder that. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because holding onto resentment for that long is problematic, even if the initial issue wasn't their fault.\n"
