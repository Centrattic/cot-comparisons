We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mother-in-law (MIL) criticizing the food at a cookout they hosted, even though the MIL didn't eat it and later grilling her own meat. The author then stopped cooking for them for six years and is now being asked by her husband to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, questioned the FIL, then re-grilled it. Later, the MIL criticized the food at the cookout, even though she didn't eat it, which upset the husband. The author vowed not to cook for them again, and now the husband wants to move on. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nHmm. The author's actions are based on the MIL's criticism after the cookout. The author's reasoning is that the MIL didn't eat the food initially, then complained about the quality. The author might feel it's unfair that after putting in effort, the MIL is ungrateful and undermines the experience. The vow to stop cooking could be seen as a justified response if the author believes their effort was disrespected. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is asking the author to forgive and move on. The author's husband was hurt by the MIL's comment, which the author might be trying to support by not cooking. But the author's action has lasted a long time, and it's affecting their relationship now. The author is considering if they should cook Easter dinner. The MIL might not even notice the lack of cooking, so maybe the author is the one holding onto it unnecessarily.\n\nFrom a typical \"AITA\" perspective, the \"wrongdoing\" usually involves a clear boundary violation or hurtful action. The MIL's behavior could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially since she didn't eat the food but still criticized it. The author's response of not cooking again might be a passive-aggressive way of dealing with the issue. However, since the author is the one who is still holding onto the grievance and the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe the author isn't the asshole. But keeping a grudge for six years is a long time, which could be seen as extreme. \n\nI should consider if the author's reaction is proportionate. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, but the author's response is to cut off cooking for them, which affects the husband. The husband is trying to move on, so the author's refusal might be straining their relationship. The author might need to evaluate if their vow is still serving them or if it's better to let go for the sake of the marriage. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the MIL's behavior was inappropriate. However, the duration of the grudge might be a point to consider. But in AITA cases, the focus is on who was wrong in the situation, not necessarily on the length of the grudge. The author's stance is about respecting their effort and not letting the MIL's behavior affect them. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author's reaction is a form of self-respect, the author might be justified. So the answer is B.\n"
