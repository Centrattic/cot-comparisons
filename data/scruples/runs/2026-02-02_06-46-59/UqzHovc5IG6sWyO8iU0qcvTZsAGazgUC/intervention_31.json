We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author and their husband hosted a cookout for their in-laws. The MIL found the meat not cooked enough, had her FIL confirm, then re-cooked it. Later, she criticized the food and told the husband she had to grill it herself, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them again, and even now, after six years, the husband wants to move on.\n\nThe key points here are: the MIL's behavior during and after the cookout, the husband's hurt feelings, and the author's ongoing refusal to cook for them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's stance is that the MIL was ungrateful and hurt their husband, so they're justified in holding a grudge. The husband wants to move past it. The author argues that the MIL's criticism was unfounded since no one else had issues, and they haven't noticed the refusal to cook for them. However, holding a grudge for six years is a long time. The author's decision affects the husband's family relationship, which he might be prioritizing over the author's feelings. \n\nForgiveness and moving on are important for family harmony. The author's vow to not cook again might be a way to protect themselves from hurt, but it's also impacting the husband's ability to mend ties with his parents. The question is whether holding onto this grudge is reasonable. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's actions were indeed inconsiderate and hurtful. On the other, not letting go of such a grudge for years could be seen as holding onto resentment unnecessarily. The author might need to find a middle ground\u2014maybe cooking a meal without taking it personally, or finding a way to reconcile without feeling resentful. \n\nBut the author's reasoning (that no one else had issues with the food) might not fully justify the long-term refusal. Also, the husband's desire to move on suggests that the author's stance is affecting their relationship. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the husband's perspective and for maintaining a grudge for so long. However, it's also understandable given the MIL's behavior. \n\nIn the end, forgiveness is a personal choice, but holding onto anger for years could be seen as the author's fault if it's affecting family relationships. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A). But I need to be careful here. If the author is protecting themselves from a toxic MIL, it's different. But the MIL hasn't shown any other toxic behavior besides this incident. The author might be overreacting by not letting go. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for six years without any apparent effort to reconcile, especially when the husband is trying to move on, and considering that the MIL's actions were a one-time issue, it's reasonable to expect the author to let it go for the sake of family relations. However, this is a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
