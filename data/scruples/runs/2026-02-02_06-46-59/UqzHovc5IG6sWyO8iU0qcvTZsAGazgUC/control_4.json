We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past cookout incident where the MIL criticized the food and made the author's husband feel bad. The author has stopped cooking for them since then and is now being asked to cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food initially, then grilled it herself, and later criticized the meal, leading to the husband being upset. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nNow, considering the context. The MIL's criticism was harsh and public, and she didn't apologize. The author's vow not to cook again is a form of retaliation, which is understandable given the hurt caused. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author mentions that other family members didn't have issues with the food, which adds to the validity of their frustration.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's response, while long-standing, is a personal choice. However, holding onto this for six years might affect family dynamics. The husband wants reconciliation, and the author is being asked if they should comply. The author argues that the MIL hasn't noticed the change, so maybe it's not causing current harm. \n\nBut is it right to hold a grudge for so long? Some might say forgiveness is important for family harmony. Others might argue that the author isn't obligated to cook if they're hurt. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the original incident was a valid point (no one else had issues), the author's stance might be justified. However, maintaining a vow for six years could be seen as holding onto resentment unnecessarily. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is reasonable. If the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and there's no reconciliation, the author isn't in the wrong for not cooking. But if the husband's desire to move on is valid and the author's stance is causing unnecessary tension, maybe they are. However, given the MIL's lack of apology and the husband's initial hurt, the author's position seems defensible. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
