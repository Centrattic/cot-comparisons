We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a cookout incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and later complained to the husband at work. The husband was upset, and the author stopped cooking for the MIL's family. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is holding the grudge.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong here. Let's break it down. The MIL's behavior seems unkind. She didn't eat the food initially, then criticized it later, which hurt the husband. The author took a stand by not cooking again, which might be seen as a coping mechanism. But holding a grudge for six years is a long time. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe key points: The MIL's actions were inappropriate, and the author didn't cook for them, possibly to avoid similar situations. The husband wants reconciliation, but the author is resistant. The author mentions that others didn't have an issue with the food, so the problem was specific to the MIL. \n\nBut is not cooking for six years a reasonable response? Maybe the author is prioritizing their own feelings over family harmony. However, the MIL hasn't apologized, so the author might feel there's no reason to reconcile. The author also mentions they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the grudge isn't affecting other interactions. \n\nHowever, holding onto something for so long could be seen as inconsiderate of the husband's wishes and possibly harming extended family relations. The author's stance is about self-respect, not cooking for someone who criticized them. But is that a valid reason? It depends on perspective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for feeling hurt, but holding a grudge for years might not be the healthiest approach. However, the MIL's behavior was uncalled for. The answer might hinge on whether the author's response is proportionate. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the MIL's actions were poor, and the author is justified in protecting their feelings. But maybe some would argue that the author should let go for the husband's sake. However, the author isn't causing harm except to the MIL, who hasn't acknowledged their mistake. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
