We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where the MIL criticized a cookout. The author stopped cooking for them after that and is now being asked by their husband to move on and cook for Easter.\n\nFirst, the key points: The MIL didn't eat the meat, questioned the cooking, then later criticized the food and took it upon herself to grill it. The author's husband was upset because the MIL didn't apologize and kept her criticism. The author vowed not to cook for them again, which they've maintained for six years. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The author's stance is a vow to never cook for the MIL again because of a minor incident that seems to have been a misunderstanding. The MIL didn't eat the meat and then later took the opportunity to grill it, which might have been a way to help. However, the author's husband felt hurt by the criticism, and the author's response was a long-term boycott of cooking. \n\nIs holding a grudge for six years over an incident that seems to be resolved (no one else had issues with the food, and the problem was the MIL's specific preference) reasonable? The author's husband is asking to move on, which suggests that the issue might not be as significant now as it was. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to cook for someone who criticized their cooking, but the MIL's action was a one-time event. \n\nThe author's action of not cooking could be seen as a way to assert control or teach a lesson, but it's been six years. Holding onto this might be seen as unnecessary, especially if the relationship is otherwise good. The author might be prioritizing their own feelings over reconciliation, which could be considered immature or petty. However, it's also their right to set boundaries based on their experiences. \n\nThe question is whether the author's response is disproportionate. The answer might depend on cultural norms, the significance of the cooking in their relationship, and whether the MIL's actions were indeed a valid concern. Since the author's husband is now asking to move on, and the author is considering whether to comply, the author's decision to hold a grudge might be the issue here. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's decision to not cook again was a response to a specific incident. The MIL's criticism might have been unwarranted, but the author's long-term boycott could be seen as holding a grudge. The husband's side is that it's time to move on, which could indicate that the author is being too rigid. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not forgiving and moving on after so long, especially if the MIL hasn't made amends but the author's husband is trying to mend the relationship. However, the author might feel justified in their actions based on their past hurt. \n\nBut considering the six-year span, the author's stance might be seen as in the wrong because holding onto this for that long without any indication of reconciliation from the MIL might be unreasonable. The author could be seen as choosing their own pride over their husband's wishes and potentially a better relationship with the in-laws. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure.\n"
