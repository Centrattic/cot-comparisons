We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked if it was cooked enough, and then when her FIL said it was, she took it back to grill more. Then, the in-laws came to the husband's work a few days later, and the MIL criticized the food, saying it was terrible and she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset and walked away. The author stopped cooking for them since then and is now being asked by her husband to move on, specifically to cook Easter dinner. They're wondering if they're the a**hole for holding this grudge.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are: the author is holding a grudge for six years over a cookout where the MIL was critical. The author's husband is trying to move past it, and the author is refusing to cook again, possibly out of spite or to show the MIL what they think of her comments. The author claims that no one else complained except the MIL, which might have made the situation more hurtful because it felt like the only criticism.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified. Let's break it down. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and possibly rude. She made the husband feel upset by publicly criticizing the food. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. That's a long time. The question is whether holding a grudge for that long is reasonable.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's actions were inappropriate. Dismissing the effort someone put into cooking, especially when others didn't have a problem, could be seen as unfair. The author's decision to not cook again might be a way to protect their feelings or set a boundary. On the other hand, holding onto this for six years could be considered unkind or excessive. Relationships often require forgiveness and moving past old conflicts, especially if the author otherwise has a good relationship with their in-laws.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they can't even remember the exact time frame, which might indicate that the hurt has lingered. The husband's request to move on suggests that he wants to mend the situation or avoid future tension. The author's stance could be affecting family dynamics, even if the MIL hasn't noticed the change. But if the author is content and the MIL hasn't reached out to apologize, maybe it's not about the author's feelings but about the principle of not forgiving.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the balance between the wrong done and the response. If the author's response is disproportionate, they might be in the wrong. However, if they feel the MIL's actions were disrespectful and they're choosing to set boundaries, that could be justified. The key factors here are the duration of the grudge, the impact on family relationships, and whether the author's actions are a reasonable response.\n\nThe MIL's criticism was direct and hurtful, but the author's punishment of not cooking for six years is a significant action. The author might be right to feel upset, but holding the grudge this long and refusing to cook Easter dinner could be seen as stubborn. The husband is trying to move forward, which is a positive step, and the author might need to consider whether their actions are helping or hindering the relationship.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the MIL's behavior was clearly the initial problem. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for six years is too long. But given that the author is maintaining boundaries and the MIL hasn't apologized, the author's position could be justified. The answer is B (No).\n"
