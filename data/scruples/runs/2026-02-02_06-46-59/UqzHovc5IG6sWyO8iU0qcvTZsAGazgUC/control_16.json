We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The key points are:\n\n1. A cookout where the MIL didn't like the food and took it back to cook. The husband was upset when his MIL criticized the food and told him he had to walk away. The author vowed never to cook for them again, which they've kept for years.\n\n2. The husband now wants to move on and have the author cook Easter dinner. The author is reluctant, thinking the in-laws might not even notice they haven't been served before.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. \n\nFirst, the MIL's actions: She took it upon herself to grill more, which isn't a huge issue. Then, she criticized the food in front of the husband and made him walk away. The husband felt hurt, so he confronted her, but she didn't apologize. The author then decided not to cook for them again. \n\nIs holding a grudge for six years over this justified? The author's reasoning is that the criticism was unfair, especially since others didn't have issues. The MIL's behavior was harsh and possibly disrespectful. The author's response\u2014refusing to cook\u2014is their way of not engaging with that criticism.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband wants to move on. The author is considering if they're being too harsh. The argument for the author not being in the wrong is that the MIL's actions were hurtful and the author is setting boundaries. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the relationship is otherwise good. \n\nBut, if the author's decision is about self-respect and not allowing someone to belittle their efforts, maybe it's justified. The key is whether the grudge is affecting their relationship negatively. The author mentions the relationship is good otherwise. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' behaviors. The MIL was inconsiderate, but the author's response is extreme. However, the author is maintaining their stance for personal reasons. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the MIL initiated the conflict, and the author is setting boundaries. But some might argue that holding a grudge that long is inconsiderate. However, given the context and the husband's desire to move on, the author isn't necessarily wrong. So I think B is the right choice.\n"
