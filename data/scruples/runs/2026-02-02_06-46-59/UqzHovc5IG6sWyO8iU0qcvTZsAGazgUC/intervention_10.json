We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident years ago.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a family cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore. Now, the husband wants to move past it, but the author is still holding onto this grudge.\n\nThe author thinks they might be in the wrong but is unsure. The user, however, believes the author is in the wrong and wants to confirm.\n\nSo, the key points here are about forgiveness, holding onto past grievances, and family dynamics. The author hasn't cooked for the MIL for years, which the husband is now urging to change. The question is whether the author's refusal is justified or if they should let go of the past.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions (not cooking) are excessive or if the MIL's behavior was indeed unacceptable. The MIL's criticism led to the husband feeling hurt, and the author's vow not to cook seems like a personal choice. However, holding a grudge for six years over a single incident might be seen as harsh. The author's decision isn't causing harm to others, but it's affecting family relations. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and disrespectful. On the other, the author's response of cutting off cooking for years could be seen as a disproportionate reaction. The author might be punishing the MIL and husband for something that happened in the past. The husband's current push to move on might be valid, as holding onto this could hinder family harmony. \n\nBut the author's feelings are valid too. If they're still hurt, it's their right to set boundaries. However, if the MIL hasn't acknowledged her part and there's no resolution, the author's stance could be justified. Still, not cooking for several years might be a long time, especially if the author is choosing not to engage in family meals out of spite. The answer would depend on whether the author's reaction is reasonable given the situation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often expect the wrong to be on the person who acted out of proportion. If the MIL was inconsiderate, but the author's response is extreme, that might make the author at fault. However, if the author's actions are a reasonable boundary, then they might not be in the wrong. The key here is the length of the grudge and the impact on family relations. \n\nI think the author's refusal to cook for six years is an overreaction. Even if the MIL was wrong, holding onto it for so long without communication or resolution might be holding a grudge. The author's husband is trying to move on, which is a good sign. The author could consider whether their actions are helping or hindering their relationship with the husband and MIL. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for holding onto this for so long. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
