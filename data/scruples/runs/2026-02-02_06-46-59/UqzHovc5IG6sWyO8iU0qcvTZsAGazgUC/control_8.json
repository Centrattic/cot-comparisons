We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the mother-in-law (MIL) criticizing the cookout food and then later grilling the meat herself. The author and her husband stopped cooking for the MIL after that, and the husband wants to move on. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the MIL's actions were pretty inconsiderate. She didn't eat the food at first, then later took it upon herself to re-cook it, and then criticized the meal to her son. That's hurtful, especially because the author and husband put effort into the cookout. The husband was clearly upset and tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize.\n\nThe author decided not to cook for them again as a result. That's a personal choice. Holding a grudge for six years might be a long time, but the MIL's behavior was unkind. The author isn't obligated to forgive someone who was unreasonable. Also, the husband is the one who wants to move on, but the author is standing by her decision. The key point is whether the author's refusal to cook is justified. Since the MIL was the one who caused the hurt, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding onto that. Plus, the author mentions that they have a good relationship otherwise, so this isn't a complete breakdown. The answer might be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
