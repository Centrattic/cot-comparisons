We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it, then later complained to the husband. The author has since stopped cooking for them, and now the husband wants to move on, especially for an upcoming Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL's actions: during the cookout, she didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough (he said yes), then went back to grill it more. Then a few days later, she criticized the food and told the husband it was terrible, which upset him. The author decided to stop cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband wants to move past it, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. She didn't eat the food, then criticized it later, which hurt the husband's feelings. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which might be a way to protect their own feelings and avoid further conflict. If the MIL didn't apologize and continued to be critical, the author might feel justified in their stance. Also, if the MIL hasn't noticed the change, maybe it's not affecting their relationship. The author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe this isn't the main issue.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. Forgiveness and moving on can be important for family harmony. The husband wants to move forward, so the author might be causing unnecessary tension by not complying with his wishes. Even if the author isn't cooking again, maybe participating in a holiday dinner (like Easter) could help mend any lingering issues or show goodwill. The user might think that the author is being too rigid and not considering the husband's feelings now.\n\nBut then again, the author's decision to stop cooking was a personal choice. They might see it as a way to protect themselves from hurt. If the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe the author isn't obligated to forgive. Relationships involve boundaries, and the author might be setting a boundary they feel is necessary. The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. If the incident was significant and there's no apology, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is now causing unnecessary strain by refusing to cook for a holiday, maybe they are. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the reasons.\n\nIn the end, the author made a personal choice to stop cooking, which they can maintain. Unless there's harm to others, maybe it's not the author's fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the husband's feelings are being harmed now, maybe the author should consider that. Hmm.\n"
