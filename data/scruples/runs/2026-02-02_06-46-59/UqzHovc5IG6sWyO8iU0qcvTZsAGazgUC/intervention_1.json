We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not cooking for her in-laws after an incident six years ago. The situation involves the author's mother-in-law criticizing the food at a cookout, then later complaining to the husband. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and now her husband wants her to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate\u2014publicly criticizing the food, even though no one else had a problem. The husband was hurt and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. Now the husband wants her to cook again, but she's resistant, partly because she doesn't think the MIL has noticed the change.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but I need to decide based on the situation. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. The MIL's actions were hurtful, but the author's response is affecting her relationship with her husband. However, she also has a right to be upset by the criticism and the lack of an apology. The fact that she hasn't cooked for them for so long might make it awkward to suddenly resume, especially if the MIL hasn't acknowledged the issue. \n\nBut holding onto a grudge for six years might be seen as unfair, especially if the MIL hasn't made any effort to reconcile. The author could be making things harder on herself and her husband. Also, the husband's feelings might be important here\u2014he's trying to move past the conflict, and the author's refusal could strain their marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has every right to protect her feelings and set boundaries. If she's not willing to cook for them, that's her choice, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized. The fact that the MIL hasn't noticed the cessation suggests that maybe the author's actions are more about her own feelings than the MIL's. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The key factors are the length of the hold grudge and the impact on the marriage. If she's causing unnecessary stress by holding onto this, then yes, she's in the wrong. However, if she's justified in her feelings because the MIL hasn't taken responsibility, then she might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because the MIL's actions were the initial problem, and the author has been consistent in her boundary. However, holding onto it for six years without any attempt at reconciliation might be seen as her being in the wrong. But it's a balance between her right to her feelings and the husband's desire to move on. \n\nWait, but the husband is the one who was directly affected by the MIL's comments. The author's vow to stop cooking is her way of coping. If the husband is now asking her to cook, maybe she should consider his feelings as well. But if she's still hurt, then maybe it's okay. \n\nHmm. In the end, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL's actions were the catalyst, and the author is within her rights to set boundaries. However, some might argue that not cooking for six years is too long. But given the MIL's lack of apology, the author's stance is understandable. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
