We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law. The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later confronted the husband, leading to the author vowing not to cook for them again. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's actions seem pretty harsh. She not only criticized the food in front of others but also took it upon herself to grill it again. Then, she went to the husband at work to complain, which is pretty unkind. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now, the husband is pushing to move on, and the author is hesitant.\n\nThe author's stance is that the MIL was wrong, and she's holding a grudge. The question is whether she's in the wrong for holding this grudge for six years. On one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized. But the author's reasoning is that this was a unique situation where no one else had a problem, and the MIL's actions were particularly cruel.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around forgiveness, family dynamics, and whether holding a grudge is justified here. The author's decision not to cook for them is a personal choice, and if it's not causing current issues (as the author mentions they don't notice), maybe it's not the author's fault. However, the husband is now wanting to move past it, which could affect their relationship. The author might be in the right for standing her ground if she genuinely believes the MIL was wrong and there's no reconciliation from the MIL's side. Alternatively, holding a grudge for so long could be seen as unforgiving. \n\nBut the key here is that the MIL hasn't shown any remorse. The author's vow is a response to a direct attack on her cooking, which was a major social event. It's possible that the author is justified in her stance because the MIL's actions were particularly hurtful. The husband's desire to move on might be valid, but it's also possible he's trying to smooth over the relationship without considering his wife's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuance. The author isn't refusing to cook for others, just the MIL, which is reasonable if the MIL was especially cruel. Also, the author's relationship with the MIL is otherwise good except for this. So, the author's actions are a personal choice based on past hurt, and if the MIL hasn't apologized, it's not necessarily wrong to hold that grudge. Therefore, answer B.\n"
