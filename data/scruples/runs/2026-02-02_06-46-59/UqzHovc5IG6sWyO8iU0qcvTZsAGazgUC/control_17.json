We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a woman who hasn't cooked for her in-laws for six years because of an incident involving her mother-in-law's criticism of a cookout.\n\nFirst, the key points: The MIL was unhappy with the meat at a cookout. She asked her husband if it was cooked, he said yes, but she still refused to eat it and later grilled it herself. Then, she criticized the food and had to grill it herself, which upset the husband. The woman vowed not to cook for them again, and now her husband wants her to cook for Easter. She's considering if that's AITA.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's wrong for holding a grudge. Let's break it down. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate. She made a scene at the cookout, criticized the food, and then later blamed the hosts for the food quality. That's pretty rude. However, the woman's response was to stop cooking for them for years. Is that an overreaction?\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was disrespectful and hurtful. The husband was upset, which is valid. The woman's decision to stop cooking is a form of self-respect and protecting her feelings. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL has never apologized or acknowledged her wrong. But the woman mentions that the MIL never apologized. So, from her perspective, there's no resolution. The husband wants to move on, but she hasn't been given an apology. \n\nAlso, the woman says she doesn't think the in-laws even noticed they stopped cooking, implying the grudge hasn't affected them. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since the MIL was at fault, and the woman's reaction is a personal choice to protect herself, maybe she's not in the wrong. But holding a grudge for so long could be seen as not moving past a past issue. However, without an apology, it's hard to see why she should be the one to make the first move. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural expectations or personal values. If the woman is in a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise, maybe not cooking isn't a big deal. But if her husband wants to reconcile, maybe she should consider if it's worth it for him. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the MIL was wrong, she might not be.\n"
