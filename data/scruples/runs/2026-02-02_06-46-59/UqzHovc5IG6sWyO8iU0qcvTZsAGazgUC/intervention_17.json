We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened several years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, and then later complained about the food being bad and that she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them anymore. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, but the author is holding onto the grudge.\n\nSo the main points here are: the MIL's behavior during the cookout, the husband's reaction, and the author's decision to stop cooking for them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, I should consider the MIL's actions. She didn't eat the food, asked if it was cooked enough, and then later criticized the food and the cooking. That could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the author and husband put in effort to host a cookout. The MIL's comment about having to grill it herself implies that the author didn't do it right, which is a direct criticism. That's hurtful and could justify the author's feelings.\n\nHowever, the author has held onto this grudge for six years. That's a long time. Even if the MIL was wrong, holding a grudge for that long might not be healthy. The author's husband is trying to move on, which is a positive step for the relationship. The author's refusal to cook for them could be seen as a way to punish the MIL for past actions, but it's affecting the family dynamics and possibly the marriage.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice the change in behavior. So, the author's action might not be causing any harm to the MIL, but rather creating tension within their own marriage. The husband's desire to move on is important because maintaining healthy relationships within the family is crucial. The author's stance could be seen as selfish if it's causing marital stress over an old issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified if they believe the MIL was in the wrong. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, and holding onto the hurt could be a way to protect themselves from future hurt. But holding a grudge isn't productive in the long run. The author could have addressed the issue at the time or moved on after the husband tried to reconcile. By holding onto it for six years, maybe the author is the one causing unnecessary stress now.\n\nAlso, considering that the author hasn't cooked for them in years, it's possible the MIL isn't even aware, so the author's action isn't affecting the MIL but is causing internal conflict. The husband's perspective is that it's time to let go, which is a mature approach. The author's refusal to comply might be seen as stubbornness rather than justified anger.\n\nIn conclusion, while the MIL's actions were wrong, the author's prolonged grudge is problematic. The author is in the wrong for not moving on and possibly causing marital tension. The right thing would be to forgive and move forward, especially since the MIL might have apologized or the situation is outdated. The author's decision to let go of the past would benefit their relationship with their husband and MIL.\n"
