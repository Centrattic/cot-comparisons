We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) after a cookout incident years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband made a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat because she thought it wasn't cooked enough. She had her FIL check, then took it back to grill herself. The next day, the MIL criticized the food to her husband, making him upset. He tried to talk to her, but she didn't apologize. The author decided never to cook for them again. Now, six years later, the husband wants to move on and have her cook Easter dinner. The author is conflicted, doesn't think the MIL's family has noticed the lack of meals, and has a good relationship otherwise.\n\nThe key points here are about forgiveness, holding a grudge, and the impact on family relations. The author's stance is about not letting the MIL's actions affect her, while the husband wants to move past it. The question is whether holding this grudge for six years makes her the \"asshole.\"\n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness and moving on are often encouraged, especially if it's affecting the family dynamic. However, the MIL's actions were hurtful and public, and the author's response is a personal choice. The husband's position might be that maintaining relationships is important, even if the MIL was wrong. The author's refusal to cook could be seen as a way to assert herself, but holding onto it for so long might be seen as excessive.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of self-respect and not letting someone's criticism define you. If the author feels that cooking for them is a way of being forced to prove herself, then her stance is valid. However, if the MIL hasn't acknowledged her mistake, maybe the author is right to not forgive. But the husband's feelings have been hurt too, so balancing that is important.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, but maybe she's not considering the husband's perspective enough. However, since the MIL hasn't apologized and the author has a good relationship otherwise, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is asking if she's in the wrong. Since the MIL's behavior was inappropriate, the author's reaction could be justified. So maybe the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because holding a grudge for six years could be seen as harsh. However, given the circumstances, she's protecting her self-worth, so B is more likely correct.\n"
