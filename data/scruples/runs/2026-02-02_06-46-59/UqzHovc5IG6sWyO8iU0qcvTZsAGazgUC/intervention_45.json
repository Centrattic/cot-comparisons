We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their spouse built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, took it back to grill more, and later criticized the food. The husband was upset because his mom didn't apologize and instead repeated her criticism. The author decided not to cook for the MIL family again, which has been about six years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding a grudge for so long. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The MIL's actions were unkind, especially after the cookout. She criticized the food and made the husband feel bad. But holding a grudge for six years without cooking for them, even if they might not notice, seems harsh. The author's vow not to cook again could be seen as an overreaction, especially since the MIL might not have intended such a long-lasting fallout. Also, the husband is trying to reconcile, suggesting that moving on would be better for the family relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. The criticism was personal and hurtful. It's their choice to decide how to handle their cooking, and if the MIL's family hasn't noticed the absence, maybe it's not causing harm. However, holding onto this for so long might affect the family dynamics, even if it's not obvious.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's decision to hold the grudge is justified. The initial event was a mistake, but not cooking for six years seems excessive. The author could choose to let go without necessarily cooking for them again, maybe finding a middle ground. The husband's desire to move on is reasonable, and the author's stance might be preventing family harmony. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not letting go, even if the MIL was at fault initially.\n"
