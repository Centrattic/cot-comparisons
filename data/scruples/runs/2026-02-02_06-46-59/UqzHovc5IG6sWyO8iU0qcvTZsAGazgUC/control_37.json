We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to tension with the husband, and the author has since stopped cooking for the in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements of the situation. The MIL's criticism was public and hurtful, leading the husband to feel upset. The author decided not to cook for them again, which the husband now wants to move past. The question is whether holding this grudge is justified.\n\nThe author argues that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's complaint was unwarranted. The MIL's behavior seems harsh, especially since she took the opportunity to criticize after the event. The author's response was to stop cooking, which might be seen as a personal choice rather than a harmful action towards the in-laws. The husband's desire for reconciliation is important, but the author is within their rights to set boundaries based on past hurt.\n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here. Emotionally, the author's decision to protect themselves from potential hurt is understandable. The fact that the author maintains a good relationship otherwise suggests that the issue isn't about the relationship as a whole but a specific incident. The MIL hasn't apologized, which might contribute to the author's stance. \n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as extreme. But considering the MIL's behavior was unapologetic and the author's right to set boundaries, it's a valid personal choice. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because their actions are a response to perceived disrespect and their choice to prioritize their own comfort.\n"
