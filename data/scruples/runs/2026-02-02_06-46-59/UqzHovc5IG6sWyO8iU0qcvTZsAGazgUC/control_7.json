We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a MIL (mother-in-law) who criticized the cookout food and then the author hasn't cooked for them since. The husband wants to move on, but the author is holding a grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The MIL didn't like the meat's doneness and ended up grilling it herself. Then later, she criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author vowed not to cook for them again and kept it for years. Now the husband wants to move past it, but the author is resisting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, holding a grudge for six years seems a bit extreme. The initial incident was a few days after the cookout, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them. The husband is trying to reconcile, but the author is not letting go. \n\nThe key points here are forgiveness and moving on. The author's justification is the MIL's harsh criticism, especially since others didn't complain. The author might feel hurt and wronged, but holding onto it for so long could affect the relationship with the husband. \n\nHowever, the author is standing by their decision because they're not the one who has to cook. The husband is okay with cooking, but he's not good at it. The author might not see the need to cook if the MILs aren't even noticing the absence. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author's feelings are valid. The MIL's actions were hurtful. But holding onto it for years without resolution might be seen as stubborn. The husband is trying to mend things, so the author's refusal could be seen as not cooperating. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for themselves. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's reaction is a boundary. It's a personal choice to protect their feelings. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at proportionality. Six years is a long time. The author might be justified in their initial decision, but not letting go after that time could be seen as the issue. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong for holding onto it so long, but not entirely. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL's behavior was the root cause. The author's response is a personal boundary. So the answer could be B (No).\n"
