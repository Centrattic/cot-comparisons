We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took matters into her own hands by re-grilling the meat. The author hasn't cooked for them since, and now her husband wants to move on, especially for Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The MIL's behavior at the cookout was unkind and unnecessary. She didn't eat the food, criticized it in front of others, and then proceeded to fix it herself. That's pretty harsh. The husband was upset and tried to address it, but she didn't apologize. The author made a vow not to cook for them anymore, which she's kept for years. Now the husband is pushing for reconciliation.\n\nSo, the question is whether holding this grudge for six years is justified. On one hand, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate. The author has a right to feel hurt. On the other hand, holding a grudge for that long might be affecting her relationship with the husband, who wants to move past it. Also, the author mentions that the in-laws might not even notice the absence of her cooking, suggesting that the author's refusal isn't causing them any harm. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, forgiveness can be a personal choice. If the MIL has shown no remorse, maybe the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, the husband is caught in the middle, and maintaining a good relationship with his family is important. The author's stance could be seen as holding onto resentment, which might be unfair if she's not the one who wronged the other party.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms around in-law relationships. In some cultures, family harmony is prioritized, so maybe the author is expected to let go of the grievance. But others might see it as reasonable to protect their own feelings. The key here is that the author hasn't completely cut off the in-laws, just stopped cooking. The husband is willing to cook, but he's not a great cook. The author might be using this as a way to maintain some control or boundary.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe she can cook for them without letting it be a big issue. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the MIL's actions were clearly wrong, the author might not be at fault. However, if holding a grudge for six years is causing unnecessary tension in her marriage, then maybe she is in the wrong for not letting go.\n\nI need to balance the wrongdoing of the MIL against the author's response. The MIL's actions were hurtful, but the author's response is a long-standing refusal to cook, which is a personal choice. If the author feels she's done her part by not cooking and the in-laws haven't noticed, perhaps she's not in the wrong. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but it's his family, and the author's choice to not cook is her own boundary. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
