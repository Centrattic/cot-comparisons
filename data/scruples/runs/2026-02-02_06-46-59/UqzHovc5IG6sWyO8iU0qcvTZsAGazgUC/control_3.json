We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation revolves around a cookout incident years ago where the MIL criticized the food and made the husband uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, asked if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. The next day, the MIL criticized the food at the husband's workplace, causing him to walk away. The husband tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author then decided to stop cooking for the MIL, which has lasted six years. The husband now wants to move on, especially for an upcoming Easter dinner.\n\nThe author is conflicted. They feel justified because no one else had issues with the food. They also mention that the MIL might not even notice the change. The question is whether holding this grudge is wrong.\n\nFrom a relational perspective, holding a grudge for six years over a cooking incident might be seen as excessive. The MIL's actions were hurtful, but the author's response\u2014refusing to cook for them\u2014has long-term consequences. The husband is trying to reconcile, which suggests he values the relationship more. The author's stance could be seen as fair if they feel wronged, but it's important to consider forgiveness and moving forward for the sake of family dynamics.\n\nHowever, the author isn't inconsiderate; they allow the husband to cook if possible. Also, they mention a good relationship otherwise. The key here is whether the punishment (not cooking) fits the offense. The author's feelings are valid, but maybe the duration is too long. The answer might hinge on cultural expectations, personal boundaries, and whether forgiveness is necessary for family harmony.\n\nIn many cases, holding onto such a grudge could strain the family. The author's husband is trying to mend things, which is a positive step. The author's refusal to cook might not directly affect the MIL's feelings, but it could affect their relationship with the husband. The answer is tricky. If the author believes they're justified, but the husband wants to move on, there's a conflict. However, the author isn't necessarily wrong for protecting their feelings. Still, maybe they should consider reconciliation. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author's actions are within their rights (not cooking again), then they aren't in the wrong. But if the grudge is unforgivable or unnecessary, then they might be.\n"
