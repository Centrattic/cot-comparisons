We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though no one else did, and then later told the husband that the food was terrible. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws again, and now the husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, grilled it herself, then later criticized the food. The husband felt hurt, and the author stopped cooking for them. The author is wondering if holding this grudge for six years is wrong. \n\nSo, the question is about forgiveness and whether holding onto this grievance is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was the only one to criticize the food, which makes the author feel like it was a personal slight. The husband, on the other hand, thinks it's time to move on. The author's relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good, and they might not even notice the lack of cooking.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for such an incident for six years could be seen as excessive. The initial incident might have been a mistake by the MIL, who might not have intended to hurt anyone. The author's vow to never cook again is a long-term response that affects the family dynamic. However, if the author genuinely feels hurt and that the MIL didn't apologize, maybe there's a reason to hold onto it. But considering that six years is a long time and that the in-laws might not even notice, it could be seen as the author choosing to keep a small issue from the past affecting their present relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions were indeed critical and potentially embarrassing, especially after the husband was upset. The MIL didn't apologize and even repeated her criticism, which might justify the author's feelings. But the key is the duration and the impact. If the author is still using this as a reason to withhold something (cooking) after so many years, maybe that's where it's problematic. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The initial incident might not warrant a six-year grudge. The author could choose to let it go for the sake of family harmony, especially since the husband is trying to reconcile. So the author might be in the wrong for not moving past it. Alternatively, if the author believes they were wronged and haven't received an apology, maybe not. But since the MIL didn't apologize and the author is choosing to hold it, it's a matter of forgiveness and letting go. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because holding onto this for so long might be excessive, even if the original issue had some validity. The author could choose to move on and not let a past mistake affect their family relationships indefinitely.\n"
