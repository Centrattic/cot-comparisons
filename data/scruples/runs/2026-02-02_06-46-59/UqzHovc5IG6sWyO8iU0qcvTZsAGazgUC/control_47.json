We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident where the MIL criticized the cookout food and then later complained to the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's husband and they built a patio, had a cookout, and the MIL was the only one not eating the meat. She then later complained to the husband about the food quality, which upset him. The author vowed not to cook for the in-laws again, a vow they've kept for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, suggesting cooking Easter dinner next. The author is conflicted because they feel justified in their stance, but the husband is pushing to move past it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The initial incident: the MIL didn't eat her meat, had someone else cook it more, then criticized the food later. This caused the husband emotional distress. The author decided not to cook again for them. Now, after six years, the husband feels it's time to forgive and move on.\n\nThe question is about whether holding this grudge for six years is wrong. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were hurtful and they don't want to cook for someone who criticized their cooking so harshly. But the husband is suggesting letting go of the past.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for such a long time might be seen as unnecessary, especially if the relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good. However, the author's actions (not cooking) haven't caused harm to the in-laws\u2014they just chose not to cook for them. The author might feel justified in their decision, especially if the husband's feelings were hurt. However, the husband's perspective is that it's time to move past it, which could affect their marital relationship if the author is unwilling to comply.\n\nThe key factors here are the duration of the grudge, the impact on the author's and husband's lives, and whether the author's actions (not cooking) are proportionate. The author hasn't cooked for years, but the in-laws might not even notice. It's also mentioned that the relationship is otherwise good, so the issue is isolated to this incident.\n\nIn many cases, holding a grudge for such a long time is considered unhealthy, but it's also about personal boundaries. The author might feel that they are protecting their husband's feelings by not cooking for someone who hurt him. On the other hand, the husband might feel that the situation is resolved and that not cooking is an ongoing punishment.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's refusal to cook is seen as justified or if it's an overreaction. Since the MIL's actions were problematic and the author's decision is a personal choice that hasn't harmed others, some might say the author isn't in the wrong. Others might argue that letting go could be healthier, but that's more of a personal choice than a moral issue.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is standing by a personal decision made after a hurtful incident, and the in-laws haven't noticed the change. It's their choice to set a boundary. However, if the husband's request is part of maintaining their marriage, the author might need to consider that. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about what's best for the relationship. Since the author's actions are a personal boundary and not causing harm, the answer leans towards B.\n"
