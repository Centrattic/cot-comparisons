We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and then later complained to the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later regrilled it. Then, a few days later, the MIL told the husband the food was terrible and that she had to grill it herself, which upset the husband. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore and kept that vow for six years. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering cooking Easter dinner but is reluctant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B.\n\nTo determine this, I should analyze the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. She criticized the food in a private setting and then later confronted the husband, which led to his emotional distress. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which they've done for six years. The husband now wants to move past it, but the author is reluctant, even though they have a good relationship otherwise.\n\nThe key here is the duration of the grudge (six years) and whether the author's actions are justified. The MIL didn't apologize, so the author might feel justified in holding onto the grievance. However, holding a grudge for such a long time could be seen as the author's fault, especially if the MIL's actions were a one-time incident and the author is still choosing not to engage in a positive way (cooking) to mend the relationship. The author also mentions that the in-laws might not even notice, which suggests that the author's resentment is more about their own feelings than the in-laws' well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions were unkind and disrespectful. The author's decision to stop cooking for them could be seen as a boundary to protect themselves from further hurt. However, the time frame is significant. While the MIL's actions were wrong, keeping the grudge for six years might be seen as the author not letting go of a past wrong, which could be considered their fault.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the husband's feelings. The author's decision to not cook is affecting the husband's relationship with his parents. The husband is pushing to move on, so there's a dynamic there where the author's choice is impacting their marriage. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the grudge or if the MIL is the one at fault.\n\nIn terms of societal viewpoints, holding a grudge for such a long time is often frowned upon, especially if there's no ongoing harm. The initial incident was a one-time event, and the author hasn't been cooking for them since, even though the relationship is otherwise good. It might be more about the author's unresolved feelings rather than the MIL's ongoing actions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not letting go of the past and not making an effort to move forward, even if the MIL was initially at fault.\n\nBut the author's decision to set a boundary is also valid. If the author still feels hurt and the MIL hasn't apologized, maintaining that boundary could be justified. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies whether the author's actions are unreasonable. If the author is still holding onto a six-year-old grudge without any resolution from the other side, it's possible that they are in the wrong for not letting go. Alternatively, if the author is protecting their own emotional well-being, it's a gray area.\n\nConsidering the user's perspective, they think the author is in the wrong. The analysis leans towards the author possibly being in the wrong because holding a grudge for such a long time, even if justified initially, might not be healthy or fair in the long term. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
