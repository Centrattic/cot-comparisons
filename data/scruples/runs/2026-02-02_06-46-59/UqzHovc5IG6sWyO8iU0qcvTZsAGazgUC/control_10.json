We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the key incident happened a few years ago when the author and her husband hosted a cookout for their in-laws and others. The MIL (mother-in-law) didn't eat the meat initially, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, he said yes, but she still took it back to the grill. Then a few days later, the MIL criticized the food at the cookout and told her son (the husband) that the food was terrible, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore, and it's been six years. Now the husband is pushing to move on, especially for an upcoming Easter dinner, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for still holding a grudge and not forgiving her MIL after so long. Let's look at the facts and the perspectives involved.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the MIL not only criticized the food in front of others but then later took the opportunity to confront her son at work, making him feel hurt. The author took this as a personal slight, especially since others didn't have issues with the food. She made a vow not to cook for them again as a result, and she's been holding onto that. She feels the MIL's actions were more than just a simple comment about the food; it was a public criticism that affected her husband emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is advocating for moving on. He might feel that holding onto this for six years is unfair, especially if the MIL never apologized and the author is otherwise on good terms with them. The author also mentions that the in-laws might not even have noticed the lack of her cooking, so maybe the issue is more internal for her and the husband than the MIL's side.\n\nNow, considering typical AITA scenarios, people often consider the balance between the severity of the offense and the length of the grudge. The MIL's behavior was unkind and public, which could be seen as a breach of etiquette. The author's punishment (not cooking for them) is a personal choice that affects her relationship with her husband and possibly the in-laws, but if the in-laws are unaware, maybe the conflict is between the author and her husband.\n\nThe husband's reaction is important too. He was hurt by his mother's words, and the author's decision to stop cooking might be a form of standing by him. However, after six years, the author might be holding onto a grudge longer than necessary, especially if there's no indication that the MIL has apologized or changed her behavior. The question is whether the author is still right to hold onto this, or if it's time to forgive and move on for the sake of family harmony.\n\nIn many AITA situations, the community often looks for whether the person's actions have a valid reason and if the punishment fits. Here, the author's initial reaction could be seen as justified (not cooking again because of the public criticism and hurt to her husband), but holding onto it for six years without any resolution might be seen as excessive. The husband's push to move on suggests that maybe the author is the one causing ongoing tension by not letting go, even if the original issue hasn't been resolved.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the MIL's behavior was a one-time but significant breach, and she hasn't apologized, so there's no reason to forgive. The fact that the MIL's criticism was harsh and led to public embarrassment (through the husband) could be seen as valid grounds for resentment. But the length of time is a factor here. Six years is a long time, and holding onto this might be affecting the author's and her husband's relationship, as well as family interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had a valid reason initially, holding onto the grudge for six years without any reconciliation efforts might make her in the wrong. The answer could be A (yes, she is in the wrong) because she's prolonging a conflict that might not need to continue, especially if the in-laws haven't noticed and she's otherwise on good terms with them. Alternatively, if the community sees the MIL's actions as more severe, the author might not be in the wrong (B). But given the time frame, it's more likely that holding a grudge this long is the issue here, so the answer might be A.\n"
