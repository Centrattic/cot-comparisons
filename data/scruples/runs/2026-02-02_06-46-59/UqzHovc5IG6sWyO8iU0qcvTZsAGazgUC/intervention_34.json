We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and later confronted the husband, causing him distress. The author hasn't cooked for the MIL since then and is being asked by their husband to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key elements here. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, asked if it was cooked, then later grilled it herself. Then she criticized the food when visiting the husband at work, leading to him walking away. The author took offense and hasn't cooked for them, keeping their monthly dinners from that point on. Now, the husband wants to move past it and the author is hesitant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider the perspectives. The MIL's behavior seems harsh and inconsiderate. She criticized the food publicly in front of the husband, which hurt him. The author's vow not to cook for them again could be seen as a justified response to protect their feelings and maintain self-respect. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. \n\nBut the author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely; their relationship is otherwise good. The author is standing by their decision because the MIL's actions were hurtful, and they didn't apologize. The husband feels it's time to move on, but the author is firm. \n\nIs the author wrong for not forgiving? Well, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author's decision not to cook is a boundary they set after being hurt. While the MIL's actions were inconsiderate, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as not letting go, affecting family dynamics. However, the author isn't causing direct harm now; they're just not cooking. The husband is being asked to move on, but the author is standing their ground. \n\nConsidering that the MIL didn't apologize and the author's feelings are valid, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author's stance is causing marital tension, maybe there's a need for reconciliation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. \n\nThe key points are: the MIL's behavior was hurtful, the author's response was to set a boundary, and they've maintained it for six years. If the author's refusal to cook isn't affecting the MIL's well-being and their relationship is otherwise okay, perhaps the author is justified. However, holding a grudge for that long could be seen as stubborn. But the author isn't hurting anyone now, just not cooking. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author has the right to set boundaries after being hurt, and the MIL didn't apologize. The author's decision to protect their feelings is valid, even if it's been six years.\n"
