We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and her mother-in-law (MIL) over a past cookout incident. \n\nFirst, the author's MIL didn't eat the food initially, asked her FIL if the meat was cooked enough, and then took it back to grill. The author and her husband had to cook it again. Then a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and said she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset and told the MIL, but she didn't apologize. The author vowed not to cook for them again and hasn't for six years. Now, the husband wants to move on and cook Easter dinner, but the author is reluctant.\n\nI need to determine if holding a grudge for six years is reasonable. The key points here are the initial incident's severity and the author's response. The MIL's initial criticism was public and then later private, which hurt the husband. The author's vow not to cook for them seems like a long time. Also, the author mentions that no one else had issues with the food except the MIL, which might have made the author feel personally targeted.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should consider whether the author's reaction is proportional. Holding a grudge for six years without communication or attempts to reconcile might be seen as unreasonable. The author's husband is trying to move on, which suggests he sees this as a past issue. The author's position is that the MIL was the only one who had a problem, so maybe she feels justified. But the impact on her relationship with her husband and MIL could be a factor. If the author hasn't cooked for them in six years and the MIL hasn't apologized, but the author could still choose to act despite the past. \n\nAlso, the author says they have a good relationship otherwise. Maybe the author is using this as a way to hold power or express her hurt, which might not be healthy. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. If the MIL didn't apologize and the author feels wronged, maybe she's not in the wrong for holding onto it. However, the length of time and the impact on the husband might tip the scales. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's response is proportionate and if there's a reason to hold it for six years. If the author feels it's justified due to the MIL's continued stance, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the situation was resolved by the husband and the author's refusal is causing issues, then maybe she is. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh my own judgment here. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because holding a grudge for six years without any attempt to reconcile or considering the husband's perspective might be excessive. The initial incident, while hurtful, doesn't justify such a long-standing vow, especially if it's affecting the current relationship dynamics. The author should consider forgiveness and moving on, even if the MIL hasn't apologized.\n"
