We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout. The situation involves MIL criticizing the food and the author deciding not to cook for them again. The husband now wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The MIL's actions were unkind and hurtful, especially since she took the food issue personally and made her son feel bad. The author's reaction is to stop cooking for them, which seems like a reasonable boundary given the MIL's behavior. The author mentions that others didn't have a problem with the food, so the criticism was unwarranted.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The question is whether the author's refusal to cook for them is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was the only one with a complaint and that their relationship is otherwise good. The husband is trying to move forward, which is a valid point. But the author hasn't done anything wrong by setting a boundary based on past hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that holding onto this for so long is unfair, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized. But the author isn't harming anyone by not cooking; it's their choice. The key here is that the author isn't being asked to forgive or forget, just to reconsider their stance. The husband's perspective is important too, as he might feel the need to reconcile the relationship. \n\nIn the end, the author's decision is a personal choice. While it's understandable given the MIL's behavior, others might see it as holding onto resentment unnecessarily. But the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their experience. So I think the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
