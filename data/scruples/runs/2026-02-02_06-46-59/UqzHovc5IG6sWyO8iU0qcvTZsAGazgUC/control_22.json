We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, the incident: The family had a cookout where the MIL was unhappy with the meat's doneness. She took it back to the grill, and later criticized the food to the point where she told her son (the husband) the food was terrible and she had to re-cook it. The husband was upset, the wife decided not to cook for them again, and it's been six years since then.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's actions seem to be disrespectful. She criticized the food in front of others and later confronted the husband. The author's decision to stop cooking for them could be seen as a justified response to being disrespected. Also, the author mentions that the MIL didn't apologize, so the hurt might still be there. The author's stance is that they're not cooking again because of the specific criticism, not just any minor issue, and others didn't have a problem with the food.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as holding onto a past issue that doesn't affect current relationships. The husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook for them again. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by not letting go of this. Also, the author mentions that the MIL might not even have noticed they stopped cooking, so maybe the issue is internal rather than causing ongoing harm.\n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness and moving on can be seen as mature, especially if the relationship overall is good. However, if the original action was particularly hurtful and there was no apology, it's understandable to have lingering feelings. The author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely, just not cooking for them, which might be a personal boundary.\n\nI think the key points are: the MIL's actions were disrespectful, the author's response was to not cook again (a personal choice), the husband wants reconciliation, and the author is questioning if they're being too harsh. The answer might hinge on whether the author's stance is reasonable given the MIL's lack of apology and the specific nature of the criticism.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The MIL's behavior was the root cause, and the author's response is a personal boundary. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
