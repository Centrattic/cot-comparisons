We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and later told the husband that the food was terrible, leading to the author vowing not to cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements of the story. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh\u2014she criticized the food publicly, took the meat back to the grill, and then later told the husband that the food was awful. This caused the husband to feel hurt and walk away. The author hasn't cooked for the in-laws since, even after six years, and the husband wants to move on. \n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should think about forgiveness, the duration of the hold on the grudge, and the impact on the family.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was unkind and disrespectful. She criticized the meal and took things too far by grilling it herself in front of others. This could be seen as a breach of social etiquette. The author's reaction of cutting off cooking duties might be a way to protect their husband's feelings and set boundaries. If the MIL hasn't apologized, it's understandable that the author is still upset.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author mentions that their relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good, and maybe the MIL didn't mean to cause lasting harm. The husband is asking to move on, which suggests he wants to mend fences. The author's refusal to cook might be affecting family dynamics, especially if the husband is involved. Also, the author says others at the cookout didn't have issues, so maybe the MIL's reaction was out of line compared to others.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The problem is that the author is the one holding the grudge, not the MIL. If the MIL didn't apologize, the author isn't obligated to forgive. However, if the author's actions (not cooking) are causing tension within the marriage, that's a different angle. The husband is pushing for reconciliation, so the author's stance might be affecting their relationship.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the focus is on the person asking if they're the bad one. The author feels justified in their actions, but others might argue that holding onto this for years is unnecessary. However, since the MIL was at fault initially, the author's response might be seen as reasonable. The key here is whether the author's actions are warranted given the MIL's behavior. Since the author hasn't cooked for them in years, maybe it's a way to protect themselves and their husband from future criticism. But the husband is now asking to move past it, which could mean the author is holding onto past hurt, which might not be healthy for the family.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong for holding onto this, especially since the MIL didn't apologize. However, the duration and the fact that the husband is now asking to move on could mean the author needs to reconsider. But legally or morally, the author isn't \"in the wrong\" because the MIL's actions were the initial problem. The answer might be B (No), as the author isn't at fault for not forgiving yet, but maybe should consider moving on for the family's sake.\n"
