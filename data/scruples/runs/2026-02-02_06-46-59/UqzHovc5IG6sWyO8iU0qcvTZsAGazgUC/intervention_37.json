We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened several years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading the author to vow never to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the incident. The MIL's actions during the cookout were unkind. She didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later complained about the food quality and even grilling it herself. The husband was hurt, and the author decided to stop cooking for them as a result. The key points here are the MIL's behavior and the author's response.\n\nThe author's decision to hold a grudge for six years seems extreme to some. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, which might be because holding onto this grudge for so long could be seen as unforgiving. But maybe the author felt justified because the MIL's criticism was public and hurtful, and the husband was affected. \n\nHowever, the author's husband is now urging reconciliation, and the author is resisting. The author's rationale is that no one else had an issue with the food, only the MIL. But holding a vow for six years might not be healthy for family relationships. Also, the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice they've stopped cooking, implying that the author's action isn't causing harm but is instead a personal choice.\n\nBut forgiveness and moving on are often considered important for maintaining peace and family harmony. The author's stance could be seen as a personal right to set boundaries, especially if the MIL's behavior was disrespectful. On the other hand, holding a grudge without resolution might not be fair if the MIL hasn't apologized and the situation is now in the past.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the husband's feelings. The author is supporting his choice to walk away from the confrontation, but now he wants to move past it. The author's refusal to cook might be affecting their marriage dynamics. The author might feel justified in protecting their own feelings, but it's possible that the husband's perspective is that it's time to heal.\n\nIn terms of cultural or social norms, in some contexts, holding a grudge for this long could be seen as overly harsh. However, if the original offense was a significant emotional hurt, the response might be considered reasonable. The question is whether the author's continued refusal is the right approach, especially when the husband is trying to mend the relationship.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate to the incident. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's response of a six-year grudge might be excessive. The author could be in the right if they feel it's necessary to set boundaries, but in terms of forgiveness and moving forward, it's a gray area. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the user thinks they are, I need to consider if the author is indeed in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's decision to not cook for the MIL is a personal choice, but holding onto the grudge without any reconciliation might be seen as not in the wrong, given the MIL's actions. However, the husband's desire to move on and the potential for family harmony might mean the author should consider forgiveness. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is justified in their stance based on the MIL's behavior, but the user's initial thought is A. I need to weigh the cultural expectation of forgiveness versus the right to set personal boundaries.\n"
