We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, asked if it was cooked enough, then took it back to grill. Later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about cooking Easter dinner.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for six years. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me break down the key points:\n\n1. The incident involved the MIL's criticism of the food, which led to the husband feeling hurt. The author stopped cooking for them as a result.\n2. The author's husband is now pushing to move on, suggesting they cook an Easter dinner.\n3. The author believes that no one else had issues with the food except the MIL. The author also mentions that they don't think the MIL has noticed the absence of their cooking, implying that the author's action isn't causing current harm.\n4. The author has a generally good relationship with the MIL otherwise.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. From a conflict resolution perspective, holding a grudge for six years is a long time. The author's action of not cooking is a passive response that doesn't address the root issue. However, the MIL's behavior was problematic\u2014publicly criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a way to protect their own feelings and set boundaries, especially since the husband was the one who was directly criticized.\n\nBut the husband is now asking to move on, which might be about mending the relationship. The author is in a tricky spot because they feel the MIL's actions were unfair, but the husband wants to let go of the past. The author might feel justified in their stance because the MIL's actions were hurtful. However, holding onto the grudge for so long could be seen as preventing personal growth and potentially affecting the family dynamic, especially if the author's husband is trying to reconcile.\n\nBut the author isn't causing harm to the MIL by not cooking anymore, and the MIL hasn't apologized. The author's action is their own choice, and if it's not affecting others negatively (as they mention the MIL hasn't noticed), then maybe they aren't in the wrong. The key here is about forgiveness and moving on. However, the author might be holding onto resentment unnecessarily, especially if the MIL isn't aware of the issue or hasn't addressed it. It's also possible that the author is using this as a way to avoid potential future conflicts, which could be a valid strategy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. From one angle, the author is justified in protecting their own feelings and setting boundaries. From another angle, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as clinging to an old issue that might not be worth continuing. The answer might depend on cultural norms around forgiveness and family dynamics. In many cases, moving on from past conflicts is encouraged for the sake of family harmony, but if the author feels the MIL's actions were particularly egregious and unforgivable, then the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are justified in their feelings given the MIL's behavior. However, there's a case for A if the situation is about the duration of the grudge. But the key factors are the MIL's initial fault and the author's husband being the one who was hurt. The author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice in response to a hurtful situation. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking again, so it's not a clear case of being in the wrong.\n"
