I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for publicizing the emails between their sister and the head swimming coach.\n\nSo, the sister was told she was accepted by the coach, but then found out she wasn't. The coach admitted it was a mistake, emailing a list that included both applicants and accepted students. The author took screenshots and posted them online to raise awareness. Now, some people, including current team members, are saying the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to highlight a mistake that caused emotional harm to their sister. They wanted to prevent others from going through the same issue. But is publicizing private emails justified?\n\nOn one hand, the coach made an error that caused distress. The family felt the university should be held accountable. Sharing the emails could serve as a warning to others. On the other hand, the emails might be considered private communications. By posting them publicly, the author might be violating privacy or contributing to public shaming, which isn't productive. Also, the coach did apologize, and the author's action could be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily.\n\nAnother angle: the coach's mistake was an honest error. The author's action might damage the coach's reputation without clear malice. However, the coach's actions led to real harm, so there's a case for transparency. But is social media the right venue? Maybe there are other ways to address this, like contacting the university administration.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the swimmers are biased. They might defend their coach, but does that affect the author's right to share the emails? The author's intent is noble, but the method could be questionable. Public shaming can lead to other issues, like harassment or privacy concerns.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, if there's no explicit policy against sharing such emails, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if there's an expectation of privacy in those communications, the author could be overstepping. It's a bit of a gray area. But considering the emotional harm caused and the desire to prevent similar issues, the author's action is understandable, but maybe not the best approach. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because their intent was to raise awareness about a systemic issue, even if the method is debatable. However, if the coach's mistake was a genuine error without malice, the author's public shaming might be excessive. But given the context of the college admissions stress and the coach's role in misleading the family, the author's action could be justified as a form of accountability. So, the answer is probably B (No), but there are complexities.\n"
