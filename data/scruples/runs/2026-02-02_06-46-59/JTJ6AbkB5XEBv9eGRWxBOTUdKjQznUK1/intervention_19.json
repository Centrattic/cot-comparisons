I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicly sharing emails between their sister and a university coach. The context is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which turned out not to be the case, causing her emotional distress. The author put the email thread on social media to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coach's mistake was a miscommunication, albeit a serious one. The sister was misled, leading to emotional harm. The author's action was to expose this publicly, using screenshots of the emails. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intent was to raise awareness about the problem, possibly to prevent others from going through the same experience. They might argue that the university's process is flawed and that transparency is necessary. However, sharing private communications without consent can be a breach of privacy for both the sister and the coach. The coach might have legitimate reasons for wanting to avoid public scrutiny, especially if it's a genuine mistake. \n\nThe author's sister was harmed, but publicly shaming the coach or the university might not be the best way to address it. Instead, perhaps a direct approach with the university's administration would be more appropriate. The author could have sought a resolution through proper channels rather than airing the issue on social media. \n\nAlso, the response from some students at the university suggests that publicizing the emails might not be fair to the coach and could harm others connected to the university, like the swimmers. The author's action might be seen as damaging the reputation of the coach and the university without allowing them to respond adequately in a private setting. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, sharing private emails without consent is generally considered wrong. Even with good intentions, it can lead to privacy violations and potential defamation if the context isn't fully understood by the public. The author might be justified in their frustration, but the method of addressing the issue could have been more constructive. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for sharing the emails publicly without considering the privacy and reputational aspects involved.\n"
