I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's sister got a fake acceptance email from a college coach, which led to her being elated and then devastated when it turned out to be a mistake. The author then publicly shared the email thread on social media to highlight the issue. Now, others are arguing that the author did the wrong thing by publicizing the emails.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. He said he sent out emails to both applicants and those accepted, but mixed up the messages. That's a clear error on his part. The sister was left in a really tough spot emotionally. The author's intent in sharing the emails publicly was to raise awareness about this kind of mistake affecting student-athletes, especially since college admissions are a big topic. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. Is it wrong to post the emails publicly? On one hand, the author is trying to protect their sister and prevent this from happening to others. They might feel that the university and coach need to be held accountable. On the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could be a privacy violation. The coach might have a right to his privacy, even if he made a mistake. Also, other students on the swim team are upset because they feel the author is being biased against the coach, which could affect their reputation or opportunities. \n\nThe coach did apologize and admitted fault. The author's public exposure could cause further reputational damage to the coach and the university. However, the sister's experience is valid, and the author is trying to bring attention to a systemic issue. But the method of using social media to share the emails might be seen as public shaming, which is often considered harsh. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The sister's emails were shared without the coach's permission, and maybe even without the sister's full consent? The author might have thought it was necessary, but others might argue that it's not their place to do that. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's actions could be seen as justified if the intent is to prevent future harm, but the method might be questionable. Alternatively, the author could have addressed the issue privately through the university's channels instead of going public. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the author is in the wrong because they shared private information publicly without considering the potential consequences for the coach and the university, even if their intentions were good. However, the coach's mistake was significant, so maybe there's some nuance here. But generally, publicizing someone's private emails can be problematic regardless of the reason.\n"
