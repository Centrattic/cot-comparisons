I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's sister received an email from a swim coach saying she was accepted to the university, which led to her being excited and then devastated when she found out it was a mistake. The author then publicly shared the email thread on social media to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. The coach admitted to sending the email to someone who wasn't accepted, mixing up applicants and accepted students. That's a serious error, especially in the college admissions process. The sister was led to believe she was accepted, which caused emotional distress. The coach's apology seems to acknowledge the mistake but also mentions that planning ahead with recruits is customary. However, that doesn't excuse the error in this case.\n\nNow, the author's action was to publicize the emails. The key question is whether this action was appropriate. On one hand, the author might feel that the university needs to be held accountable for such a mistake, especially since it affected their sister so much. They might believe that others could be affected similarly and want to prevent that. Publicizing the emails could serve as a warning and push for transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails publicly could be seen as violating privacy. The coach and the university might have personal information or communications that are not meant for public view. Additionally, the public shaming might not be the best approach to resolve the issue. The swimmers from the university who criticized the author might have a point if the emails contained sensitive information. However, they might not fully understand the sister's emotional trauma.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author's intention was to seek accountability and prevent similar issues. But the method of sharing this publicly could be seen as crossing a line, even with good intentions. There might be alternative ways to address the issue, like contacting the university's administration or media outlets for a more measured response.\n\nAlso, the impact on the coach's reputation and the university's reputation needs to be considered. The author's action could harm the coach's career or the university's standing, which could be seen as a disproportionate response if the mistake was unintentional and addressed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author is advocating for their sister, which is understandable, but publicizing private emails might infringe on the coach's privacy. However, if the emails are evidence of a mistake that caused harm, some might argue it's justified.\n\nLooking at similar situations, sometimes whistleblowers are criticized for going public, but if there's a systemic issue, publicizing it can lead to change. Here, the issue is a one-off mistake by the coach. The university might have processes in place that failed, and the coach admitted fault. But the author's action could prevent future mistakes by highlighting the problem.\n\nSo, considering all sides, the author's action might be seen as justified if the goal is to prevent others from going through the same experience. However, the method of publicizing the emails might be questionable due to privacy concerns. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the coach made a mistake that caused harm, and the author is trying to hold them accountable, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a valid argument the other way.\n\nI think the key factors are the intent and the proportionality. Since the author's sister was significantly affected, and the mistake was serious, the author's action might be seen as a justified response. However, the public nature of sharing the emails could be problematic. But if the emails are shared to inform others and not for malice, maybe it's acceptable. The answer might be B (No, not in the wrong), but there's a lot of nuance here.\n"
