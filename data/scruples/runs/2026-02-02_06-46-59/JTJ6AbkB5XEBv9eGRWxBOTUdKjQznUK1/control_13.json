I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the email thread on social media is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister was told she was accepted by the coach, but it was a mistake. The family was excited, then devastated when the acceptance didn't come through. The author publicized the emails to show the university's mistake.\n\nThe coach admitted he sent the email by mistake to someone who hadn't been accepted yet. The family is upset, and the author shares the emails publicly. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nSo, the author's action is leaking private emails. The coach's email was a mistake, but the family's reaction is understandable. However, publishing private communications can be problematic. The key points here are the intent and the consequences.\n\nThe author did it to highlight the university's error and prevent others from going through the same. But sharing private emails without consent can invade privacy, even if it's to expose a mistake. The coach might have made an error, but the public exposure could have repercussions on his reputation beyond the situation. Also, the swimmers who are now defending the coach might feel that the author is targeting the coach unfairly.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's frustration is real. The sister went through emotional turmoil. The author's motivation is to bring attention to a systemic issue in college admissions, which is a valid concern. But the method of sharing private emails without permission is ethically questionable.\n\nConsider if there were other ways to address this, like contacting the university directly or using official channels. By going public, the author bypassed those steps, which could be seen as escalating the issue unnecessarily. However, if the university didn't take the matter seriously, the author might have felt forced to take this action.\n\nThe answer hinges on balancing the right to privacy against the public interest in exposing a mistake. Since the emails were shared without consent, even with good intentions, the author is likely in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
