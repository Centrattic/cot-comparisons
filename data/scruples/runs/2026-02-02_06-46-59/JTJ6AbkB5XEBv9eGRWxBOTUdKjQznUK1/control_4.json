I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for publicizing the emails between their sister and the coach. The situation involves a mix-up where the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted into the university and the swim team, but then she wasn't actually accepted, causing emotional distress.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coach made an honest mistake, emailing someone who had recently applied but wasn't accepted, using the same message as those who were accepted. The family was misled, leading to the sister's emotional trauma. The author took screenshots of the email thread and shared them publicly on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same problem.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The coach's error was significant and caused harm. The family's frustration is understandable, especially with the added stress of college admissions and athletic aspirations. The author's action was to expose the mistake publicly, which could be seen as a way to hold the university accountable and prevent similar incidents. However, sharing private emails without consent might be a privacy issue. Even if the intention is good, releasing someone's private correspondence without their permission could be problematic, especially if the emails were not public before.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the university's process is flawed and that the story needs to be told. There's a public interest angle here, especially in the context of college admissions, which is a widely discussed topic. The author might believe that the public has a right to know about such mistakes in the system.\n\nBut then again, the coach might have legitimate privacy concerns. The emails were between the coach and the student, and sharing them publicly without the coach's consent could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. Even if the coach made a mistake, the author's action could damage the coach's reputation and career, which might be disproportionate to the error.\n\nAlso, the fact that other students on the team are upset about the public sharing suggests there's a community impact. They might feel that their teammates' privacy is being invaded or that the coach is being unfairly targeted. However, the author's primary concern is their sister's experience and ensuring the university is held accountable.\n\nLegal aspects could also come into play. Depending on the jurisdiction, sharing private emails without consent could be a violation of privacy laws or defamation if it harms someone's reputation. But since the post is on social media, it's a public platform, and sometimes people use it to expose wrongdoing, which complicates the issue.\n\nMoral responsibility: The author intended to protect their sister and warn others. But did they have the right to do so by releasing private information? The coach admitted fault, and perhaps the family could have addressed it through the university's channels instead of public exposure.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the key issue is whether the author's action of publicizing the emails was justified. Since they did so to highlight a genuine mistake that caused harm and to prevent future occurrences, some might argue it's not in the wrong. But others might say that the method was inappropriate, and the author should have gone through proper channels first.\n\nIn conclusion, there are valid arguments on both sides. The author's intention was noble, but the method involved violating privacy. Depending on the context and the laws in their area, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they shared private information without consent. However, if the public interest in exposing systemic issues outweighs individual privacy concerns, the answer might be No (B). But given the scenario as presented, the ethical stance might be that the author is in the wrong for breaching privacy despite good intentions.\n"
