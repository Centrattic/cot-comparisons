I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for publicizing emails between their sister and the swim coach. The sister was told she was accepted and then found out it wasn't actually the case. The coach admitted to an error, and the author put the emails on social media to raise awareness.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the circumstances. The coach made a mistake, and this caused the sister a lot of emotional distress. The author's intention was to make the university accountable and warn others. But then, there's the argument about privacy and the impact on the coach and the university.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're justified because the coach made a mistake that hurt their sister. Publicizing the emails could be seen as exposing a legitimate issue in the admissions process, especially if others might benefit from knowing. But on the other hand, sharing private communications without consent could infringe on the coach's right to privacy, even if the coach was at fault. Also, the coach did apologize, so maybe the author's actions escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nI wonder if there's a better way to address this. Maybe the family could have taken the matter to the university's administration to seek a resolution instead of public shaming. Publicizing the emails might have caused additional harm to the coach's reputation beyond the mistake. However, the emotional harm to the sister is real, and the author might feel that the only way to get justice is by making it public.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical aspects here. Is publicizing private emails acceptable when it's to highlight a mistake that caused someone distress? Or does that cross a line into violating privacy? There's a balance between accountability and privacy. The coach's mistake was significant, but the author's method of addressing it might be seen as disproportionate. The fact that other students from the university are upset at the author suggests there's a community impact too.\n\nI think the key points are the coach's apology, the public nature of the emails, and the intent behind the author's action. The author's intent was to protect their sister and prevent others from going through the same. However, the means of doing so by sharing private communications could be problematic. It might be considered in the wrong because they exposed private information, even if their intentions were good. So maybe Answer A (yes, the author is in the wrong) is the right choice here.\n"
