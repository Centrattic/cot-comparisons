I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is that the author's younger sister got an email from a swim coach saying she was accepted to the university and the team, but it was a mistake. The author then publicly shared the email thread on social media to highlight the issue, and now some people are saying the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements here. The coach sent an incorrect email, leading the sister to believe she was accepted when she wasn't. The family was upset, and the author took screenshots and posted them publicly. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to expose the coach's mistake and prevent similar issues for others. They might argue that the university needs accountability and that they were protecting their sister's interests. On the other hand, sharing private emails without permission could be a breach of privacy, even if the motive is good. The coach might have had a genuine mistake, and the author's public shaming could damage the coach's reputation unfairly.\n\nAlso, the two current students on the team say the author is wrong, possibly because they know the coach's side or fear repercussions. The author might be seen as violating confidentiality, even if the coach was at fault. However, if the coach made a public error that caused harm, the author could argue that transparency is necessary.\n\nI need to consider ethical aspects here. Privacy vs. accountability. The author's right to share information they believe is important against the coach's right to privacy and reputation. There's also the family's right to seek justice for their sister's emotional distress. But publicizing private communications can have consequences, and maybe there were other ways to address the issue, like through the university's formal channels.\n\nIn some cases, sharing such emails could be protected as free speech if it's in the public interest, but it's a gray area. The author's actions might have been a form of advocacy for their sister, but it's possible they overstepped by not giving the coach a chance to resolve it privately first.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private correspondence publicly, which can be invasive and potentially unjust, even if the motive was good. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the action was a justified attempt to hold the university accountable. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A because the privacy aspect is a significant factor.\n"
