I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for publicizing the emails between their sister and the head swimming coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the coach that she was accepted into the university and part of the swimming team. This led the family to get excited, and then it turned out to be a mistake. The coach admitted that he sent the email to people who had applied early action, not those who were accepted. The family is upset, and the author posted the emails publicly on social media. Now, some people, including current students on the swim team, are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the coach's mistake significant and harmful? The sister was emotionally affected, which is valid. But the author's response was to publicize the emails. \n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, publishing private emails without consent can be problematic. Even if the intent is to expose a mistake or hold someone accountable, releasing personal information can have consequences. The coach might have violated privacy or made an error, but the family's response of sharing it publicly might not be the right approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the family felt wronged and wanted to raise awareness about the college admissions process. But does that justify making the emails public? There's a line between seeking accountability and violating privacy. \n\nAlso, the coach apologized and admitted the mistake. The author's action might be seen as adding insult to injury, potentially harming the coach's reputation beyond what the mistake warranted. \n\nI should consider if there were other ways to address the issue, like contacting the university's administration directly or seeking some form of formal complaint. Public shaming via social media could lead to further complications and might not be the most appropriate method. \n\nHowever, the sister's emotional distress is real, and the author's intention was to prevent others from experiencing the same. But does the public sharing cross into defamation or breach of privacy? \n\nIt's possible that the author is in the wrong here because using public forums without the consent of the involved parties might infringe on privacy. Even if the situation is frustrating, releasing emails without permission could be seen as unethical or even inappropriate, regardless of the intent. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because publishing private emails, even in response to a mistake, is not the correct approach. The proper channels should be used to address the issue without making personal information public.\n"
