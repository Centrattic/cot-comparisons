I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong for publicizing the email thread between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was led to believe she was accepted into a university through a coaching program, but it turned out to be a mistake by the coach. The author shared the emails publicly to highlight the university's mistake and make sure others know what happened. However, the swimmers and others at the university are upset about the public exposure.\n\nSo, the question is whether sharing the emails was wrong. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, so maybe he's at fault. The author's intention was to warn others and hold the university accountable. But they did share personal emails without the coach's consent. \n\nLegally, sharing someone's private emails could be an issue unless there's public interest. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author's sister was harmed by the mistake, and they might feel justified in exposing the coach. However, publicizing the emails could damage the coach's reputation beyond the actual mistake. \n\nThe coach's excuse was an honest error, but maybe he should have been more careful. The author's action might be seen as a form of shaming or retaliation. But considering the sister's distress and the coach's negligence in handling communications, the author might argue it's justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the swimmers might lose their positions if the coach is criticized. The public shaming could have unintended consequences. The author didn't seek any kind of mediated resolution before going public. Maybe they should have worked with the university first.\n\nBut the university didn't take responsibility beyond the coach's apology. The author might feel they had no other recourse. However, sharing personal correspondence publicly isn't the standard approach. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer depends on balancing the sister's harm and the coach's mistake versus the potential harm from publicizing the emails. The author's actions could be seen as wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were good. So, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there are arguments both ways.\n"
