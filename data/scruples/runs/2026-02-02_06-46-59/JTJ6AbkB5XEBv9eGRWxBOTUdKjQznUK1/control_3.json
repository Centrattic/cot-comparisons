I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email thread between their sister and the coach.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister got a premature acceptance email from the coach, which turned out to be a mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email. The family was upset, and the author posted the emails publicly to highlight the issue.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Was the coach's mistake significant? Yes, but he apologized. The author's action was to publicize the emails to make a point about the admissions process and to prevent others from similar experiences. However, sharing private emails without consent can have consequences. The author might be protecting their sister's interests, but did they overstep by making it public?\n\nOn one hand, the coach's error caused emotional distress, and the family is seeking accountability. On the other hand, the emails were private, and publishing them could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intention was good. Also, the university might have policies against such public disclosures. The two swimmers mentioned might be defending the coach because of their personal connections, but the author's intent was to raise awareness.\n\nBut does that justify publicizing private emails? It's a tricky balance between free speech and privacy. In some cases, exposing institutional errors for the public good is seen as justified, but in others, it could be seen as defaming or violating confidentiality. The coach's mistake was acknowledged, and perhaps a private resolution would be more appropriate. However, the author felt the situation was significant enough to warrant public attention.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author's intention was to highlight a systemic issue, but the method involved sharing private communications. Depending on cultural context and specific circumstances, this might be seen as crossing a line. However, given the emotional impact on their sister, some might argue the author was within rights to act as they did.\n\nSo, considering both sides, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the intent was to expose a mistake that affected their sister and prevent others from similar harm. However, the privacy aspect is a valid concern. But in the context of the story, the answer might be B.\n"
