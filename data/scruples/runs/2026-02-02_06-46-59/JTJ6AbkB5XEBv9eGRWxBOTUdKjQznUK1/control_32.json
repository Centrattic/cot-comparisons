I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong for sharing the email exchange publicly. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister was led to believe she was accepted into a university through a coach's email, but it turned out to be a mistake. The coach apologized, saying he accidentally emailed the wrong person. The family is upset, and the author shared the emails on social media to highlight the university's mistake.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. On one hand, the author's intention was to expose a mistake that affected their sister, possibly to prevent others from going through the same issue. They might feel justified in seeking accountability and support for their sister's emotional distress.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent can be a breach of privacy, even if the intent is good. The coach's mistake was addressed with an apology, and the author's public shaming could have consequences like damaging the coach's reputation or the university's standing. Also, the other students mentioned are on the swim team, which might mean personal connections or potential backlash against them.\n\nThe key points to consider are: consent from the parties involved, the public nature of the sharing, the intention behind it, and the potential harm caused. The coach did admit fault, so the issue was acknowledged. However, the author's action might have escalated the situation beyond a private resolution. \n\nIn many cases, privacy laws and ethical standards suggest that sharing private communications without permission, even if in response to a mistake, is generally not acceptable. The author's motivation is understandable, but the method might be problematic. However, some might argue that the public's right to know about systemic issues in admissions could justify it. But without more context on the specific policies or if there were other channels used first, it's hard to say. \n\nThe fact that the coach already apologized and took responsibility might mean that public sharing was unnecessary. The author could have addressed the issue through the university's channels first. By going public, they might be overstepping, even if their sister's feelings are valid.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because sharing private emails publicly without consent can be ethically wrong, regardless of intent. However, there's a middle ground where the situation is complex. But based on standard ethical considerations, publicizing private communications is generally not acceptable.\n"
