I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the head swimming coach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister applied to a university, got an email from the coach saying she was accepted, leading the family to believe she got in. But it turned out to be a mistake. The coach sent the same message to others who were actually accepted, and this was an error. The family was upset, and the author posted the emails online to raise awareness about the mistake and the university's handling of the situation. Some people, including students from the university's swim team, are saying the author was wrong to publicize the emails.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the coach make a mistake, and was it appropriate for the author to share the emails publicly? The coach apologized, saying it was an error. The author's intention was to inform others to prevent similar issues. But sharing private emails can have consequences, like damaging the coach's reputation or the university's. However, the coach admitted fault, so maybe the author's action was a way to hold them accountable. On the other hand, releasing personal communications without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent was good.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often considers the intentions and the impact. The author's goal was to highlight a mistake that caused harm to their sister. Publicizing the emails might be justified to warn others, but it could also be seen as exposing someone's error without knowing the full context. However, since the coach already acknowledged the mistake, the author might have a valid point in wanting to raise awareness. Alternatively, the university might have their own process for handling such errors, and public exposure could be unnecessary.\n\nI should also think about privacy. Even if the emails were part of a mistake, sharing them publicly could be problematic. But since the coach admitted fault, maybe the author is justified in using the screenshots to show the university's responsibility. The swim team members might be defensive because they're associated with the coach, hence their opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was to protect their sister's experience and prevent others from being in the same situation. While sharing private emails can be sensitive, the coach's error is clear. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to inform the public about a systemic issue. However, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The answer might be B (No), as the author acted to bring attention to a legitimate problem, even if the method was public exposure.\n"
