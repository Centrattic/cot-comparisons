I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email thread between their sister and the swim coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told she was accepted by a university through a coach's email, but it was a mistake. The coach later admitted to sending the wrong email. The author then took screenshots of the emails and posted them on social media to raise awareness about the mistake and get others to understand their disappointment. However, some people, especially current students and swimmers, are upset that the author publicized the emails.\n\nThe key points here are: the coach made a mistake, which caused emotional harm to the sister. The author's response was to publicize the emails. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. Publicizing private communications can be a violation of privacy, even if the intent is to share a story. However, the author's motivation was to highlight a mistake that affected their sister. There's a conflict between the right to privacy and the public's interest in accountability.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that the coach's mistake is a systemic issue that needs to be exposed to prevent similar situations. On the other hand, releasing private emails without consent can harm the coach's reputation and potentially lead to other consequences. The coach did apologize, which might indicate some accountability, but the author's action could be seen as retaliation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is a family member might affect the perception. The family's emotional response is valid, but using public shaming could be considered inappropriate. There's also the aspect of whether the author gave the university or coach a chance to address the issue privately before going public.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, sharing emails without consent could violate privacy laws depending on the jurisdiction. Ethically, there's a debate between the right to privacy and the right to free speech. However, the author's intent was to advocate for their sister, which could be seen as justifiable, but the method might be questionable.\n\nAnother angle is that the author's action could harm the university's reputation and the coach's career, which might be seen as disproportionate to the mistake. The coach did apologize, so maybe the author should have sought a private resolution first.\n\nHowever, considering the emotional distress caused to the sister and the public nature of college admissions, the author might feel that public attention is necessary to ensure accountability and prevent future mistakes. It's a tough balance between personal ethics and public action.\n\nIn conclusion, there are arguments on both sides. But typically, publicizing private communications without consent is generally considered wrong unless there's a significant public interest. Since this is a personal matter, even if the coach made a mistake, the author's action might cross ethical boundaries. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
