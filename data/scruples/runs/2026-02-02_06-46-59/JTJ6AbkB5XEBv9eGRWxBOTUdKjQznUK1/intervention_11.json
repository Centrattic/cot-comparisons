I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the swimming coach. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister got a fake acceptance from the coach, leading her to believe she was admitted and then to be devastated when it wasn't. The author then posted the emails publicly on social media, causing controversy. The question is whether sharing those emails without the coach's consent was wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the coach made a mistake that caused harm to the sister. The author might argue that by publicizing the emails, they're exposing the coach's error and the university's lack of accountability, which is in the public interest, especially given the ongoing scrutiny around college admissions. This could be seen as a form of whistleblowing if there's systemic negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach's emails might be considered private. Even if the author has a grievance, sharing them without consent could breach privacy or confidentiality. The coach might have personal or professional reasons to keep those communications private. Additionally, public shaming could have repercussions on the coach's career and the university's reputation. The author might also be infringing on the coach's right to privacy, even if the intention is to correct a wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the sister. The author's motivation is to prevent others from experiencing the same harm. However, the method of achieving that by exposing private emails might not be the most ethical approach. There might be alternative ways to address the issue, like contacting the university's administration or media outlets for a more formal approach.\n\nLegal considerations could also play a role. If the emails were sent in a professional capacity, there might be policies about releasing such information. Depending on the jurisdiction, sharing private emails could lead to legal issues like breach of confidentiality, unless there's a public interest exception.\n\nThe responses from the students on the swim team suggest that the author's actions might be seen as unfair, possibly harming the coach's reputation without due process. The author's decision to share the emails publicly might be seen as a form of vigilante justice, which can have unintended consequences.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention to highlight a mistake and prevent future issues is understandable, the method of publicly sharing private emails without consent likely breaches ethical and possibly legal boundaries. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
