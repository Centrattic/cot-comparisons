I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange between their sister and the head swimming coach. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted into the university, which turned out to be a mistake. The author took screenshots of the email and posted them online to highlight the university's mishandling, but others, including some students, are upset about the public exposure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The coach made a human error, which caused emotional distress to the sister. The author's intent was to raise awareness and prevent others from going through the same issue. However, by posting the emails publicly, the author might have exposed the coach and the university, potentially violating privacy or not giving them a chance to address the mistake internally. \n\nOn one hand, the author's actions could be seen as justified because they were trying to hold the university accountable and support their sister. On the other hand, public shaming through social media might be considered harsh, especially if the coach had already apologized. The author didn't give the university a chance to correct the situation before going public, which could be seen as exacerbating the problem rather than resolving it.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. The coach might face disciplinary action, and the university's reputation could be damaged. The sister's privacy might also be compromised if personal emails are shared. While the author's intentions are understandable, using public exposure immediately without seeking a resolution through proper channels (like contacting the admissions office or the university's administration) might be where they went wrong. \n\nIn similar situations, people often suggest that before going public, one should try to address the issue directly. The coach did apologize, so the university might have had a process to handle the mistake. The author's public shaming could be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial mistake was the coach's. \n\nAlso, the other students' perspective is that they are on the swim team and might fear how this public exposure affects their own experiences with the coach or university. The author's action could be perceived as damaging to the community, even if the original error was regrettable.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's intent was to advocate for their sister, but the method might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they chose to publicize the emails without exhausting other options first.\n"
