I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they did the wrong thing by posting their sister's email exchange with a college swim coach on social media. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which caused her a lot of emotional distress when the official acceptance didn't come. The family is upset, and the author took screenshots to publicize it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coach made an error, which is unfortunate. The author's intention is to highlight the issue so others are aware and to prevent similar situations. However, sharing private emails without consent is a big deal. Even if the author had good intentions, their sister might not have given permission to use her personal communication. That could be a violation of her privacy.\n\nThen there's the impact. The two students on the swim team argue that sharing this publicly could harm the coach's reputation and maybe the university. They might also think that the author is overreacting or that the coach's mistake doesn't justify public exposure. The author believes that the students are biased in favor of the coach. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to support their sister and seek accountability. If the coach was negligent, maybe they should face some consequences. But the key point here is whether the author had the right to publish the emails. The coach's apology mentions that he was in the process of planning visits with recruits, which is a common practice, but still, sending a premature acceptance email was a mistake.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences of publicizing the emails. It might lead to embarrassment for the coach or the university, but the author is using it to explain their sister's disappointment. However, the sister's emotional state could be worsened if her private interactions are shared. The family's right to vent their frustration is important, but they have to respect privacy and the possibility of due process for the coach.\n\nAnother angle: even if the coach was at fault, the author took it upon themselves to expose it publicly without perhaps consulting the sister first. That could be a problem. The sister might not want her application details out there, especially if she feels vulnerable.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, regardless of the intention. The right to privacy is a strong factor here. Even though the situation is unfortunate, the method of addressing it could be questionable. The answer might lean towards A, but maybe there's a nuance. Wait, the coach's mistake was real, and the author is trying to hold the school accountable. But is public shaming the appropriate way? There's a difference between seeking accountability and violating privacy. \n\nIn most cases, sharing personal emails without consent is a breach of privacy, even if you're trying to make a point. The author could have contacted the university's administration directly or sought advice on how to handle it without public exposure. By posting it, they might have acted impulsively, which can have negative repercussions. Also, the sister might not want her personal story shared, which the author didn't consider. The students on the team might not be biased; they could be concerned about the coach's well-being or following school policies on such matters. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong for sharing private emails publicly without considering the implications and without the sister's consent.\n"
