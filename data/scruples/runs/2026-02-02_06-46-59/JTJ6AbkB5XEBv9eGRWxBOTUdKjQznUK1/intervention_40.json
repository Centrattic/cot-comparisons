I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who publicized their sister's email exchange with the coach is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister being mistakenly led to believe she was accepted by the university, which caused her emotional distress. The author took screenshots of the emails and posted them on social media to highlight the university's mistake and advocate for other student-athletes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coach made a mistake, which is unfortunate, but did the author have the right to share private emails publicly? Privacy is a key factor here. Even if the intent was to expose a mistake, sharing personal communications without consent can be problematic. The coach's emails might be considered confidential or at least not intended for public consumption. \n\nThen, there's the impact of the author's actions. While the sister's experience is heartbreaking, public shaming or exposing someone's error can have consequences beyond the initial mistake. The coach's personal and professional reputation could be at stake, and perhaps they have apologized. The author's intent was to prevent others from similar experiences, but is there a better way to handle it without publicizing the emails?\n\nAlso, the response from others, like current students, suggests that the author might be overstepping. The students might feel that the coach is being unfairly targeted, and the public sharing could affect the entire university's reputation. However, the author's argument is that the university's practices need to be scrutinized to prevent future mistakes.\n\nLegal considerations might come into play too. If the emails were shared without permission, there could be issues related to privacy laws or defamation, depending on the jurisdiction. Even if not illegal, it's a matter of ethical judgment whether it's right to share such information.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's emotional distress is significant. The coach's mistake caused her undue stress, and the family felt they needed to make their story public to raise awareness. The author might believe that the ends justify the means, that the public needs to know about such errors in the admissions process.\n\nBut is publicizing the emails the appropriate response? Maybe not. Other avenues, like contacting the university directly, seeking a formal apology or policy change, or working with advocacy groups, could be more constructive. Public exposure might lead to the coach losing their job or facing disciplinary action, which could be harsh if the mistake was unintentional.\n\nIn summary, while the coach's error was a serious issue, the author's decision to share private emails publicly could be seen as an overreaction. Respecting privacy and using more appropriate channels might have been the right approach, even if the intent was to help others. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
