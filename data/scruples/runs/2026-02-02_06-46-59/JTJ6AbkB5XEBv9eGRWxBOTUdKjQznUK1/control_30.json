I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong for sharing the email exchange between their sister and the coach publicly. The situation involves a mix-up where the coach mistakenly emailed the sister thinking she was accepted, leading to false hope, and then a public response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. He admitted to sending the wrong email to the sister, which caused emotional distress. The family's reaction is understandable\u2014this is a stressful time for students, and a mistake like this can be really hurtful. The author's action was to share the email thread on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from similar experiences.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent and impact. The author's intent was to shed light on a problem in the admissions process and support their sister. However, sharing private communications publicly can raise privacy concerns. The coach's emails were part of a mix-up, not a deliberate deception. Publicizing this might damage the coach's reputation, even if unintentional, and could affect his career. \n\nOn the other hand, the family believes the university should be held accountable, and the author is trying to bring attention to a systemic issue. But does that justify breaching privacy? The coach's response was an apology, and the author's action might be seen as escalating the situation beyond what's necessary. The other swimmers at the university might have a vested interest in protecting the coach, but their opinion on the privacy aspect isn't the only factor.\n\nLegal considerations come into play too. Sharing someone's private emails without consent could be a violation of privacy laws, depending on the jurisdiction. Even if the intent is good, the act itself could be legally questionable. Ethically, while the family has a right to be upset, the method of addressing the issue through public shaming might be excessive. The author could have approached the university formally or sought media attention through proper channels instead of personal social media posts.\n\nIn some cases, exposing a mistake to prevent future harm is justified, but it's a balance between accountability and respecting privacy. The author's action might have been a way to vent frustration and seek justice, but it's possible that they overstepped by making the emails public. The coach's error, while serious, might not warrant public exposure without legal or institutional channels. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering the privacy and potential repercussions of sharing such sensitive information.\n"
