I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who shared their sister's emails is in the wrong. The situation involves a mix-up by a coach where he mistakenly told the sister she was accepted into the university, leading to her being rejected later. The family is upset, and the author posted the emails online to publicize the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The coach made an error, but was it intentional? He admitted to sending the wrong email, which might suggest it was a genuine mistake. However, the impact on the sister was significant\u2014emotional distress from false hope. The author's response was to go public with the emails. \n\nNow, the question is about whether this action is justified. Public shaming or exposing private communications can be a gray area. On one hand, the coach's mistake had real consequences, and the family felt the university needed to be held accountable. On the other hand, the emails might be private, and sharing them without consent could be a breach of privacy, regardless of the intent. \n\nAlso, the swimmers and the university might argue that the author's action could harm the coach's reputation unfairly, even if it was a mistake. The family's anger is valid, but does that justify public exposure? \n\nLegal aspects might come into play too. If the emails were confidential, sharing them could lead to legal issues. However, the story is framed as a public interest case, aiming to prevent others from similar experiences. \n\nIn terms of morality, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's intent was to highlight a systemic issue, but the method involved using personal information. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong if the intent was to raise awareness, but there's a risk of overstepping by sharing private emails. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might depend on the justification for sharing. If the author's action was to inform the public about a systemic problem and the coach's accountability, then maybe it's understandable. However, if it's about personal revenge or public shaming without a broader purpose, it's more questionable. The coach's apology and the university's process might also influence whether the exposure is necessary. \n\nI think the key points are the intent behind sharing the emails and the potential harm caused. If the author's actions were to prevent others from similar situations and the emails were shared responsibly (without doxxing or malicious intent), then it might not be in the wrong. However, if it's seen as an invasion of privacy or a way to publicly humiliate the coach regardless of the mistake, then it's in the wrong. \n\nGiven the context provided, the author's position is that the university and coach need to be held accountable for the mistake that affected their sister. The public sharing is a means to an end. So, depending on the perspective, the author might not be in the wrong. However, others might argue that the method is inappropriate regardless of the intent. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer could swing either way, but given the justification for public accountability and the coach's admitted mistake, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But if the privacy breach is considered more important, then they are. The answer likely depends on the ethical framework applied.\n"
