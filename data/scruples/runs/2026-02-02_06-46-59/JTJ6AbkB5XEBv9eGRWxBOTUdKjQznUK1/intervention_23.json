I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for publicizing the emails between their sister and the head swimming coach. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the sister was applying to her dream school, and the coach mistakenly told her she was accepted before she actually was. This led to her being elated and then devastated when she found out the truth. The author, wanting to hold the university accountable, posted the email thread on social media. Now, some people are saying the author is wrong to do that, especially the current students on the swim team. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, which was an error. The sister was misled, which caused emotional distress. The author's intent was to highlight the university's mistake and prevent it from happening to others. But by publishing the emails, the author is exposing the coach's error publicly, which could have consequences for the coach and the university.\n\nOn one hand, the author's motivation is to protect other student-athletes and seek justice for their sister's experience. On the other hand, publishing such emails might infringe on the coach's privacy or affect their professional reputation, even if it was a mistake. Also, the current students argue that the author's actions are unjust, possibly out of self-interest or bias against the coach.\n\nI should also consider if the author had other options, like reporting the issue to the university administration or media outlets without publicly shaming the coach. Publicly sharing the emails could be seen as a form of doxxing or public shaming, which is often frowned upon unless it's to expose serious wrongdoing. The coach's mistake was a miscommunication, not a malicious act. However, the impact on the student was significant.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's emotional state. The author's action was to support their sister and prevent others from going through the same trauma. But does that justify making the coach the villain? Maybe the university has internal processes to handle such errors, and public exposure could interfere with that.\n\nAlso, the author might have overstepped by not giving the university a chance to address the issue privately before going public. However, if the university isn't responsive, publicizing the issue might be seen as necessary. The line between holding institutions accountable and violating privacy/professional boundaries is thin here.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were driven by a desire to prevent others from suffering the same mistake and to seek accountability. However, the method of publicizing the emails without considering the coach's position or seeking alternative resolutions might be where the mistake lies. So, while the intent is understandable, the action could be seen as inconsiderate of the coach's situation and potentially unhelpful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
