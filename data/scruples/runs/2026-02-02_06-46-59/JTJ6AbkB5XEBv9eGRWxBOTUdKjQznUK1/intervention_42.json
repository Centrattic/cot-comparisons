I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the swim coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was mistakenly told she was accepted into the university by the coach, which led to her being excited. But then she wasn't actually accepted. The family is upset, and the author shared the emails publicly to highlight the mistake and show why they're disappointed. Some people, including students at the university, are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether publishing the emails was justified. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the coach made a mistake that caused emotional distress to the student. The author wants to hold the university accountable and prevent similar situations for others. Publicizing the emails could be seen as exposing wrongdoing and advocating for transparency, especially in a system that's under public scrutiny (college admissions). The author's intention is to raise awareness and prevent future issues, which might be seen as a public good.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could violate privacy. The coach's side might have their own perspective or reasons for the mistake that aren't fully explained. By going public, the author could be damaging the coach's reputation and causing harm beyond just the mistake. The coach did apologize, so maybe the author's response was too harsh, especially since the coach might have faced internal consequences. Also, the people on the swim team might feel that the author is unfairly targeting the coach, affecting their standing or the team's reputation.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could lead to a loss of trust in the university, which might not be justified if the mistake was an honest one. However, if the university's process is flawed, exposing it could lead to necessary changes. But the author might not have given the university a chance to address the issue through proper channels first.\n\nIs there a middle ground? The family could have approached the university formally to address the mistake and seek accountability without publicizing the emails. Public shaming or exposing others might not be the best way to resolve the issue and could lead to legal issues if privacy or defamation laws are involved.\n\nAlso, the impact on the coach and the university: even if the mistake was honest, sharing the emails publicly makes it a public relations issue. The coach's employer (the university) might handle it internally, but the author's actions complicate that. The coach might lose their job or face disciplinary action, which could be disproportionate to the mistake if it was an honest error.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's intent was to protect their sister and prevent others from being harmed, which is understandable. But the method of achieving that\u2014public exposure\u2014might not be the most appropriate. There's also the question of whether the author has the right to speak on behalf of their sister, especially if the sister didn't consent to sharing the emails.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are sympathetic, the method of publicizing the emails might be considered wrong because it invades the coach's privacy, could lead to reputational harm without due process, and might not be the most effective way to address the issue. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of these factors.\n"
