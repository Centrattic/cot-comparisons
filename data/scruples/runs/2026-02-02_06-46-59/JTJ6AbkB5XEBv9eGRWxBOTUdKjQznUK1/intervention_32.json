I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange between their sister and the swim coach. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, leading her to believe she got in, but then she didn't. The author shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coach made an error, which is unfortunate and possibly unprofessional. However, the author took screenshots of the email thread and posted them on social media. The key question here is whether publishing private communications without consent is wrong.\n\nThe coach's email was a personal communication intended for the student. By sharing it publicly, the author is revealing private information. Even if the intent was to hold the university accountable, the method might cross ethical boundaries. The family's frustration is valid, but using public shaming could harm the coach's reputation beyond what's necessary.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of privacy. The sister might have consented to the emails being shared if she was involved, but the example doesn't mention her consent. The author decided unilaterally to post the emails, which could be a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the university's actions were harmful to the student. The coach's mistake affected her college application process and mental health. The author's motivation to prevent similar incidents is understandable, but the method of sharing private emails might not be the best approach. There might be other ways to address the issue, like contacting the university's administration or media outlets while respecting privacy.\n\nThe response from the current students suggests that publicizing this could harm the swim team's reputation without addressing the root problem. The author might have overstepped by exposing individuals involved instead of focusing on systemic issues.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent is to highlight a problem, the method of using private emails without consent likely makes them at fault. So, the answer would be A.\n"
