I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their sister was mistakenly told she was accepted into a university by the head swimming coach. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, sending the wrong email. The author then publicized the email thread on social media to highlight the issue and support their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons for and against the author's actions. On one side, the coach made an error that caused emotional distress to the sister. The family is upset, and by sharing the emails, the author is trying to hold the university accountable and prevent this from happening to others. This could be seen as a legitimate effort to bring attention to a systemic issue, especially since college admissions are in the news a lot.\n\nOn the other side, publicizing private emails without permission could be a privacy violation. The coach might have had good intentions but made a mistake, and the author's actions could damage the coach's reputation or job. Also, the other students who are athletes might feel that the author is unfairly targeting the coach, which could affect their own standing or relationships within the university.\n\nI should also think about the intent. The author's main goal was to support their sister and prevent similar mistakes. However, using public shaming might not be the most effective or ethical approach. There might be other ways to address the issue without exposing private communications, like contacting the university directly or through official channels.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the sister. Even though the author's intention was to help, putting the emails online could put additional pressure on her or cause further emotional harm. It might also lead to a backlash from the university or the coach, which the family might not want.\n\nLegal aspects: In some places, sharing someone's private emails without consent could be illegal, even if the intent is good. However, if the emails were between the sister and the coach, and the author obtained them through legitimate means (since they were part of the communication), maybe it's a gray area. But publicizing them could still be problematic.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author might feel justified in exposing the mistake to protect others, but others might see this as crossing a line by airing private matters publicly.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they publicly shared private emails, potentially violating privacy and causing harm to the coach's reputation. However, the intent was to highlight a serious issue that affected their sister. But the method used might not be appropriate. So, considering all factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the public shaming is questionable despite good intentions.\n"
