I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister getting falsely led to believe she was accepted into a university through a mistake by the swim coach. The author then publicized the email exchange on social media. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal implications. The coach made an error, which caused emotional distress to the sister. The author's response was to share the emails publicly. On one hand, they might feel justified in wanting to expose the mistake to prevent it from happening to others. On the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could be a violation of privacy and might be seen as damaging to the coach's reputation.\n\nI should think about the intent. The author's goal was to bring attention to the university's mistake and support their sister. However, public shaming can have consequences. The coach did issue an apology, so the author might have had other avenues to address the issue, like legal action or contacting the university's administration directly.\n\nAlso, the emails are between the coach and the sister. By sharing them publicly, the author is disclosing private communication. Even if the sister is okay with it, the coach might not be, leading to potential defamation or privacy issues. \n\nThe people at the university, especially the swimmers, might feel the author is overstepping, which the author acknowledges as biased. But is the author justified in their actions? It's a balance between accountability and privacy. \n\nIn some cases, exposing misconduct is appropriate, but here the mistake might not be malicious. The coach admitted it was an error. The author's public shaming could be harsher than necessary. \n\nPossible angles: The author's actions could be seen as necessary to highlight the university's negligence, but also as an invasion of privacy. Legal perspective: Depending on the jurisdiction, sharing emails without consent could be problematic. \n\nEthically, is the author's action a form of seeking justice or retaliation? The sister's emotional harm is significant, but the author's method might not be the most appropriate. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, there's a case for both A and B. However, the decision hinges on whether the public disclosure was justified. Since the author's intent was to inform others and hold the university accountable, but the method involved sharing private emails, it's possible they're in the wrong for breaching privacy, even if the situation was wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's a nuanced case where both sides have valid points. However, based on typical guidelines, sharing private communications without consent is generally not advised, so the answer is likely A.\n"
