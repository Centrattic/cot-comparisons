I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for publicizing emails between their sister and a college coach. The sister got a false acceptance email from the coach, leading to emotional distress when the actual acceptance didn't come through. The author took screenshots and posted them online to share their sister's disappointment and highlight the university's mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. He sent an email to applicants and those accepted, mixing them up. That's an error, but does it justify public shaming? The family's frustration is understandable\u2014this was a significant emotional rollercoaster for the sister. The author's intention was to raise awareness and prevent others from similar experiences. However, sharing private emails publicly can have consequences beyond the intended effect.\n\nOn one hand, the coach made a genuine mistake, and the family is upset. On the other hand, releasing private communications might harm the coach's reputation and the university's image, even if the mistake was unintentional. The people who commented, like the current students, might feel the author overstepped by using the emails to make a public statement, potentially affecting others (like teammates) unfairly.\n\nThe question is about whether the author's publicizing the emails is wrong. The coach apologized, acknowledging his error. The author's action was meant to highlight the issue, but there might be other ways to address it without public exposure. Public shaming can sometimes be disproportionate, even if the situation is frustrating. The author might not have considered the broader implications of sharing private emails, which could lead to misunderstandings or unnecessary harm to the coach's career, even if he made a mistake.\n\nSo, while the coach's error is inexcusable, the author's response of publicizing the emails could be seen as crossing a line. The family's emotional response is valid, but the method of addressing it via social media might not be the most appropriate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking that action.\n"
