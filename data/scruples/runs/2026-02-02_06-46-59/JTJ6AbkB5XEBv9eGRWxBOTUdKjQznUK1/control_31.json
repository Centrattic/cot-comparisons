I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister getting falsely told she was accepted to a university through a mistake by the swim coach. The author then publicized the email exchange on social media. The question is whether they did the wrong thing by doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The sister was led to believe she was accepted because the coach sent an email to people who had applied and those who were accepted, but mixed up the messages. The family was ecstatic, only to find out later that there was a mistake. The author took screenshots and posted them publicly to highlight the university's mishandling and to prevent others from going through the same experience.\n\nNow, the people arguing against the author say that the swimmers at the university don't understand the sister's situation and are biased towards the coach. But the author's reasoning is that they want to raise awareness and hold the university accountable. \n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider factors like privacy, intent, and the consequences. Did the author have the right to share the emails without permission? The emails were between the sister and the coach, so sharing them publicly could breach privacy. However, the author's intention was to expose a mistake that caused harm to their sister. \n\nOn one hand, publicizing private emails might be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the intent was good. It could harm the coach's reputation and potentially lead to legal issues like defamation if the emails are taken out of context. Also, the university might have policies against such public sharing. \n\nOn the other hand, the situation caused significant emotional distress to the sister, and the author felt compelled to share the story to prevent similar incidents for others. The coach admitted fault, but the university's handling of the situation might be at fault as well. \n\nHowever, the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, might have been a knee-jerk reaction. Instead of publicly shaming through social media, they could have sought other remedies like contacting the university's administration to address the issue formally. Public exposure without exhausting other options could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nAlso, the fact that the two swimmers are defending the coach doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong, but it does show that others might see the publicizing as unfair. The author's action could damage reputations beyond just the coach, affecting the university's image and possibly the swimmers if the context is misunderstood. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's intent was to hold the university accountable, but the method might have been problematic. It's a gray area, but in many cases, public shaming without due process can be considered inconsiderate or even harmful. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private communications publicly, which can be seen as a breach of privacy and potentially defamation, even if the intention was to highlight a legitimate issue. They might have other avenues to address the problem without going public. However, if the coach's actions were indeed a clear mistake, the author's intent to prevent future harm is understandable. But ultimately, the act of publishing screenshots without consent is where the line is crossed.\n"
