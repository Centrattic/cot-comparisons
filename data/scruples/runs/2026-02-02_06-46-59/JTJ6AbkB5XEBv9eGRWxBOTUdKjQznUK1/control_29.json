I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's sister who got an email from a swim coach at her dream school. The coach mistakenly told her she was accepted, which wasn't true. The family was excited, and then when the official letter didn't come, they found out it was a mistake. The author then posted the email thread publicly to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons why the author did this. Their sister was really stressed about college admissions and her swimming future. The coach's error caused a lot of emotional distress. The author wants to raise awareness so that other students don't go through the same thing. On the other hand, releasing private emails without consent could be a privacy violation, especially if it's the coach's personal mistake.\n\nThe university's process here seems to have a flaw. The coach mixed up emails between applicants and accepted students. That's a big problem, but the author's response is to publicize the emails. The question is whether this public shaming is justified. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to bring attention to a systemic issue that affected their sister. On the other hand, making the emails public might have consequences for the coach, like losing their job or damaging their reputation. The university might have their own way of handling this, and the author stepping in could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the other students (like the swimmers) argue that publicizing this is wrong. They might be biased in favor of the coach, but maybe they have a point about privacy. The author's sister was the one wronged, but the method of exposing the issue could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have contacted the university's administration first instead of going public. That way, the issue could be dealt with internally, and if no action was taken, then maybe publicizing it would be justified. But the author might not have trusted the university to handle it properly. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing private communications without permission is generally considered wrong, even if the intent is good. However, the emotional harm caused by the coach's mistake is significant. There's a balance between accountability and privacy. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for violating privacy, but their intentions were to help others. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if the coach's actions were unethical and needed to be exposed. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the key factors are: the violation of privacy by sharing emails, the intent to bring attention to a problem, and the potential consequences for the coach. If the author had a legitimate reason to believe the university wouldn't address the issue, maybe it's justified. But if they just wanted to publicly shame, it's not. \n\nIn this case, the author mentions that the family is furious and the sister is upset. They wanted to ensure others don't face the same issue. Maybe they felt public pressure was necessary. However, the act of releasing private emails is a breach of trust unless authorized. So, the author is in the wrong (A) for publicizing the emails without consent, regardless of the intent. Even with good reasons, it's a privacy violation.\n"
