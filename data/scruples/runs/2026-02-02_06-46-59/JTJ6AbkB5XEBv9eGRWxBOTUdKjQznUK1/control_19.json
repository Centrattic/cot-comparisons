I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister who publicized emails between her younger sister and a university swim coach. The coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The family was upset, and the author put the emails on social media to make their case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The coach made an error, which caused emotional distress to the student. The family's reaction is understandable\u2014they were excited based on the false information. The author's action was to share the email thread publicly. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, sharing private communications without consent might breach privacy. The coach and the sister might have expected their emails to be private. Publicizing them could be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if the intention was to highlight a mistake. Also, the coach might have a valid reason for the error, but that doesn't justify airing personal emails publicly.\n\nOn the other hand, the family was wronged and felt the need to inform others to prevent similar issues. The author argues that the university's system failed and wants to raise awareness. There's a public interest here, especially regarding college admissions and how universities handle communications. The fact that some people at the university are biased in favor of the coach suggests there might be a cover-up or lack of accountability.\n\nAnother angle is intent. The author's intention was to advocate for their sister and warn others. However, the method of sharing private information could be problematic. Even if the cause is just, using public shaming or exposing private emails might not be the appropriate course of action. It could lead to further harm, like damaging the coach's reputation without due process or making the sister uncomfortable if her emails were shared without her full consent.\n\nAlso, the sister's consent is a factor. Did the younger sister agree to the emails being public? If the author took screenshots without the sister's permission, that might be another issue. The family's response was to contact the coach, so maybe the public sharing was an escalation.\n\nThere's a balance between holding institutions accountable and respecting privacy. The author might believe that the public needs to know about the university's mistake, but there are other ways to address it, like formal complaints or contacting the administration. Public shaming can sometimes be counterproductive, as it might lead to defensiveness rather than constructive solutions.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they shared private information without consent, which is a breach of privacy. However, their motivation was to highlight a legitimate issue. The ethical dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. Since the correct approach would be to address the issue through proper channels rather than public exposure, the author might be in the wrong. But if the university isn't responsive, public pressure might be necessary. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just whether there are valid arguments on both sides. Given that sharing private emails without consent is generally considered a violation of privacy, even if the intent is good, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
