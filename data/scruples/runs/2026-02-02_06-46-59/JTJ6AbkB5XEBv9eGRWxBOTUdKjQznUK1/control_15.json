I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange between their sister and the swimming coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was accepted to her dream school's swim team based on an email from the coach, but it turned out to be a mistake. The family was excited, then devastated when the actual acceptance didn't come through. The author then shared the email thread publicly on social media to highlight the issue and warn others about the university's handling of the situation. However, some people, including students at the university, are saying the author is wrong to do this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the coach's mistake caused emotional distress to the sister, and the author's response was to go public. The question is whether this action was appropriate or not.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to shed light on what they see as a problem in the admissions process, possibly to prevent similar issues for others. Publicizing the emails could be a way to hold the university accountable and show the error in their communication.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could be seen as a privacy violation. The coach might have had legitimate reasons for the mistake, like a clerical error, and public shaming could be inappropriate. Also, the other students and athletes might argue that the author is damaging the coach's reputation or the university's image without giving them a chance to address the issue privately.\n\nAnother angle is the intent vs. impact. The author's intent was protective of their sister and to raise awareness. However, the impact could be that the coach is unfairly targeted, or that the university's mistake is overblown. It's also possible that the university has processes in place to handle such errors, and public exposure might not be the right approach.\n\nLegal considerations might include whether the emails were confidential. If the emails were between the coach and the student, sharing them without permission could breach confidentiality. Ethically, the author is trying to advocate for their sister, but there's a line between advocacy and public shaming.\n\nAlso, the coach did apologize, taking responsibility for the mistake. The author's publicizing could be seen as disregarding that apology and escalating the situation. But the family's frustration is valid given the emotional toll on the sister.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's actions were justified in this case. If the university's process is flawed and the author's public sharing brings attention to systemic issues, it might be justified. However, if it's a simple mistake without malicious intent, public exposure might be excessive.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions stem from a desire to protect their sister and prevent others from similar harm. However, the method of using public shaming and sharing private emails could be considered over the top, especially if the coach already took responsibility. The answer might depend on the balance between the intent to advocate and the potential harm to the coach's reputation. Considering these points, I think the answer might be B, that the author is not in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some might argue for A if they prioritize privacy and due process over public awareness.\n"
