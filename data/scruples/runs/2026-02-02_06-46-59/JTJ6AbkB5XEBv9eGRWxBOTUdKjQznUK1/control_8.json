I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story (the author) is at fault for sharing the email exchange between their sister and the coach publicly.\n\nFirst, the situation: The coach mistakenly sent an acceptance message to the sister before the university actually accepted her. The family was misled, leading to emotional distress when the acceptance didn't come through. The author then posted the email thread on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The coach admitted fault for sending the wrong email, which was an honest mistake. The author's intention was to raise awareness and possibly prevent similar incidents, but by publishing the emails, they might have invaded the coach's privacy or breached confidentiality. \n\nBut is it ethical? The sister was a minor when this happened, so sharing personal communications could have legal and ethical implications. Also, even if the coach made a mistake, the author's public shaming could affect the coach's reputation and career without due process. However, the author's argument is that they were trying to protect their sister and inform others, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the university and the coach should have proper procedures to prevent such errors. The author's action might have been a way to hold the institution accountable. However, using public shaming without giving the coach a chance to address it formally could be seen as harsh.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author's action was driven by protecting their sister's experience, but the method involved exposing private communications, which could be seen as a privacy violation. The coach's mistake was acknowledged, but public exposure without a formal process might not be the right approach.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit tricky. But in terms of ethical standards, sharing private emails publicly without consent can be problematic, even if the intent is good. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A). However, some might argue that the coach's negligence justifies the action. But legally and ethically, publicizing such information without consent is usually frowned upon. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
