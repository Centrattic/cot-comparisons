I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for sharing emails between their sister and the swim coach. The sister was excited because the coach said she was accepted, but later it turned out she wasn't. The author posted the emails online to show how unfair it was, but some people, especially current students on the swim team, are saying it's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The coach made a mistake by sending an acceptance message to the sister, but then corrected it. The family was misled and the sister was upset. The author's intent was to make the university accountable to prevent others from similar experiences. But is sharing those emails justified?\n\nPrivacy is a big issue here. The emails are between the sister and the coach, so they might contain personal information. Even if the coach was at fault, posting them publicly without consent could be a privacy violation. The sister might not have wanted her personal communication to be shared, maybe out of embarrassment or other reasons.\n\nAlso, the consequences of publicizing this. The coach apologized, and the university probably dealt with it internally. By sharing the emails, the author might be damaging the coach's reputation further, even if it was a mistake. The current students on the team are upset because it could affect their coach or the school's image, which they might see as unfair.\n\nThere's the aspect of intent. The author wants to highlight the issue, but sharing private emails isn't the right way. Instead of social media, maybe contacting the university's admissions department, or using a more formal channel to address the problem would be better. Social media can be public and sometimes taken out of context, leading to more harm than good.\n\nThe sister's well-being is another point. The author might have acted out of frustration, but the sister was already stressed. Publicizing the emails could add to her distress, even if the intent was to support her. It's important to consider her feelings and whether she agreed to the post.\n\nSo, even though the coach made a mistake, the author's action of sharing the emails without permission might be wrong. It's about balancing the right to privacy against the intent to expose a problem. The correct approach might be to seek resolution through appropriate channels rather than public shaming. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
