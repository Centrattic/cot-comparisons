I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for publicizing the emails between their sister and the head swimming coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the coach that she was accepted, which led the family to believe she got in. But then it turned out she wasn't accepted. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, mixing up applicants who had applied early and those accepted. The author then posted the email thread publicly to highlight the university's mistake and the impact on their sister. The people at the university, including some swimmers, are upset that the author shared the emails.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Was there a breach of privacy by sharing the emails? 2) Did the author have a right to expose this to prevent future issues? 3) Could this public shaming be justified as a form of accountability?\n\nThe coach's mistake caused significant emotional distress to the sister. The author's intention was to make others aware so that no one else goes through the same thing. But sharing private communication without consent might be an invasion of privacy, even if the intention is good.\n\nHowever, the emails might be considered a public concern because they relate to a university's admissions process and their handling of student-athlete recruitment. There's a public interest angle here if the coach's error is systemic or if the university isn't being transparent. But the author could have taken other steps, like reporting the issue to the university administration or a higher-up first, rather than going public.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach took responsibility, and maybe the author's public exposure could damage the coach's reputation or the university's without a fair process. But the coach's own explanation in the email might be documented, and the author's action is a form of whistleblowing to highlight a mistake that affected a student.\n\nThe line between protecting privacy and exposing wrongdoing is thin here. The author's actions might be seen as justified if the public disclosure serves a greater good, but it's also possible that the author overstepped by using social media. The response from the university students suggests that the author's actions were inappropriate, but their bias might be because they benefit from the coach.\n\nI need to consider whether the author's intent and the method of sharing the emails were appropriate. The author's sister was harmed, and the publicizing was a way to advocate for others. However, without the consent of the people involved in the emails, sharing them publicly could be seen as violating their privacy. The coach might have a right to his privacy as well, even if he made a mistake.\n\nIn many cases, exposing someone's private communications can be problematic unless there's a clear public interest or threat. Here, the public interest is about accountability in college admissions, which is a hot topic. But the author might have a case for making the public aware of the coach's error, especially if it's a systemic issue.\n\nBut the coach did take responsibility, and the university might have addressed the issue internally. The author's public shaming could be seen as unnecessary escalation. However, given the emotional impact on the sister and the potential for others to be affected, the author might feel that public exposure was the only way to get attention.\n\nI think the answer is a bit of a toss-up. The author's intent is good, but the method might be questionable. However, in situations like this, where institutions are at fault and the individual seeks justice, some might argue that the author wasn't in the wrong. But others might say that the author should have pursued other avenues first. Since the coach admitted fault, the author might have overstepped by going public without giving the university a chance to handle it privately. But given the public interest in college admissions, maybe it's justified.\n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the intent was to prevent future harm and the coach's mistake was significant, even though the method of sharing might be debatable. The emotional impact on the sister is high, and the author's action is a form of seeking accountability.\n"
