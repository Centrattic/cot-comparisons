I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for publicizing emails between their sister and the swim coach. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister was a high school senior applying to college and was a competitive swimmer. The coach from her dream school sent an email saying she was accepted and that they were interested in her joining the team. The family and sister got excited, but later found out she wasn't accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake\u2014he sent the email to someone who hadn't been accepted, thinking they had. The author took screenshots of the email exchange and posted them publicly on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same experience. However, some people, including current university swimmers, are criticizing the author for doing this, saying it's wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here: \n\n1. The coach made an honest mistake. He mixed up emails between applicants and accepted students. So, it's not that the coach was being deceptive, just an error in communication. \n\n2. The author's sister was emotionally hurt because of this mistake. The author's intent was to bring attention to the university's mistake to prevent others from facing similar issues. \n\n3. The author publicized the emails without the coach's consent. The question is whether that's justified. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might be seen as trying to hold the university accountable, which is a valid concern. However, sharing private emails publicly can have consequences. It could damage the coach's reputation based on a mistake, even if it was unintentional. Also, the coach has a right to privacy, and publicizing such emails might infringe on that. \n\nOn the other hand, the coach's mistake did cause significant emotional harm to the student. The author's intention is to raise awareness and prevent similar mistakes. But is exposing the emails the right way to do that? There might be other avenues, like contacting the university administration or a journalist to handle the story responsibly. \n\nAnother angle: the author's sister's experience is real, but by sharing private communications, there could be unintended consequences. For example, the coach might face disciplinary action based on a mistake, which could be unfair. Also, the public might not know the full context, leading to a negative perception of the university or coach without understanding it was an error.\n\nSo, the author's action is a form of whistleblowing, but it's using public shaming without exhausting other avenues first. Depending on the cultural or situational norms, this could be seen as right or wrong. In some views, the ends justify the means if the intention is to prevent harm. In others, it's a breach of privacy and trust, especially since the emails were private.\n\nAlso, the university might have policies on how such mistakes are addressed. If the author had approached the university first, they might have been able to resolve it without public exposure. However, the family might not have been satisfied with the response, leading them to take matters into their own hands.\n\nI need to consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have shared the story without exposing the emails, just the outcome. But since the emails were the evidence, they needed to be included. Still, sharing private communications can be ethically questionable, even with good intentions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are driven by a desire to protect others, but the method of publicizing private emails might cross a line. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the invasion of privacy and potential harm to the coach, even if the mistake was made.\n"
