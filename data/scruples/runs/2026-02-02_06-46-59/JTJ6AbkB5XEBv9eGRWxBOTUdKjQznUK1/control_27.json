I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong for sharing the emails between their sister and the coach publicly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the coach she was accepted, which made her and the family very happy. But later it turned out she wasn't accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake, sending the wrong email. The author then took screenshots of the email thread and posted them on social media to highlight the university's mistake and show how it affected their sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to publicize the emails? The coach's email was sent to the sister, and the author shared it without the coach's or the sister's consent. Even though the intention was to expose a mistake and help others, sharing private emails can be a privacy violation. \n\nThe coach made an error, but the author's response was to go public. The sister might be a minor, so sharing her personal situation on social media could add to her distress. Also, the author mentions that some people from the university are upset because their names are involved. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to prevent similar situations for other athletes, which is a valid public interest. However, the method of using private emails might not be the best approach. There could be other ways to address this, like contacting the university directly or using the media with less personal information. \n\nLegal aspects might be a concern too. If the emails were private and shared without consent, that could be a breach of privacy or even defamation if the coach's mistake is portrayed as intentional. The author might not have considered the coach's explanation in full or given them a chance to correct it publicly before sharing.\n\nSo, the author's action was an attempt to advocate for their sister and raise awareness, but the method involved sharing private information without consent. That could be seen as wrong because it's an invasion of privacy and might have unintended consequences for the coach and others involved. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
