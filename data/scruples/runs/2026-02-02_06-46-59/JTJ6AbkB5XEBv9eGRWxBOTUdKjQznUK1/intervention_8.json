I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author, who publicized the emails between their sister and the swimming coach, is in the wrong. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The family is upset, and the author posted the emails on social media to highlight the issue. Now others, especially current students, are criticizing the author for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author shared private emails without consent from either the coach or the sister. Even if the intention was to raise awareness about the mistake, releasing personal communication can be a breach of privacy. The coach might have had a genuine error, but the public shaming could affect his reputation and career. Plus, the sister might not want her personal application details to be public, even if it's to get support.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach did make a serious mistake that affected a student's emotional and academic planning. The author's intention was to hold the university accountable and prevent similar issues. However, the method used\u2014publicizing the emails\u2014could be seen as a privacy violation and potentially defamatory if it harms the coach's standing without proper context.\n\nThe coach's apology mentions a mistake, so the author might have felt justified, but sharing private information can still be problematic. There might be legal issues like releasing confidential information. Also, the sister's well-being is a factor; even if she's upset, public exposure could cause further stress.\n\nIn many cases, public shaming without due process isn't advisable. The author could have taken other steps, like reporting the issue to the university's administration or media outlets through appropriate channels, rather than sharing the emails directly. The fact that current students are against it might indicate that the author's actions are seen as overstepping, especially if it impacts others at the university.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author likely acted in the sister's best interest but violated privacy and possibly acted inconsiderately towards the coach's situation. The answer here would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
