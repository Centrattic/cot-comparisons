I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for posting their sister's emails publicly. The situation is that the sister was misled by a coach's email into thinking she was accepted to the university, only to be rejected later. The author then shared the email thread on social media to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, the coach made a mistake by sending an email meant for accepted students to someone who was just applying. That's a clear error on the coach's part. The coach apologized, but the family was clearly hurt. The author's intention was to bring attention to the university's mistake to prevent others from going through the same thing.\n\nBut here's the catch: the author published private emails without the sister's consent. Even if the intention was good, sharing someone else's private communications can be a violation of their privacy. The sister might have trusted the coach and expected their communications to remain confidential. By posting them publicly, the author might have breached that trust.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that some students from the university are upset, possibly because they don't want the coach's mistake to reflect poorly on the school. However, the sister's experience is valid, and the author's action was meant to advocate for her. But the method of using public shaming via social media could be seen as harsh or unnecessary, especially if the issue could have been resolved through other means, like contacting the university directly or through official channels.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach's mistake significantly impacted the sister's emotional well-being. The author might feel that the public exposure is justified to hold the university accountable. However, the line between holding someone accountable and violating privacy can be thin. The author needs to consider if they have the right to share their sister's private emails without her permission, even if the intent is to support her.\n\nIn some cases, sharing such information could lead to legal issues, like invasion of privacy or breach of confidentiality. The coach might have made an error, but the author's response could have unintended consequences, like affecting the coach's career or the university's reputation unjustly. There's also the aspect of proportionality\u2014was the public shaming a reasonable response to an honest mistake?\n\nThe key points here are consent and the method of addressing the issue. The author's sister might not have agreed to the public sharing of their emails, which could be a problem regardless of the intent. Even if the coach was at fault, the sister's privacy and control over her communications matter. The author might have overstepped by not seeking their sister's consent and by using public social media instead of addressing it through appropriate channels.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they publicly shared private information without consent, even if the intention was to support their sister. The right course of action would have been to address the issue privately with the university and let them handle it internally, unless there was a legal or ethical violation that required public attention.\n"
