I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the TMI post is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister received a mistaken email from the coach saying she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The author publicized the email thread online.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coach made an error, and the family was misled. The author's intent was to raise awareness about the issue, perhaps to prevent other students from going through the same thing. But the people at the university, including students, are saying that the author shouldn't have publicized the emails.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the coach's mistake was genuine, and the family was genuinely hurt. Publicizing the emails could be seen as shaming the coach or the university, which might not be fair if the mistake was accidental. However, the author's motivation is to highlight a systemic issue in the college admissions process. \n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails publicly without consent can be problematic. It might violate privacy or be seen as retaliation. But the author argues it's for transparency and accountability. The swimmers defending the coach might have a bias since they benefit from the coach's position.\n\nSo, is there a right or wrong here? It's a bit of a gray area. The coach's error is inexcusable, but the author's action of publishing the emails could have consequences beyond just the immediate parties. Depending on the context, if the author did it in a responsible way\u2014maybe contacting the university first instead of going public\u2014it might be different. But since they went straight to social media, others might see that as overstepping, especially if the coach's mistake was unintentional. The author's actions might have caused unnecessary harm to the coach's reputation or the university's, even if the intent was good. \n\nHowever, the author's sister's emotional distress is significant, and the author felt the need to advocate for accountability. It's a tough call. Some might argue that the author is in the right because the coach's error had real consequences and the author is trying to prevent others from suffering similarly. Others might say the author should have handled it privately.\n\nConsidering the options, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because publicizing private emails, even with good intentions, can cross ethical lines, especially when the mistake was an honest one. But if the author's action is seen as a form of advocacy for transparency, then it's B. Hmm. The key factors are intent, the nature of the mistake, and the impact of the action. The coach apologized, so the mistake was genuine, but the author's public shaming might be excessive. So leaning towards A.\n"
