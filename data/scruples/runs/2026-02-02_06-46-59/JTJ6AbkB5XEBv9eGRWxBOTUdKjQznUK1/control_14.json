I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange between their sister and the head swimming coach. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister was led to believe she got into the university because the coach mistakenly sent an acceptance message. Then, when she actually wasn't accepted, the family was upset. The author took screenshots of the email thread and posted them on social media to highlight the university's mistake.\n\nNow, the key points here. The coach admitted to making a mistake, so it's an honest error. The family was wronged because the sister was emotionally impacted. The author's action was to publicize the emails to make the university accountable and prevent others from facing the same issue. However, others at the university, including students, are saying that the author is wrong for doing so, arguing that the author is invading privacy or that the coach's mistake isn't worth public exposure.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author overstepped by sharing private communications. On one hand, the family has a legitimate grievance here. The coach's error caused significant emotional harm to the sister, and the author wants to bring attention to the issue. Publicizing the emails could be a way to hold the university accountable and prevent similar mistakes in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, the emails are between the sister and the coach, which might be considered private. Sharing them publicly without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the intention is good, there's a question about the method. The coach apologized, so maybe the family could have addressed it through the appropriate channels instead of social media. Additionally, other students on the team might feel that the public exposure could damage the coach's reputation unfairly, especially if they believe the mistake was unintentional.\n\nBut the sister's experience is valid. The stress of college admissions is real, and this mistake added unnecessary trauma. The author's motivation is to prevent others from going through the same thing. However, the method of using social media might be seen as public shaming, which could have consequences beyond the issue at hand. There's a balance between accountability and privacy. \n\nI need to consider if the author had a right to share the emails. If the emails were part of the communication related to a student's application, maybe there's a public interest in ensuring transparency. However, sharing private emails without consent could still be problematic, regardless of the intent. The coach's mistake was acknowledged, so perhaps the family could have requested a formal apology or corrective action instead of going public. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is trying to protect their sister and advocate for her. But they might not have considered the legal or privacy implications of sharing those emails. Even if the intention is noble, the act of publishing private correspondence can be legally questionable. It might also affect the coach's reputation unfairly, especially if the mistake was genuine and not malicious. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the method of publicizing the emails was justified. While the family's frustration is understandable, using social media to expose private communications might be crossing a line, even if the intent was to seek accountability. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not using more appropriate channels and for potentially breaching privacy, even if their intentions were good.\n"
