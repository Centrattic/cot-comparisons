I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sister who publicized emails between her younger sister and a college swimming coach who mistakenly told her she was accepted, but she wasn't. The author of the post put the emails on social media to highlight the university's mistake, but others, including current students, are saying she's wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coach made an error in communication, which caused emotional distress to the sister. The family was upset, and the author took screenshots to share publicly. The key points are: was the coach's mistake malicious or just an error? The coach apologized, blaming a mix-up in emails. The author's action is about exposing the issue to prevent others from going through the same.\n\nOn one hand, the sister was deeply hurt, and the family felt it was important to bring attention to the problem. Publicizing the emails could serve as a warning to other students and hold the university accountable. On the other hand, sharing private emails without consent might violate privacy, even if it's with the intention of justice. The author didn't ask the coach or the sister's permission, which could be a breach of confidentiality. Also, the impact on the coach's reputation and the university's policies on recruitment might be a concern. The other students and swimmers argue that the author is overstepping, possibly making the situation worse for the coach or the university. \n\nThe sister's experience is valid, but the method of addressing it is questionable. While the intention is to highlight a mistake that caused harm, public shaming or exposing private communications can have consequences beyond the initial wrongdoing. It's a balance between accountability and privacy. The coach's error might not be malicious, so the response needs to be proportionate. The author could have approached it through official channels first, like contacting the university's administration to report the issue, rather than going public immediately. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they might be in the wrong because sharing private emails without consent, even with good intentions, can be seen as a privacy violation. However, if the action was to prevent others from being harmed, it's a gray area. But the line is thin between advocacy and invasion of privacy. The fact that the sister was a minor (since she's a high school senior) might also affect whether the author had the right to share the emails. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action, while understandable given the emotional impact, might be ethically questionable due to the breach of privacy. Hence, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
