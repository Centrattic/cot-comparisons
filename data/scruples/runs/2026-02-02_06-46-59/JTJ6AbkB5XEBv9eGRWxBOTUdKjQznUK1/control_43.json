I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is at fault for sharing the email exchange between their sister and the coach publicly.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister was told by the coach she was accepted to the university and that they wanted her on the swim team. The family got excited, but then she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake where he sent the same email to people who had applied and been accepted, mixing them up. The author then put the emails on social media to publicize the university's mistake, leading to backlash from some students at the university and others.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, sharing private emails without consent could be a breach of privacy. The coach's mistake might have been an error, but the author's action of making it public could be seen as violating privacy or maybe even damaging the coach's reputation. Also, there's a possibility that the emails were meant to be confidential, and sharing them might be against university policies or ethical guidelines.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's situation is understandable. The sister went through emotional turmoil because of the mistake, and the author wanted to raise awareness about the university's mishandling. They might argue that publicizing it was necessary to prevent similar incidents and to hold the university accountable, especially since the college admissions process is under scrutiny.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the key points are the breach of privacy and the intent. The author might have shared the emails to highlight a problem, but doing so without the coach's consent and using private correspondence could be problematic. The fact that the coach made a mistake doesn't necessarily justify sharing the emails publicly. There might be other ways to address the issue, like contacting the university's administration or seeking media attention through proper channels rather than social media with screenshots.\n\nAlso, the responses from some students at the university suggest that the author's action might have affected their peers, possibly causing backlash or defending the coach. That could add to the complexity of the situation.\n\nSo, considering ethical and legal aspects, the author might be in the wrong for sharing private communications publicly without consent, even if their intent was to bring attention to a mistake. The privacy of the individuals involved (both the coach and the sister) should be respected, and there are other avenues to address the issue without public exposure.\n"
