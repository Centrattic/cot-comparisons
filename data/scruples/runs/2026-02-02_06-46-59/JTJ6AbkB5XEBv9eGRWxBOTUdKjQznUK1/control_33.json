I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister got an email from the head swimming coach of her dream school saying she was accepted and that the team wanted her to join. The family got excited, but then it turned out to be a mistake. The coach admitted he accidentally emailed the wrong person, mixing up applicants and accepted students. The author then posted the emails publicly on social media to raise awareness about the university's mistake and how it affected their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether publicizing the email thread was justified. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to hold the university accountable and prevent similar situations for others. On the other hand, some people argue that the author shouldn't have shared the emails publicly, especially since some of the individuals involved (like the swim team members) might be affected.\n\nLet me think about the coach's mistake. He sent an email to applicants and accepted students, but mixed them up. He apologized, so there's some accountability from his side. However, the family felt betrayed and wanted to make sure others knew what happened. The author's action was to share the emails publicly, which can be seen as a form of shaming the university and the coach. \n\nNow, the question is whether this action was appropriate. On one side, the family had a legitimate grievance. The mistake caused emotional harm to the sister, and the family felt that the university didn't take sufficient responsibility. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a way to highlight systemic issues in college admissions or the importance of clear communication.\n\nOn the other side, the emails might contain personal information, even if it's about the sister's application. Sharing them publicly could violate privacy, even if the intent is to raise awareness. Also, the people who responded negatively (like the current students) might feel that the author is unfairly targeting the coach and the university, which could harm reputations or create a hostile environment for the swim team. There's also the aspect of due process\u2014if the coach made a mistake, maybe the proper way is to address it through official channels rather than public shaming.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's situation. She was trying to get into her dream school and continue her swimming career. The mistake by the coach directly impacted her emotional state. The author's intent was to support their sister and prevent others from going through the same thing. But public exposure can have consequences beyond the immediate issue\u2014like affecting the coach's career, the university's reputation, and possibly the students who are already part of the team.\n\nI need to consider if the author had alternative ways to address the issue without publicizing the emails. Maybe contacting the university administration formally, or writing a private letter to the coach or admissions office to express their concerns. Public shaming might not be the best approach, even if the intention is good. It could also lead to backlash, as people might think the author is exaggerating or misrepresenting the situation.\n\nAlso, the coach did apologize, so perhaps the family felt that wasn't enough and needed public pressure. However, sharing private emails without consent is a privacy issue. Even if the emails were between the sister and the coach, once they were shared publicly, it's a breach of confidentiality. The sister might have agreed to the author sharing them, but the coach's side could be a different matter. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's action could be seen as justified if the goal was to prevent future mistakes, but it's also possible that it's an overreaction. The key here is whether the publicizing was necessary and the right method. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific policies of the university. In some cases, public accountability is important, but in others, it's better to handle grievances privately. Since the author chose a public approach, some might say that's in the wrong because of the privacy breach and potential harm to others' reputations, even if the intention was good. Others might defend the author for standing up for their sister and raising awareness. \n\nGiven that the question is asking if the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards 'A' (the author is in the wrong) because publicizing private emails without consent can be considered a breach of privacy, regardless of the intent. Even with good intentions, using public shaming might not be the appropriate method to address the issue, especially when there are other avenues available.\n"
