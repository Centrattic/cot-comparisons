I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their sister getting falsely told she was accepted to a university through a coach's email, then being rejected. The sister was really upset, and the author publicized the email thread.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The coach made a mistake by sending an acceptance email to someone who wasn't actually accepted. The family was tricked into thinking she was in, leading to emotional distress. The author then shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue and warn others. But some people, including students from the university's swim team, are saying the author did the wrong thing by going public.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the coach's error was significant and caused harm. The family's reaction is understandable given the stress of college admissions and the false hope created. Publicizing the emails could serve as a warning to prevent similar situations for other students. It might also hold the university accountable for their mistake and the coach's negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails publicly can be seen as a breach of privacy. The coach might have had a valid reason to contact the applicant, even if there was a mistake. The university's policies on communication with applicants and recruits could also play a role. If the coach was following standard procedures but made an error, the responsibility might lie more with the university's process than the coach personally. Also, the swimmers' defense of the coach might be due to loyalty to their team and coach, which could be considered bias.\n\nThe author's intent was to inform the public and prevent others from facing the same issue. However, the method of doing so by leaking emails could be problematic. There's a balance between accountability and privacy. If the author had first tried to address the issue privately with the university or through proper channels, that might be more appropriate. Public shaming or exposing private communications could escalate the situation and potentially harm the coach's reputation unfairly if there were mitigating circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, the impact on the sister's mental health and the family's trust in the admissions process is significant. The coach's apology mentioned that they were emailing both applicants and accepted students, leading to the mistake. If this was a systemic issue, the university might need to address their communication protocols. The author's public exposure might be a form of seeking justice or accountability that the family feels they didn't receive from the university.\n\nIn terms of legal implications, sharing private emails could lead to issues like invasion of privacy or defamation if the context is taken out of proportion. However, if the emails are genuine and shared in good faith to inform the public about a mistake, it might be considered protected speech under the First Amendment in the US, depending on the specifics.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions have both justified and questionable aspects. The emotional harm caused by the coach's mistake is real, and the author's intent to prevent future harm is valid. However, the method of publicizing the emails without first exhausting other avenues (like formal complaints or university channels) could be seen as crossing a line. There's a need to weigh the public's right to know against the privacy of the individuals involved.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance between accountability and privacy. If the primary goal was to inform and prevent future mistakes, it's understandable. But if the intent was to humiliate or retaliate, it might be wrong. Since the scenario shows the author's intent is to prevent harm, but the method is controversial, the answer might hinge on cultural norms and the specific circumstances of the university's policies.\n"
