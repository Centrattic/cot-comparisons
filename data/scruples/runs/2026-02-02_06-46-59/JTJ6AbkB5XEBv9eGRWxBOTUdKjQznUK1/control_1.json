I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister was led to believe she was accepted into a university based on an email from the head swimming coach. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, sending an email meant for accepted students to someone who actually wasn't accepted. The author then posted the email thread publicly to highlight the issue and advocate for other students.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. The coach accidentally sent an email to the sister that was intended for accepted students. That's a clear error, and it caused emotional distress to the sister. The coach apologized, but the damage was done. The sister was excited and then devastated when the truth came out. The family is upset, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the author's action is to publicize the email thread on social media. The key question is whether this action is justified or if it's an overstep. Publicizing private emails can be a privacy issue, especially if they weren't meant for public consumption. But in this case, the emails were about a mistake that caused harm to their family. The author argues that they're doing this to raise awareness and prevent others from going through the same issue.\n\nOn one hand, exposing a mistake that affected their family might be seen as a form of accountability and a way to highlight systemic issues in college admissions. On the other hand, sharing private communications could be seen as violating the privacy of the individuals involved, even if the coach made a mistake. The coach might have personal reasons for not wanting that email to be public, even if they were at fault.\n\nAlso, there are other students mentioned who are defending the coach and opposing the publicization. They might be affected by the exposure, such as current students or the coach's reputation, which complicates the situation. The author's intent is to support their sister and prevent others from being in the same situation, but the method involves potentially harming someone else's reputation or privacy.\n\nLegal considerations: In some places, sharing someone's private emails without consent could be a breach of privacy. However, if the emails are relevant to a public issue (like college admissions practices), there might be arguments for public interest. But I'm not sure about the exact legal standing here, and maybe the question is more about moral responsibility than legality.\n\nEthically, it's a balance between the right to privacy and the public's right to know. The author is trying to advocate for their sister and others, but they're using a method that could be seen as shaming the coach publicly. The coach did make a mistake, but the author's action could lead to consequences beyond just the admission process, maybe affecting the coach's job or reputation more than necessary.\n\nAnother angle: The author might not have exhausted other options first, like contacting the university's administration to address the issue formally. If they did that and the university didn't act, then publicizing it could be justified. But if they didn't give the university a chance to fix the problem, maybe that's where the oversight is.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are understandable, but the method of publicizing the emails might be crossing a line by violating privacy. However, given the emotional impact on their sister and the need to raise awareness, there's a counterargument for the necessity of the action. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if the situation is unfortunate.\n"
