I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who publicized their sister's email exchange with the coach is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted to the university, which turned out to be a mistake. The family was really affected, and the sister was devastated. The author took screenshots of the email thread and posted them on social media to highlight the university's mistake and to prevent others from going through the same thing. However, some people, including current students, argue that this was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The coach made an error, which is unfortunate and caused distress. The family's frustration is understandable. But when the author publicizes the emails, that's where the question of right or wrong comes in. \n\nPublicizing private correspondence without consent can be a breach of privacy, even if the intent is to expose a mistake. The emails between the coach and the sister are private communications. Even if the coach made an error, releasing those emails without permission might violate the privacy of both the sister and the coach. The author's intention is to bring awareness and prevent similar issues, but the method involves exposing personal information. \n\nThere's also the aspect of potential repercussions for the coach and the university. If the emails were used to damage the coach's reputation or the university's, it could be seen as vigilantism. The university might have internal processes to handle such mistakes, and bypassing those by going public could be problematic. On the other hand, if the university isn't held accountable, the author might feel justified in taking matters into their own hands. \n\nHowever, the sister's experience is traumatic, and sharing the emails could be seen as a form of seeking justice or support. But the key question is whether the author had the right to do so. The sister's privacy is important, and even though the content is about a mistake, sharing it publicly without consent might be an overstep. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the coach. If the coach made a genuine mistake, public shaming through social media could be excessive. The coach apologized, but the author's action might prevent the coach from learning from the error and moving forward. \n\nIn terms of the law, sharing someone's private emails without their consent could be illegal, depending on the jurisdiction. But the user is asking from a moral standpoint. Ethically, the author's actions might be seen as justified if the intent is to prevent future harm, but the method of using public exposure without consent might still be considered wrong. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the distress caused to the sister is real, but the public sharing of private emails might infringe on others' privacy and rights. The author's intent was to highlight a serious issue in the admissions process, which is a valid concern in the current educational landscape. However, the means of doing so involved releasing private information, which could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they violated privacy, even with good intentions. However, there's a counterargument that the exposure served a greater good. But generally, publicizing private communications without consent is considered ethically wrong, hence Answer A.\n"
