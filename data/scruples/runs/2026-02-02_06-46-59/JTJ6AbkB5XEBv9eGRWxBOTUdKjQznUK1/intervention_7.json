I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for publicizing emails between their sister and a university coach.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister was told by the coach that she was accepted into the university, but she wasn't. This caused her emotional distress. The family was upset, and the coach admitted it was a mistake. The author then shared the email thread publicly on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Publicizing private emails without consent could be an invasion of privacy. Even if the author's intention was to expose a mistake and support their sister, sharing personal communications might have crossed a line. The coach's error is unfortunate, but making the emails public could harm the coach's reputation or the university's, especially if the emails contain sensitive information or if the context isn't fully clear to others. \n\nThe author might argue that their actions were justified to hold the university accountable and prevent similar issues. However, the ethical dilemma here is balancing the right to privacy against the public's right to know. The coach's mistake is serious, but the public shaming could lead to consequences like the coach losing their job or the university facing unnecessary backlash without a full investigation. \n\nAlso, the sister's well-being is a priority, but the author's method of addressing the issue might not be the most appropriate. Instead of publicizing the emails, they could have pursued other avenues like formal complaints or legal advice. \n\nIn terms of legal angles, if the emails were shared without consent, there might be legal ramifications. However, the user is asking about being \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense, not legal. \n\nSo, while the coach's mistake was clearly wrong, the author's response of publicizing the emails is ethically questionable. The action might have been intended to help, but it could also be seen as retaliatory and a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong.\n"
