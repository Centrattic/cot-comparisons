I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for publicizing their sister's email exchange with the head swimming coach. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake, leading to her being rejected later. The author shared the emails publicly on social media to raise awareness and show their disappointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the family's frustration is understandable. The sister went through emotional distress due to the coach's error. The author's intent was to highlight the issue and prevent similar situations for others. Publicizing the emails might serve as a warning and hold the university accountable.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could be seen as violating privacy. The coach might have had a genuine mistake, and public exposure could harm their reputation unjustly. The university might have procedures to address such errors, and airing it publicly could complicate resolving the issue. Also, other students or staff might be unfairly judged based on this incident.\n\nThere's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's actions might be seen as a form of seeking justice or as an overreaction. Depending on the context, if the emails were shared for malicious reasons, it's wrong. But if it's to raise awareness and prevent future issues, some might argue it's justified. However, using private communications without permission generally crosses a line, regardless of intent. The sister's experience is traumatic, but the method of addressing it by going public might not be the most appropriate. The correct approach would be to address the issue through proper channels first before going public. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the coach's privacy and potentially causing further harm without due process.\n"
