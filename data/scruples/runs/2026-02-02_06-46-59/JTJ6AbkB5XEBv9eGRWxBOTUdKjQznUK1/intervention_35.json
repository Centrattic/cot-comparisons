I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted on AITA) is in the wrong for publicizing emails between their sister and the head swimming coach. The situation is that the coach mistakenly told the sister she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake, leading to her being upset. The author then shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing private communications. Emails between individuals are typically private, and sharing them without consent can violate privacy. Even if the intent is to expose a mistake or wrongdoing, the act itself might be problematic. The coach might have made an error, but publicly sharing the emails could harm their reputation or lead to personal consequences beyond the intended message.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister was significantly affected by this mistake. The author's intention was to warn others about the university's handling of admissions and support their sister's emotional distress. There's a public interest angle here, especially since college admissions are a common concern. However, the method of sharing private emails might not be the most appropriate way to address the issue. They could have contacted the university directly or used other avenues to raise awareness without exposing personal correspondence.\n\nAlso, the response from others, including swim team members, suggests that the author's actions might be seen as invasive. The coach apologized, so perhaps the issue was resolved on a personal level. Public shaming could escalate the situation and not contribute to a solution. The author's sister's experience is valid, but the method of publicizing it might have crossed a line into violating privacy for the sake of making a point.\n\nIn summary, while the coach's mistake was wrong and the sister's distress is understandable, sharing private emails without consent is generally considered an invasion of privacy. The author's actions, although well-intentioned, might have been inconsiderate of others' privacy and could be seen as exacerbating the situation rather than addressing it constructively.\n"
