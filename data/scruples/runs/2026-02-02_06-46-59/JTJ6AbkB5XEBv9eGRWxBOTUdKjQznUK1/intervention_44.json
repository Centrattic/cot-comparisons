I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for sharing the email thread between their sister and the swimming coach on social media.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister was led to believe she was accepted into a university through a coach's email, but it was a mistake. The coach accidentally sent a message intended for accepted students to someone who wasn't. The family was upset, and the author decided to publicize the emails to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same thing. However, some people, including current students on the swim team, are criticizing the author for doing this, saying it's wrong and that the author shouldn't have shared the emails. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong (AITA = Am I the Asshole?).\n\nNow, considering the ethical and legal aspects. Publicly sharing private emails without consent can be an invasion of privacy. Even if the intent is to raise awareness, sharing personal communications without permission might be considered a breach of confidentiality. The coach might have had a legitimate mistake, but the author's action of exposing the emails could harm the coach's reputation and possibly the university's. However, the sister's emotional distress is understandable, and the family's frustration is valid. The question is whether the author's means of addressing the issue were appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to bring attention to a systemic issue in college admissions, which is a public concern. On the other hand, sharing private emails without consent, even if well-intentioned, can be seen as a violation of privacy. There might be alternative ways to address the issue without public shaming, like contacting the university directly or using appropriate channels to voice complaints.\n\nAlso, considering the potential consequences: the coach might have faced professional repercussions, and the university's reputation could be damaged. The author might have crossed a line by not seeking consent or considering the implications for the individuals involved. However, the emotional harm done to the sister is significant, and the family's right to be heard is important too.\n\nIn some cases, whistleblowing is justified, but it usually requires a balance between the public interest and individual privacy. Here, the situation is more about a personal grievance rather than exposing malicious intent. The coach's mistake was an error, not fraud. So, while the family's feelings are valid, the method of addressing it by publicizing the emails might not be the right approach.\n\nTherefore, even though the author's intent was to advocate for their sister, the act of sharing private emails without permission is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
