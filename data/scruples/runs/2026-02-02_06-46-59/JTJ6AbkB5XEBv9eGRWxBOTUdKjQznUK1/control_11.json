I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for publicizing their sister's email exchange with the head swimming coach. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister was told by the coach she was accepted into the university, which wasn't true. The coach later admitted it was a mistake, sending the wrong email. The family was really upset, and the author shared the emails publicly to highlight the issue.\n\nNow, the key points here are about whether the author did something wrong by posting the emails. The coach's mistake caused emotional harm to the sister, and the author wanted to raise awareness. But others, especially current students, think the author shouldn't have made it public.\n\nI should consider the ethics here. Was there any violation of privacy? The emails were between the sister and the coach, so putting them online without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the author's intention was to expose the coach's mistake, sharing private communications without permission can be problematic. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of accountability. The coach made a serious error that affected a student's mental health. The author might argue that publicizing it was necessary to prevent others from being in the same situation. However, the appropriate course of action might have been to report it through proper channels rather than public exposure.\n\nAlso, the coach apologized, which might suggest they weren't intentionally malicious. The author's public shaming could have consequences for the coach's job, even if it was a mistake. There's a balance between holding institutions accountable and respecting privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's emotional distress is significant. The author might feel that the public response from the university and coach was insufficient, so they took matters into their own hands. But is it justifiable to share private emails? It's a gray area. \n\nI need to weigh the privacy breach against the public good. If the author's actions prevent future mistakes, maybe it's justified. However, there's a risk of misinformation or taking the emails out of context. The author might have valid reasons, but the method could be questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because sharing private emails without consent invades privacy, even with good intentions. However, there's also an argument for accountability. But legally and ethically, publicizing private communications without permission is generally not acceptable. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
