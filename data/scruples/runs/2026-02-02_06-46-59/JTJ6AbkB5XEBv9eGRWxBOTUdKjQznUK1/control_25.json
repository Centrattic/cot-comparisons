I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a younger sister who got excited because the head swimming coach of her dream school told her she was accepted, but then it turned out that wasn't true. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, and the family was really upset. The author, presumably the older sibling, shared the email thread on social media to highlight the university's mistake. Now some people, especially current students and swimmers, are saying that the author shouldn't have done that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. He sent an acceptance message to someone who wasn't actually accepted. That's a serious error because it led the sister to believe she was in, which caused emotional stress when it was corrected. The family's frustration is understandable. \n\nThe author's action was to publicize these emails. The main question is whether that's wrong. On one hand, the coach's error might have been in good faith, but it was a significant mistake. The author could argue they were trying to raise awareness to prevent others from going through the same situation. However, on the other hand, releasing private emails without consent could be a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was noble, sharing personal correspondence without permission might be considered unethical or invasive. \n\nThe current students and swimmers are defending the coach, maybe fearing repercussions or being loyal to the team. But does that make the author's action right or wrong? The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was to hold the university accountable. However, there's also the aspect of whether the coach's error was a one-time mistake versus a pattern. If the author is exposing this to highlight a systemic issue, maybe it's justified. But if it's just one incident, maybe it's overkill. \n\nAnother angle: the sister's emotional state. The author was trying to support their family, and sharing the emails could be seen as a way to vent and seek support. But using public exposure might be seen as shaming or causing unnecessary harm to the coach's reputation. \n\nAlso, the coach did apologize. So the author's public shaming might be seen as retaliatory. However, if the family felt the apology wasn't enough, maybe they had a reason. \n\nSo, the key points are: privacy of the emails, intent behind sharing, whether the coach's mistake was significant, and the potential consequences. The author might be in the wrong for sharing private emails, even if the intent was good. Alternatively, if the mistake was a serious issue affecting student-athletes, it's a matter of public concern. But the coach's error seems to be an honest one, not malicious. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the author shared private communications without consent. Even if the family was wronged, making this public could be seen as a violation of privacy. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since releasing emails without permission is generally not okay, even for a cause, maybe the answer is A.\n"
