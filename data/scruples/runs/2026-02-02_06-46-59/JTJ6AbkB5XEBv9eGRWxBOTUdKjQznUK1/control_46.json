I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about their sister's situation is in the wrong for publicizing the emails. So first, I need to break down the scenario.\n\nThe sister was a competitive swimmer applying to her dream school. The head coach emailed her, saying she was accepted and that the team wanted her. They thought it was official until later when the actual acceptance never came. Then the coach admitted it was a mistake\u2014emailing her along with those who were actually accepted. The family is upset, and the author put the email thread on social media to show their disappointment and warn others. But some people, including current swimmers, are saying the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo the key points here are: the coach made an error, the family was misled and emotionally hurt, and the author shared the emails publicly. Now, the question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider ethical aspects. Publicizing private emails could be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent is to expose wrongdoing. The coach might have a case against the university, but the emails might contain sensitive information. Also, the author's intention was to seek accountability and prevent others from going through the same issue. However, sharing such information could harm the coach's reputation or the university, even if it's a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were a response to a significant emotional and professional setback for their sister. They argue that the public needs to know about this issue in the admissions process. But maybe there were other ways to address it, like reporting it to the university or a higher authority instead of public shaming.\n\nAlso, the current swimmers defending the coach might be biased, but the coach is part of the university's administration. The author might have a valid point about the system's flaws, but the method of exposing it is questionable. So, while the situation is unfortunate, the act of publicizing private communications without consent could be seen as wrong, even with good intentions. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the privacy violation, even if the cause is understandable.\n"
