I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for publicizing the email thread between their sister and the head swimming coach. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister got an email from the coach saying she was accepted to the university and the team. The family was excited, and she was happy when the official letter came, but then it turned out she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake, emailing her along with others who had been accepted. The family is upset, and the sister is in tears. The author then shared the email thread publicly on social media to highlight the issue and prevent others from going through the same thing. But some people, especially students from the university's swim team, are criticizing the author for doing this.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author wrong for sharing these emails? Let's think about the possible angles. On one hand, the coach made a mistake that caused emotional harm to the sister. The author's intention was to raise awareness and prevent others from being misled, which could be seen as a legitimate concern. Publicizing the emails might serve as a warning to other students and institutions to be more careful.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without the consent of all parties involved could be a privacy issue. The coach might have personal or professional repercussions, even if the mistake was unintentional. Also, the swimmers who responded negatively might feel that their reputation or the coach's integrity is being attacked, even if they were not directly involved in the mistake. The author's action could be seen as public shaming, which can sometimes cross ethical lines, even if the intent was good.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's well-being. The author might have thought that by going public, they could hold the university accountable and maybe even help their sister in some way, like getting a second chance or an apology. However, airing this publicly could also be stressful for the sister if she didn't consent to it. It's important to consider if the sister agreed for her personal situation to be shared online.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the coach addressed the mistake. The coach apologized and explained the error. Publicizing the emails might not be necessary if the family already received an explanation. The author might have felt that the university wasn't handling it adequately, but bypassing formal channels and going to social media could be seen as escalatory.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. While the coach's mistake was harmful, the author's method of exposing it might not be the most appropriate. Maybe the family could have worked with the university to resolve the issue privately, while still ensuring that the coach takes responsibility. Public shaming can sometimes lead to defensiveness rather than constructive solutions.\n\nAdditionally, the swimmers who are on the team might be concerned about the reputation of their coach affecting their own recruitment or team dynamics. They might not see the author's perspective because they haven't experienced the same situation. However, their criticism about the public nature of the emails could be valid if it harms the coach unfairly.\n\nIn summary, while the intent to raise awareness is understandable, the method of publicizing private emails without consent might lead to ethical and privacy concerns. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the potential consequences for all parties involved, especially the coach and possibly the sister's privacy. However, if the sister consented and the emails were shared to seek accountability, it's a bit more nuanced. But given the information, it's likely the author is in the wrong for publicizing the emails without the consent of all involved.\n"
