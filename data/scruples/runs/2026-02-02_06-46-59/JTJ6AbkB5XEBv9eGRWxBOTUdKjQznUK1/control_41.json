I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for publishing the email thread between their sister and the swim coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the coach that she was accepted into the university and the team, which made the family and her excited. But then it turned out she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted it was a mistake\u2014he was emailing people who had applied and those who were accepted, and mixed up the emails. The family is upset, and the person posted the emails publicly to show how the university messed up, to warn others.\n\nNow, the question is whether posting those emails is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the coach made a mistake and apologized. The family was wronged, and the sister suffered emotional distress. The person might feel justified in exposing the issue to hold the university accountable and prevent others from going through the same thing. They might argue that publicizing the emails is a form of whistleblowing to highlight a systemic issue in college admissions.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails could be a breach of privacy. The coach might have intended his email to be a private communication, and releasing it without consent could be seen as violating confidentiality. Even if the intentions are good, there might be ethical or legal implications. The coach might argue that the mistake was acknowledged and apologized for, and publicizing it could harm his reputation beyond what's necessary. Also, the people on social media who are students might feel that the author is unfairly targeting the coach, especially if he's already apologized.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the action. The author's motivation is to raise awareness and prevent similar issues. But is that a valid reason to publish private correspondence? There's a balance between accountability and privacy. Maybe there were other ways to address the issue, like reporting the mistake to the university administration or contacting the media through proper channels instead of sharing screenshots on social media.\n\nAlso, the response from others\u2014students on the swim team\u2014suggests that the author's action might be seen as public shaming. Even if the coach was at fault, the author's method of addressing it could be seen as disproportionate. The coach did take responsibility, so maybe the author's action is more about venting frustration than seeking a constructive solution.\n\nLegally, sharing someone's private emails without consent could be problematic. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws against publishing private communications. Even if it's not illegal, it's ethically questionable if the emails contain confidential information.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in this case, the emails were part of a process that directly affected the student's future, and the public has a right to know about such mistakes in the admissions process, especially in the context of college athletics where there's a lot of scrutiny.\n\nBut the coach's apology mentions that it was an inadvertent error, so maybe the university is handling it internally. The author's public exposure might be adding public pressure where it's not needed, potentially causing more harm than good.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is trying to protect their sister and prevent others from being harmed, but the method might cross a line. There's a difference between advocating for change and airing grievances in a public forum without considering the other party's perspective.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the author's action might be seen as understandable given the emotional impact on their sister, but the method of addressing it by publishing private emails could be considered wrong. The coach's mistake was acknowledged, and the family's distress is valid, but exposing the emails might not be the right approach. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the breach of privacy and potential for public shaming, even with good intentions.\n"
