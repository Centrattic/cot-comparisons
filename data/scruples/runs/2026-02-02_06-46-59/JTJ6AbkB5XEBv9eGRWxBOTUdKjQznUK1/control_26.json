I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for posting the emails between their sister and the coach. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister got an email from the coach saying she was accepted, but it was a mistake. She wasn't actually accepted, which caused a lot of emotional distress. The author then publicized the email thread on social media to highlight the university's mistake and prevent others from going through the same thing. Some people, especially current students on the team, are upset about this public exposure.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are: Is the author allowed to share private emails? Did the coach make an error, and does sharing that email serve a legitimate purpose? Also, what are the potential consequences of publicizing this?\n\nThe coach's email was a mistake, and the family is understandably upset. The author's intention was to raise awareness to prevent similar issues for others. However, by sharing private correspondence without consent, the author might be violating privacy. Even if the motive is good, there might be ethical and legal considerations here. \n\nBut then again, there's a public interest angle. The college admissions process is under scrutiny, and exposing flaws could be in the public's interest. However, the author should have considered other avenues first, like contacting the school directly or using official channels to address the issue. Public shaming through social media might not be the best approach, even if the intention is noble.\n\nAlso, the current students are upset because they might be affected by the negative publicity. The coach's mistake is one thing, but airing it publicly could harm reputations beyond just the coach. The author's action might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's frustration is valid. They were led to believe their daughter was accepted, leading to emotional harm. The coach's apology seems to acknowledge the mistake, but maybe not adequately address the impact on the student. The author's public action could be a form of seeking justice or accountability.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action of sharing private emails without consent is justified. In many cases, sharing private communications without permission can be considered a breach of privacy, even if done with good intentions. The author might have a point in wanting to bring attention to the issue, but the method used could be problematic. There's a balance between exposing wrongdoing and respecting privacy.\n\nAnother angle: The coach's error might be a systemic issue in the admissions process. The author's public post could serve as a warning to others. However, the appropriate way to handle this might be through official complaints or media channels rather than directly posting private emails.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect their sister and prevent others from similar experiences, but the method of using public shaming and sharing private emails could be seen as wrong. It's a gray area where the intent is good but the execution might be questionable.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, which can be considered an invasion of privacy, regardless of the intention. Alternatively, if the public interest justifies it, maybe B (not in the wrong). But generally, sharing private emails without permission is ethically iffy.\n"
