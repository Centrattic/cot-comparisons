I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author's younger sister got an email from the head swimming coach at her dream school, congratulating her on being accepted. The family got excited, and the sister was especially happy. But then, it turned out she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted he made a mistake and sent the wrong email to people who had applied but weren't accepted. The author then took screenshots of the email thread and posted them publicly on social media to highlight the university's mistake and show how unfair this was to their sister. Now, some people are saying the author is wrong to do that, especially students on the swim team, who are biased towards the coach.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for publicizing the emails. Let me consider the possible angles. On one hand, the coach made a serious mistake that caused emotional distress to the student. The author's intention was to raise awareness and prevent this from happening to others. Publishing the emails could serve as a warning to other students and hold the university accountable. On the other hand, by sharing private correspondence, the author might have invaded the coach's privacy or could have caused reputational harm beyond what's justified. There's also the aspect of whether the coach's mistake was an honest error versus intentional deception. The coach apologized and took responsibility, so maybe the author's public shaming is unnecessary. \n\nI should also think about the impact on the sister. She went through a lot of emotional turmoil, and the author wanted to support her by making the issue public. However, exposing the emails could have unintended consequences, like affecting the coach's career or the university's reputation in a way that doesn't directly help the sister. The other students on the swim team might feel that the author's actions unfairly target the coach without understanding the full context. \n\nAnother point is whether the author had other avenues to address the issue. Maybe they could have contacted the university's administration or media outlets instead of social media. But the author's main goal was to highlight the problem, and social media is a common platform for such issues. However, public shaming can sometimes be seen as a form of vigilantism. It's a balance between holding institutions accountable and respecting boundaries.\n\nAlso, considering the coach's response: he admitted fault, apologized, and explained that it was a mistake. The university might have processes in place to handle such errors, and the author's public exposure might hinder those processes or create a hostile environment. The question is whether the author's action was a reasonable response given the emotional distress caused to their sister.\n"
