I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted about their sister's situation is in the wrong for publicizing the email exchange.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was told by the swim coach that she was accepted into the university and the team. The family got excited, but then found out it was a mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email. The author then posted the screenshots on social media to highlight the issue and support their sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to share the emails? Was there any harm done by sharing? What about privacy? The coach made a mistake, but the author's action might have exposed the coach's error publicly. Also, the response from some students at the university who are on the swim team suggest that the author's action might not be appropriate, possibly because it could affect the coach's reputation or the team's standing.\n\nOn one hand, the family is upset and wanted to raise awareness about the college admissions process and prevent others from going through the same thing. Publicizing the emails could be seen as a way to hold the university accountable and support their sister's emotional distress.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing emails without permission could be a breach of privacy. The coach might have had a genuine mistake, even if it caused harm. The author shared the emails publicly, which could lead to reputational damage for the coach and possibly the university. Even though the coach admitted fault, the public exposure might be excessive. Additionally, the students on the team might be unfairly affected if the public backlash is directed at them, even if they weren't involved in the mistake.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action was justified. If the coach's mistake is a matter of public concern, especially in the context of college admissions scandals, then maybe sharing it is okay. However, if the emails were private and the author didn't have consent to share them, that's a problem. Also, the author's intent is important. They wanted to highlight the sister's pain and the university's failure, but could there have been another way to address this without publicizing the emails?\n\nI think the author's intention is understandable, but the method might be questionable. Publicly sharing private correspondence without consent, even if the intent is to advocate for their sister, could be seen as crossing a line. The coach's mistake was acknowledged, but the author's action might have caused further harm by exposing the coach's error publicly. The students on the team might not be at fault, but their responses indicate that they feel the author's action is unfair. \n\nIn terms of ethics, privacy is a big factor. Even if the university made a mistake, releasing private emails could be considered a violation of confidentiality. There's a balance between holding institutions accountable and respecting individual privacy. The author might have other avenues to seek resolution, like contacting the university's administration directly or using legal recourse if necessary, rather than public exposure.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for publicizing the emails without permission, even though their intentions were to support their sister and bring attention to the issue. The act of sharing the emails publicly could have legal and ethical implications, regardless of the good intentions.\n"
