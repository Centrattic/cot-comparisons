I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question (the author) is in the wrong for publicly sharing the email exchange between their sister and the swimming coach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister applied to a university, and the coach mistakenly informed her she was accepted when she wasn't. This caused a lot of emotional distress. The author then posted the emails on social media to highlight the issue and warn others. Some people, including students at the university, are upset that the author did this, saying it's wrong.\n\nNow, the key points: The coach made a mistake by sending the wrong email. The author's sister was misled and upset. The author's action was to publicize the emails to make the issue known. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were trying to hold the university accountable and prevent others from going through the same situation. They could claim it's a matter of public interest, especially given the stress of college admissions.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing private emails without consent could be a violation of privacy. Even if the coach made a mistake, the emails might be confidential. By posting them publicly, the author could be exposing private communications, which might have repercussions. Additionally, the swimmers and others at the university might feel misrepresented or embarrassed by the public disclosure, even if they weren't at fault.\n\nAlso, the coach's explanation is that he confused emails between applicants and accepted students. That's a mistake, but does the public need to see the emails to understand the issue? Maybe there's a way to address this without sharing the private messages. The author's intent was to protect others, but the method might cross ethical lines.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's sister was wronged, but the author's response could be seen as overstepping. The public shaming or exposure might not be the right approach, even if the coach was at fault. There could be legal issues if the emails were private, and sharing them might be a breach of privacy.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without the permission of the parties involved, even if their intentions were good. The right course of action might have been to address the issue privately with the university and perhaps through appropriate channels rather than publishing the emails publicly.\n"
