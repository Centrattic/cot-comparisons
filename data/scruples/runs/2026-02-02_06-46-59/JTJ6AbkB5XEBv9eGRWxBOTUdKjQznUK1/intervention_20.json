I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the older sibling) is at fault for posting the email exchange between their sister and the coach publicly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister got a fake acceptance email from the coach, which turned out to be a mistake. The coach admitted to sending the wrong email, confusing Early Action applicants with those who were actually accepted. The family was upset, and the author posted the emails on social media to highlight the issue and warn others. Some people, especially students from the university's swim team, are upset with the author for going public.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was sharing the emails ethical? The coach made a mistake, but does that justify public shaming? The author's intent was to inform others and hold the university accountable. However, the emails might contain personal information or sensitive details. Also, publicizing it could affect the coach's reputation without due process, even if the mistake was genuine. The family's frustration is understandable, but is there a better way to address it, like reporting to the university administration instead of social media?\n\nPrivacy is a big factor. The emails are between the sister and the coach. By sharing them publicly, the author might be violating privacy. Even if the sister agreed, maybe she wasn't aware of the full consequences. Also, the coach's apology shows he took responsibility. The author's action could be seen as punitive without allowing the university to handle it internally. \n\nOn the other hand, the coach's error caused significant emotional distress. The author's intention is to prevent others from going through the same. But public shaming can be counterproductive and might not lead to institutional change. There's a line between advocacy and privacy violation. \n\nSo, considering these aspects, the author might be in the wrong for sharing private communications without consent, even if the motive is noble. The appropriate action might have been to contact the university's administrators or use official channels to address the issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
