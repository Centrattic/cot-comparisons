I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister got a fake email from the coach saying she was accepted, which turned out to be a mistake. The author then publicized the email thread on social media to highlight the university's mistake and to seek support for their sister's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the coach's mistake. He sent an email to applicants, including the sister, thinking they were accepted but they weren't. That's a clear error on his part. The coach apologized, explaining that he was emailing both recent applicants and accepted students, and messed up. So the university's fault is clear here.\n\nNow, the author's action was to take screenshots of the email thread and post them publicly. The question is whether that's wrong. The author's intention was to raise awareness about the university's error, to make sure others know this happened so no other student-athlete goes through this. But others, like the students on the swim team, are saying it's not right for the author to do that, maybe because they feel it's invading the coach's privacy or could harm his reputation.\n\nOn one hand, the author's motivation was to support their sister and prevent future mistakes. The situation led to significant emotional distress for the sister, which is valid. Publicizing the emails could serve as a warning to others and hold the university accountable. However, on the other hand, releasing private emails without consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the coach made a mistake, the emails are personal communications. \n\nBut here, the coach's mistake might have contributed to the problem. If the emails were part of the misunderstanding, then sharing them might be justified as part of holding the university accountable. However, there's a line between accountability and public shaming. The author's action could affect the coach's career, which might be a harsh consequence if the intention was just to warn others. \n\nAlso, the family's right to express their frustration is understandable. The coach's apology doesn't erase the harm done to the sister. Publicizing the emails could be a form of seeking justice for the sister. But is there a more appropriate way to address this, like through the university's administration or legal channels?\n\nThe key points here are the intent, the context of the mistake, and the consequences of publicizing the emails. If the author's goal was to prevent future incidents and the university is at fault, then maybe it's justified. But if the author is using public shaming as a means of retaliation, that could be problematic. However, given the emotional impact on the sister and the coach's admission of error, it's a gray area. \n\nIn similar cases, people might argue that transparency is important, especially in institutions that handle sensitive information. The university might not take responsibility if the issue is kept private, so publicizing could force them to address it. However, releasing private correspondence could be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent is good. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the coach's mistake was significant and caused real harm. Publicizing the emails serves as a necessary disclosure to prevent others from suffering the same issue. The coach's error was a professional mistake, and the author's action is a form of accountability. However, there's a balance needed. Maybe the author could have first tried to work with the university before going public. But given that the coach and university didn't seem to take the issue seriously (as the coach's response was an apology but perhaps no concrete action), publicizing might be the only way to get attention. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the coach's responsibility for the mistake and the harm caused, the author's action is more about seeking justice and accountability, so they are not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
