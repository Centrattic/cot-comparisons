I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who posted the emails (the author) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the sister was told by the coach she was accepted into the university, which made her and her family overjoyed. Later, it turned out it was a mistake. The coach admitted he sent the wrong email. The author then posted the email thread publicly on social media to show their disappointment and to warn others. Some people, including current students on the team, say that the author is wrong to do this, possibly to protect the coach's reputation or their own experiences.\n\nSo, the key points here are the reasons for publicizing the emails. The author's intent was to highlight the university's mistake and prevent others from experiencing the same issue. However, the coach apologized, explaining it was an error in sending emails to both applicants and accepted students.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by sharing the emails. On one hand, sharing private communication without consent can be a breach of privacy. The coach might have had a good reason to reach out to applicants early, but the mistake happened. The author's action could be seen as exposing the coach and university, which might be justified to raise awareness. On the other hand, publicizing private emails could have negative consequences for the coach, even if it was a mistake, and might not be the best way to address the issue. The sister's emotional distress is valid, but using public shaming could be seen as harmful.\n\nI need to consider if there were other avenues to resolve this before going public. The mother did contact the coach, and the coach apologized. The author might feel the issue wasn't adequately addressed, hence the social media post. However, the coach's mistake, while painful, was an error, not an intentional deception. Publicly sharing the emails could damage reputations unnecessarily. The response from the university and whether they took corrective action isn't mentioned here. If they didn't, maybe the author had a reason to speak out. But without more context, it's hard to say if the public exposure was justified.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author had a valid grievance but chose a public platform. Some might argue that this is a legitimate way to hold institutions accountable, especially given the stress on college admissions. Others might say it's an invasion of privacy and that the coach's personal mistake shouldn't be publicly scrutinized unless there's a pattern of misconduct.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's intent was to prevent future issues, but the method of using public exposure might be seen as excessive or unfair. The coach's response was an apology, so the author's action could be seen as escalating the situation beyond what's necessary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not giving the university a chance to address the issue internally before going public.\n"
