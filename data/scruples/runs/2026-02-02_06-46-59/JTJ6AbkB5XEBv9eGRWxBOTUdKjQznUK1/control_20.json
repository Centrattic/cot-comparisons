I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story on social media is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister received a fake acceptance email from the coach, which led to her being devastated when she actually wasn't admitted. The author of the post, which is the older sibling, shared the email thread publicly to highlight the university's mistake and the impact it had on their sister.\n\nSo, first, the coach made a mistake by sending an email to a student who wasn't actually accepted. That's definitely on the coach. The coach later admitted to sending the wrong email, which is a big error. The sister was emotionally affected, which is understandable. The author's action was to publicize the emails to raise awareness and prevent others from going through the same thing. But some people, including current students and the swim team, are criticizing the author for doing this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: 1) Did the author have a right to share the emails publicly? 2) Was the coach's mistake significant enough to warrant public exposure? 3) Are there any ethical or legal implications in sharing private emails?\n\nFirst, the coach's mistake seems to be a genuine error, but it's still a serious one that caused emotional distress. However, sharing private emails without consent can be problematic. The author might be infringing on the privacy of the coach and possibly the sister, even if the intent was to highlight the mistake. There's a line between advocating for one's sister and violating privacy or causing further harm to someone else's reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, the coach might have used the student's personal information to reach out, and the emails are part of a professional communication. The author's intention was to raise awareness about a systemic issue in college admissions. But does that justify public exposure? It's a balance between free speech and privacy rights.\n\nAlso, the fact that some people are defending the coach and the university could be because they feel the author's actions are more damaging than the mistake itself. The swimmers might be protecting their coach, but the author might feel that the sister's experience is more important.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, sharing emails without consent might be a breach of privacy or could be considered harassment. However, if the emails are being used to report a mistake and not to defame, it might fall under free speech, depending on jurisdiction. But ethically, even if it's legal, it's a question of whether it's right to expose someone's mistake publicly, even if they made a genuine error.\n\nThe coach apologized, so the author's public exposure might have been unnecessary. The sister's emotional harm is real, but the author's action could also harm the coach's career or reputation, possibly unfairly. The coach's mistake was a human error, not a malicious act. The author might be seeking justice for their sister, but the method could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nIn summary, while the coach is at fault for the mistake, the sister's emotional distress is valid. However, the author's decision to publicize the emails might be crossing a line into privacy violation and potentially causing more harm than good. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for choosing public exposure over other avenues like contacting the university directly or seeking support through appropriate channels instead of social media.\n"
