I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about their sister's situation is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister receiving a mistakenly sent acceptance email from a coach, which led to false hope, and then the author publicizing the email thread on social media. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The coach admitted to a mistake, sending an email to someone who wasn't actually accepted. The family was upset, especially the sister, who had been putting a lot into her college applications and swimming career. The author then took screenshots of the email conversation and posted them publicly to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. Publicizing private emails can be a sensitive issue. The author's intention was to highlight the coach's mistake and prevent it from happening to others. But the coach had already apologized and acknowledged the error. The family's main grievance is the emotional distress caused by the mistake, but the author's action of sharing the emails could have additional implications.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that the coach's error is a systemic issue in college admissions and that sharing the emails serves the public good by informing others. However, on the other hand, the emails might contain personal information or confidential communications. Even though the coach made a mistake, the author's public disclosure could be seen as violating privacy, especially if the emails weren't intended for public consumption. Also, the fact that current students are defending the coach might suggest that the author's actions could be affecting the coach's reputation or the university's image without giving them a platform to respond in a measured way.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author's intent was to advocate for their sister and prevent similar situations, which is understandable. However, using public shaming or social media might be considered aggressive. There might be other ways to address the issue, like contacting the university administration directly or working with the media through proper channels rather than taking it to social media.\n\nAlso, the coach's explanation was that they were emailing both applicants and accepted students, leading to an error. The university might have policies in place for such miscommunications, and the author's public exposure could be seen as unnecessary escalation. However, the emotional harm done to the sister is significant, and the author's action was to seek accountability.\n\nIn terms of ethics and legality, sharing private communications without consent can be problematic. Unless the emails were part of a public interest case or there's a legal obligation to disclose, the author might be overstepping. However, in this context, it's more about personal accountability and ethical considerations rather than legal ones. \n\nThe key here is balancing the right to privacy with the right to expose wrongdoing. The coach's mistake is indeed a problem, but the method of exposure could be questioned. The author's action might be seen as justified if the issue is systemic and needs public attention, but if it's a personal mistake that doesn't affect the public broadly, then it might be inconsiderate.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. However, typically, in such cases, publicizing private emails without the involved parties' consent can be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent is good. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the privacy of communications, even if the coach was at fault. Alternatively, if the information is relevant and the public has a right to know about systemic issues, it could be justified. But given the context provided, the main issue is the public disclosure of private emails, which is more likely to place the author in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
