I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears. My mother immediately emailed the coach back and told him about this. In response, he said:\n\n&gt; Thank you for your email. After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly. The swimmers in particular will *never* understand what my sister is going through and are clearly biased to the head swim coach. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted about their sister's experience is in the wrong for sharing the emails publicly. So, the situation is that the sister was told by the coach she was accepted into the university, which made her and her family really excited. But then she wasn't actually accepted. The coach admitted he sent the wrong email. Then the family, especially the older sibling, shared the email thread on social media to publicize the mistake and show how bad the university handled it. Some people, including students from the swim team, are saying that the author is wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the different angles here. On one hand, the family went through a lot of emotional distress because of the coach's mistake. The sister was excited and then devastated. The coach apologized, but the family feels that the university needs to be held accountable to prevent this from happening to others. By sharing the emails, they want to raise awareness. \n\nOn the other hand, sharing the emails publicly could be seen as a privacy issue. The coach might not have intended for those emails to be made public. Also, the students on the swim team might be defending the coach because they are part of the same team, but maybe they have a point about the coach's mistake being an error rather than intentional. \n\nThere's also the question of whether the author overstepped by using social media to expose the coach and university. Even if the coach made a mistake, sharing private communications without consent could be a breach of privacy. The coach's emails were probably meant to be confidential between him and the student. \n\nBut then again, the family's intention was to highlight a problem in the admissions process. They might argue that the university's actions (or inactions) caused harm, and by going public, they're protecting other students from similar experiences. However, there might be a more appropriate way to address the issue, like filing a formal complaint or reporting the issue privately.\n\nAnother angle: the coach admitted the mistake. The university might have already taken steps to correct it. Public shaming via social media could be unnecessary and potentially damaging to the coach's reputation if the mistake was indeed an honest error. The family might be seeking justice, but the method could be seen as too harsh.\n\nAlso, the sister's emotional state is a factor. The author might feel the need to advocate for their sister, but the public exposure could be seen as adding insult to injury for the coach or the university if they were trying to handle it privately. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between accountability and privacy. The author's actions could be justified if they believe the university needs to be held accountable, but they also need to consider the privacy of the individuals involved. The response from the other students (especially the swimmers) suggests that some people in the community might feel that the author is being unfair by exposing the coach publicly, perhaps because they see it as a simple mistake rather than malicious intent.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was the mistake intentional? It seems unintentional. Did the author have a right to share the emails? Probably not, since they were private. However, the intent was to expose a problem. The coach did apologize. The university might have procedures to handle such errors. The public sharing might have been an emotional reaction rather than a measured one.\n\nIn conclusion, while the family's frustration is understandable, sharing private emails publicly without consent is likely a breach of privacy, even if the intention was to highlight an issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using that method.\n"
