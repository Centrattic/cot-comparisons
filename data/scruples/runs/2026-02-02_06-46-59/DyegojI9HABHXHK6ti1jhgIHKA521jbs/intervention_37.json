She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote about buying their pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife is 16 weeks pregnant and suffering from hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed most of the day, and only goes to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thinks she's depressed from missing work and wants her to get fresh air and exercise. He bought her a prenatal yoga pass. However, she was upset, saying it was a rude present and he was tone-deaf. Her friends agreed with her, and he's upset she criticized it.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the husband's intention was good, he thought yoga might help her depression and get her out of the house. But her condition is severe, and she might not be able to handle yoga right now. The issue is whether he considered her current state and if the gift was appropriate.\n\nI need to consider if his action was well-meaning but misguided. He might not have realized how bad her symptoms are. If she's too sick to even do yoga, then the gift might not be practical. But he did research and found prenatal yoga, which is suitable for pregnancy. However, if she's bedridden and vomiting frequently, maybe even prenatal yoga is too much for her right now. The key is whether he overstepped by not considering her actual condition despite his good intentions.\n\nAlso, her reaction: she didn't thank him immediately and gave a look. He might interpret it as rudeness, but she feels it's insensitive. Her friends siding with her suggests that maybe he was tone-deaf. Even if the intention was good, the timing and her current state might make the gift inappropriate. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her severe symptoms and how she's feeling, even though he had good intentions.\n\nBut maybe he's not in the wrong because he was trying to help. The question is about right vs. wrong, not about intentions. If he didn't know the extent of her condition, maybe he still acted in the wrong because he didn't communicate with her first. Assuming he didn't consult her before buying the pass, even though he researched, it might have been better to ask if she wanted that. So, the mistake was not checking in with her before getting the gift. Hence, he's in the wrong because he made an assumption about what she needed without considering her current situation.\n"
