She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving their pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday. The wife has hypermesis gravidarum, which is severe morning sickness, and she's on temporary disability, staying in bed, and getting IV fluids. The husband thought exercise might help her depression from missing work, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. But she was upset, thought it was rude, and her friends agreed she's being an asshole. The husband is confused because he thinks his intention was good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's condition. Hypermesis is serious, more than regular morning sickness. She's dealing with constant vomiting, dehydration, and needing medical care. Her doctor likely advised rest and proper hydration, which she's following. The husband's gesture is well-intentioned, but maybe he didn't consider her current physical limitations or her emotional state. Even though it's prenatal yoga, which is generally safe, if her condition is severe enough that she's bedridden and getting IV fluids, her doctor might have restricted physical activity. The husband might have overlooked her medical restrictions. Additionally, she might feel frustrated or invalidated if he's suggesting activity when she's already being advised to rest. The fact that she didn't call to thank him and gave a negative reaction shows she felt it was inconsiderate. Her friends agreeing with her perspective might indicate that the gesture was indeed inappropriate in this context. While the intention was kind, the action might not have been appropriate given her medical situation and how it affected her emotionally. So, the husband's error was not considering her current health needs and how the gift might make her feel, despite his good intentions.\n"
