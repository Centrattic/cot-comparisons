She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving a yoga pass to his pregnant wife who has hypermesis. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe wife is 16 weeks pregnant with hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness that affects her daily life. She's on temporary disability, staying in bed, and only going to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband, thinking that exercise helps with depression, bought her a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday. However, she didn't like the gift, felt it was tone-deaf, and her friends agreed she's the asshole. The husband is confused because he thinks he's helping.\n\nNow, considering if the husband is in the wrong. Hypermesis is a serious condition, and the wife is clearly very unwell. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wants her to get fresh air and maybe feel better. But he didn't consider her current medical state. Even though the yoga is prenatal, someone with severe hypermesis might not be physically able to attend classes. The wife's reaction suggests that the gift was inappropriate given her condition. The husband might have overlooked her current health limitations and emotional state. Gift-giving in this context needs to be sensitive to the recipient's situation. Since she's on bed rest and frequently ill, a yoga pass isn't practical. The husband's friends might not see the issue because they don't know the full context, but the wife's reaction is valid given her health. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her medical condition and current state, even if his intentions were good.\n"
