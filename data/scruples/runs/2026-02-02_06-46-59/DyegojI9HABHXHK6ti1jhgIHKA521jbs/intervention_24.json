She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving a yoga pass to his pregnant wife who has hypermesis. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is 16 weeks pregnant with severe hypermesis, which is worse than regular morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes for IV fluids. The husband thinks she's depressed and wants her to get out and exercise, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. But she was upset, called him tone-deaf, and her friends agreed. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the facts. Hypermesis is a serious condition with constant nausea and vomiting, leading to hospital visits and IVs. The wife is bedridden and can't work. The husband's intention was to help her depression by getting her to move and get fresh air, but maybe he didn't consider her current health state. Prenatal yoga is generally good, but if she's too sick to get out of bed most days, attending classes might be physically impossible or inadvisable. \n\nHe bought the pass without her input. Even if his intentions were good, not discussing the gift with her first might have been a mistake. She might have felt pressured or not consulted on her own needs, especially when she's unwell. Her reaction, though harsh, could stem from feeling ignored during a tough time. The husband might have overlooked the severity of her condition and the fact that she's on medical leave, so expecting her to attend classes might not align with her doctor's recommendations.\n\nAlso, her friends' opinion that he was an asshole suggests that the social context is against him. The wife's friends might see the gift as dismissive of her health issues. The husband's belief that it's not rude could be a misjudgment of the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the intention is good, but the execution might have missed the mark. The key point is whether the husband considered her current medical advice and her personal feelings. If her doctor hasn't recommended yoga, or if it's not feasible given her condition, then the gift was inappropriate. The husband should have communicated better, maybe asked her what she needed or wanted instead of assuming. \n\nSo, the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because despite good intentions, the gift didn't take into account her medical condition and lack of current ability to attend classes, leading to hurt feelings and a perceived lack of consideration for her situation.\n"
