She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for giving a yoga pass to his pregnant wife as a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, the wife is 16 weeks pregnant with hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed most of the day, and goes to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thinks she's depressed from missing work and wants her to get some exercise and fresh air, so he buys a prenatal yoga pass. The wife reacts negatively, thinking it's a rude and tone-deaf gift, and her friends agree. The husband is upset that she's critical of his gift.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's intentions versus the wife's perception. The husband's intention was to help her feel better and encourage activity, which is well-meaning. However, the wife is in a very vulnerable state physically and emotionally. Even though the husband researched prenatal yoga, she might feel that any physical activity is not feasible given her condition. Her reaction could stem from frustration or feeling misunderstood. The husband didn't consult her about her needs, assuming he knew what's best, which might have been a misstep. While his intentions are good, the action didn't consider her current ability or emotional state. The friends' agreement with her suggests that the gift was indeed inappropriate. So, while he's not entirely wrong, the fact that she felt it was rude and his friends back her up might mean he's in the wrong here. The answer is likely A.\n"
