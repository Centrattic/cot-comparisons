She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought a yoga pass for their pregnant wife on her birthday is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She stays in bed most of the time and only goes to the hospital. The husband thinks she might be depressed from missing work and wants her to get some exercise and fresh air, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. But she didn't like it, found it rude, and her friends agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's condition. Hypermesis is serious; it's more than regular morning sickness. It causes her to vomit even at night, need IV fluids, and she's on medical leave. So, she's probably feeling very unwell, both physically and emotionally. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wants to help her by getting her active and maybe alleviate her depression. But the problem is that the gift might not be appropriate given her current health status.\n\nEven though the yoga is prenatal, which is designed for pregnant women, if she's severely ill, the idea of going to a class might be overwhelming. She might feel too weak, nauseous, or embarrassed. The husband didn't consult her directly before getting the gift, assuming she might want it. But in a situation like this, communication is key. She might not feel up to it, and the gift could come off as insensitive because he didn't consider her current state. \n\nThe wife's reaction is important here. She didn't thank him and gave a disapproving look, which the husband noticed. Her friends also think he's being an asshole. That suggests that his gesture, while well-meaning, missed the mark. The issue isn't the gift itself but the lack of consideration for her feelings and health. The husband might have thought he was being supportive, but he didn't take into account her current needs and how she might perceive the gift. \n\nSo, even if the intention was good, the action might be seen as tone-deaf because he didn't consider her perspective. The wife is in a vulnerable state, and suggesting physical activity might not be the best approach. The husband should have discussed it with her first to see if she wanted to try something like that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and health context properly.\n"
