She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting a yoga pass for his pregnant wife with hypermesis. The situation is that the wife is very sick, on temporary disability, and spends most of her time in bed. The husband thinks exercise might help her depression from missing work, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. But she was upset, called him tone-deaf, and her friends agreed she's right.\n\nHmm, so first, hypermesis is severe morning sickness. The wife is really unwell, so maybe doing yoga isn't something she could consider right now. The husband's intention was good, wanting her to get out and feel better, but he didn't consult her first. Even though he researched prenatal yoga, he didn't check if she wanted or could do that. She might feel like he's dismissing her condition, thinking she's not taking her symptoms seriously. The fact that she was critical of the gift and her friends supported her suggests that the gesture was insensitive. The husband might have thought of her best interest, but not considering her current state and feelings could be where he went wrong. So, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her feelings and current health status.\n"
