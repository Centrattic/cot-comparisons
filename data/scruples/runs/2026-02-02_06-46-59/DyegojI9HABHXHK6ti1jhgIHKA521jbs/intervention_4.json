She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving his pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. She's on medical leave, stays in bed, and goes to the hospital for IVs. The author thought exercise might help her depression from missing work and wanted her to get some fresh air. The wife was upset, felt it was a rude gift, and her friends agreed. The author thinks it's not his fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Hypermesis is serious, so her condition is severe. She's already on temporary disability, which implies her doctor has advised her to rest. The author's intention was good\u2014he wants her to feel better through exercise, similar to his own experience. However, her current state might make physical activity difficult or even harmful. Even if prenatal yoga is generally safe, if she's too ill, forcing her to leave her bed could be counterproductive.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important. She didn't like the gift and called him \"tone deaf.\" Her friends agreed with her. That suggests that maybe the gift wasn't appropriate. The author might not have considered her current physical state and emotional feelings. She's dealing with a tough medical situation, so her needs might not align with his suggestions. Even if his intention was good, the timing or appropriateness of the gift could be an issue. He might have overlooked that she's in a vulnerable state and that such a gift might not be what she needs emotionally or physically.\n\nAlso, the fact that she didn't call to thank him and just gave a look indicates she was hurt or frustrated. The author might not have realized that she might not be in the headspace to engage in yoga, even if it's recommended. Maybe she's already overwhelmed with her health issues, and the gift felt dismissive of her current condition. So, while the intention was to help, the action might have been insensitive to her actual situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. He's trying to help her with depression caused by missing work. But maybe he should have discussed it with her first, or chosen a different kind of gift that allows her to rest but still shows support. For example, maybe something that helps her relax at home. The key here is that he assumed what she needed without consulting her, which could have led to the negative reaction.\n\nIn summary, the author's intentions were good, but the action might have been inappropriate given her severe condition and the fact that she's already on bed rest. The wife's reaction and her friends' agreement suggest that he was tone-deaf to her needs. Therefore, even if he didn't mean to, he might be in the wrong for not considering her current state and not choosing a gift that aligns with her needs.\n"
