She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying a prenatal yoga pass for his pregnant wife, who has hypermesis. The wife is on temporary disability, stays in bed, and gets IV fluids. The husband thought yoga would help her depression from missing work, but she was upset and thought it was a rude \"tone deaf\" present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is dealing with a severe medical condition. Hypermesis gravidarum is more than regular morning sickness; it's constant nausea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and hospital visits. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help her depression by getting her to leave the house and exercise. But maybe he didn't realize the severity of her condition.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband knew about her medical state. He mentions she's on medical leave and stays in bed. Even if he thought yoga would help, if her condition is that severe, maybe she's physically unable to attend classes. The wife's reaction suggests she felt the gift was insensitive, which the husband didn't anticipate. \n\nThe husband's friends agreed with her that he was an asshole, which might indicate that his gesture was indeed tone-deaf. Even if his intentions were good, not considering her current health status and the advice from her doctors could be a misstep. Doctors might not recommend any physical activity for someone with such severe hypermesis. The husband might have overlooked her medical advice and her actual needs during this time.\n\nSo, while the intention was to help, the action might not have been appropriate given her medical condition. The husband didn't check with her doctor or consider that her current state might make yoga impossible or unsafe. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being sensitive to her medical situation.\n"
