She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author bought their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday, but she didn't appreciate it. She has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's staying in bed a lot and only going to the hospital.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that exercise helps with depression, and since the wife misses her job, maybe yoga would help her get some fresh air and feel better. The wife, however, found the gift rude and \"tone deaf\" because she's too sick. Her friends agreed with her that the author was being an asshole. The author is confused and thinks it's rude to criticize the gift.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The wife's condition is pretty severe. She's dealing with constant vomiting, dehydration, needing IV fluids. She's bedridden most of the day. The author, wanting to help, thinks yoga might be beneficial, but maybe didn't consider how she's feeling right now. \n\nEven though prenatal yoga is generally recommended for some pregnant women, in this case, the wife is extremely unwell. She's on temporary disability, which means her doctor probably advised rest. If the author didn't consult with her or the doctor before getting the gift, it might come off as dismissive of her current health issues. The wife's reaction of not thanking him and the friends agreeing with her suggests that the gesture was poorly received. \n\nThe key here is intention vs. impact. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help her feel better. However, the impact was negative because it didn't consider her current physical state and her emotional response. The wife might feel that the author is not taking her condition seriously, implying she should be up and moving when she's actually too sick. Even if the yoga is prenatal, if she's too ill, the gesture might be seen as insensitive. \n\nThe author didn't mention discussing the idea with his wife beforehand or asking if she wanted the class. Gift-giving is subjective, but in this context, not checking in with her about her current health and needs might have led to the wrong choice. The wife's friends' reaction also indicates that the social perception is that the author was inconsiderate. \n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, the action of giving the yoga pass without considering her current medical state and her feelings about it could be seen as the wrong move. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't account for his wife's specific situation and feelings when choosing the gift.\n"
