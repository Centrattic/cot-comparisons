She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving a yoga pass to his pregnant wife. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband noticed she's depressed from missing work and thought yoga would help her get out and feel better. He got her a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday, but she was upset, called him tone-deaf, and her friends agreed she's right.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the wife is very ill, the husband's intention was good, but the gift might not be appropriate given her current condition. Prenatal yoga is generally safe, but if she's too sick and bedridden, maybe it's not the best idea. The wife might feel pressured to do something she's physically unable to do, leading to frustration. The husband didn't consider her current state and how the gift might come across. Even though his intention was to help, the gift might be dismissive of her actual needs. The wife's friends agreeing she's right suggests others see the husband's action as insensitive. So the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and condition properly.\n"
