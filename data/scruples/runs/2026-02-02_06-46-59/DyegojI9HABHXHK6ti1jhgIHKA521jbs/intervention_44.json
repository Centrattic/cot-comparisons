She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for giving their pregnant wife a yoga pass as a birthday gift. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's been very ill, staying in bed, and only going to the hospital for IVs. The husband thought yoga might help with her depression from missing work and wanted her to get out and move. He researched prenatal yoga, got a pass, but she was upset. She didn't thank him and her friends agreed she's right to be critical.\n\nFirst, the husband's intentions seem good\u2014he wants her to feel better and is trying to help. But the key here is the wife's current condition. If she's bedridden and too sick to do yoga, then the gift might be impractical or even hurtful because it doesn't address her actual situation. Even though he meant well, not considering her physical state and possible lack of energy or interest could be seen as not being in tune with her needs. The wife might feel like he's dismissing her illness by suggesting yoga. Also, the friends agreeing that he's an asshole suggests that others see the gift as insensitive. So while the intent was positive, the action might have been thoughtless. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her current health limitations and how the gift could be perceived as minimizing her symptoms.\n"
