She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for giving his pregnant wife a yoga pass as a birthday gift. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's been vomiting a lot, staying in bed, and going to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thinks she might be depressed and wants her to get out and do yoga. He researched prenatal yoga classes, got her a pass, but she didn't like it. She thinks it's rude and he's being tone-deaf. Her friends agreed with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife's condition is serious. Hypermesis gravidarum can be debilitating and requires medical attention. She's not just feeling a bit sick; she's on bed rest, needing IV fluids. The husband's intention is good\u2014he wants her to feel better through exercise, which helps with depression. But maybe he didn't consider her current physical state.\n\nEven though prenatal yoga is generally safe, if she's too ill to move, forcing her to attend a class might not be appropriate. The wife's reaction\u2014giving him a look and not thanking him\u2014indicates she felt it was insensitive. Her friends also think he's an asshole, which suggests that maybe he missed the mark in terms of empathy.\n\nThe key points are her current health status and her emotional state. The husband might not realize how severe her condition is. While his intention is to help, the gift might have felt dismissive of her suffering. She's already on bed rest; expecting her to go to a yoga class might not be feasible or supportive. The husband's friends and wife's agreement that he's at fault indicates that the gesture was perceived as tone-deaf.\n\nSo, even though his intentions are good, the action might not align with her needs right now. The author could have asked her directly if she wanted to do yoga or if there's something else she'd prefer. Instead, he assumed she needed it, which might have come off as disregarding her current limitations. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
