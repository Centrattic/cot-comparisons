She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves buying a yoga pass for their pregnant wife who has hypermesis. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife is 16 weeks pregnant with severe morning sickness (hypermesis) leading to IV treatments and being on temporary disability. She's mostly bedridden and doesn't leave except for medical appointments. The husband, thinking exercise might help her depression and get her out of the house, got her a prenatal yoga pass. However, she didn't like it, thought it was rude, and her friends agreed.\n\nSo, why is there a conflict here? The husband's intention was good: he wants her to feel better and reconnect with exercise. But the wife's condition is severe; she's too sick to exercise. She might feel that the gift is disregarding her current health state. The husband might not realize that even prenatal yoga could be too much for her now, especially if she's severely dehydrated and getting IVs. \n\nHypermesis is more than regular morning sickness; it's a medical condition that requires professional care. The husband's suggestion of yoga could be seen as minimizing her condition. Even with prenatal yoga, if she's too sick to move, it's not feasible. The wife's reaction of being upset and calling him tone-deaf suggests that she felt the gift was insensitive. \n\nThe husband might not have consulted her about her current physical state before getting the pass. Maybe he didn't consider that her medical condition makes yoga impossible right now. Even though his intention was to help, the action doesn't align with her current needs. The friends agreeing with her could indicate that the gesture was indeed inappropriate in this context.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention was to help, so maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the execution might have been off. He should have had a conversation with her about her needs instead of assuming. Since she was on bed rest and getting IVs, yoga might not be a suitable recommendation. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It depends on whether his action disregarded her medical reality. Even with good intentions, not considering her current health status could be seen as tone-deaf. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't account for her condition, even if he thought it was for her benefit. Alternatively, if the intention was good and the action was a mistake without malice, maybe B (No). But given her severe symptoms, the yoga pass seems like a misstep. So likely A is the correct answer.\n"
