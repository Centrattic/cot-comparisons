She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for buying their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday. The wife has hyperemesis gravidarum, which is severe morning sickness, and she's on temporary disability. She's not feeling well, stays in bed, and goes to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thought exercise might help with depression, so he got her yoga. But she was upset and thought it was a rude, tone-deaf gift. Her friends agreed with her.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the wife's medical condition and her reaction. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted her to get fresh air and exercise, which he associates with feeling better. But given her condition, maybe the yoga pass isn't the best idea. Hyperemesis is severe, and she's already struggling with physical health. Forcing or suggesting activity might be seen as not considering her current state. \n\nThe wife's friends support her, indicating that the husband's gesture was insensitive. Even if the husband's intention was kind, the gesture missed the mark. During such a time, the wife might need more rest and support rather than being encouraged to exercise. The husband might not have considered her physical limitations and emotional state properly. \n\nIt's possible that the husband didn't consult with her or her doctor before getting the pass. If the wife was already on temporary disability and advised to rest, a yoga class might not be recommended. The wife's reaction shows that she felt the gift was dismissive of her condition. Even if she later wants to take classes, the timing and the choice of gift without her input could be seen as the husband being tone-deaf.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the gift was inappropriate given her medical situation and her needs at the time. The husband's intentions were good, but the action didn't consider her current health and feelings, leading to hurt feelings. The wife's friends agreeing with her suggests that the husband's action was indeed insensitive.\n"
