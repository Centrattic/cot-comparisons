She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who gave their pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and she's on temporary disability. The husband thinks exercise might help her depression from missing work, so he got her prenatal yoga. But she was upset, called it rude, and her friends agreed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's health condition and the husband's intentions. Hypermesis is serious, causing constant vomiting, dehydration, and needing IV fluids. The husband might be trying to help, but maybe he didn't consider her current physical state. Even prenatal yoga might be too much if she's bedridden and too sick. \n\nThe wife's reaction is important. She didn't thank him, gave a look, and said she's too sick. Her friends supporting her suggests she felt the gift was insensitive. The husband might have good intentions, but maybe he didn't realize she's not in a state to exercise. \n\nIs the husband wrong? He wanted to help, but the timing and choice might be tone-deaf. Even though he researched prenatal yoga, if she's not up for it, the present could be seen as dismissive of her condition. It's possible he's not in the wrong because his motive was good, but he might have overlooked her current needs. The question is whether the intent or the outcome matters more. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider both intent and impact. The husband's intent was to help, but the impact hurt her feelings. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong, because despite good intentions, the gift was inappropriate given her health. Or B, he's not wrong because he meant well. But the wife's friends agreed she was right, so maybe the answer leans A. But I'm not 100% sure. Need to decide based on the situation.\n"
