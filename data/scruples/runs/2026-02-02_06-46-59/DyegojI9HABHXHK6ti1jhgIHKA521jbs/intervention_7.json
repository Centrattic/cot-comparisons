She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for giving their pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday.\n\nFirst, the wife is 16 weeks pregnant and suffering from hypermesis, which is a severe form of morning sickness that causes constant nausea and vomiting, even at night. She's on temporary disability and stays in bed most of the time, only going out for IV fluids. The husband thinks she's depressed from missing her job and wants her to exercise and get out more. He researched prenatal yoga and bought a pass for her, but she was upset and thinks it's a rude gift, even calling him tone-deaf. Her friends agreed with her.\n\nThe husband's intention was to help her feel better through exercise and fresh air, but the wife's current condition is such that she's too sick to engage in yoga. The husband didn't consider that her physical state might prevent her from using the pass. Even though he did his research, he might not have fully understood her current limitations. The wife felt criticized, as if he's implying she's not doing enough to take care of herself, which could be a sensitive point during pregnancy. The friends' reaction also suggests that the gesture was perceived as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's motive was to support her well-being. He might have thought yoga would help her mental health, not realizing the severity of her condition. But the key here is whether his action was inconsiderate given her current state. Since she's very ill and confined to bed, expecting her to attend yoga classes might be impractical and could make her feel worse. The wife's reaction indicates that she felt the gift was dismissive of her condition. \n\nSo, while the husband had good intentions, the action might have been inappropriate because it didn't account for her actual physical state. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the gesture, though well-meaning, failed to consider her current medical limitations and emotional state.\n"
