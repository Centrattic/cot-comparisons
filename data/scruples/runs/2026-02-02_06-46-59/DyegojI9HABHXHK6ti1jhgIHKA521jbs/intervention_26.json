She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who bought the yoga pass is wrong. The situation is that his wife is 16 weeks pregnant with a condition called hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes out for hospital visits. He thinks she's depressed from missing work and wants her to get fresh air and exercise, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. But she was upset, gave him a look, and her friends agreed that he's being an asshole. The author is confused because he thinks he's helping, but she's mad.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's medical condition and the husband's intentions. Hypermesis is really serious; it's not just morning sickness. She's dehydrated and needs IV fluids. She's on bed rest, so moving around isn't easy. The husband's idea is to encourage her to do yoga, which he thinks helps with depression. But maybe he didn't consider her current physical state. Even prenatal yoga might be too much for someone who's severely ill and on bed rest. Also, he bought the pass without her input. Maybe she's in no condition to exercise, and the present was well-meaning but inconsiderate of her actual needs. She might be feeling invalidated or criticized for her condition. Plus, she didn't even thank him, which shows she was hurt. The friends agreeing with her suggests that others see his action as insensitive. The husband might have thought he was helping, but his action didn't account for her medical advice and current state. He should have checked with her or her doctor before getting such a gift. So, maybe he's in the wrong because he made an assumption about what she needed without considering her actual health situation. Answer A.\n"
