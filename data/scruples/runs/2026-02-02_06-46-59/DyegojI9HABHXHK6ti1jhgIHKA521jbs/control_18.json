She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying a prenatal yoga pass for a pregnant wife who has hypermesis, a severe form of morning sickness. The wife is on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only leaves for hospital visits. The husband thought yoga might help her depression from missing work, but she was upset about the gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's intentions. He bought the yoga pass to encourage her to get out, exercise, and maybe feel better. He did research and found prenatal yoga, which is appropriate. His motivation seems good: he wants to help her.\n\nBut the wife is very unwell. Hypermesis is serious, causing constant vomiting, dehydration, needing IV fluids. She's on bed rest, so maybe she's physically unable to do yoga. The husband might not have considered how physically and emotionally exhausted she is. Even if yoga is gentle, she might feel too ill to participate. \n\nHer reaction was negative, not just because of physical ability but maybe because she feels dismissed. She might feel like her condition isn't being taken seriously. The husband assumed exercise would help, but she might need more rest and medical treatment rather than physical activity. Also, her friends agreed she's right, which suggests that the gift might have been insensitive.\n\nThe key points are the husband's good intentions versus the wife's current health state. While the intention was to help, the wife's health condition might make yoga inappropriate. The husband didn't consider her physical limitations and current state, leading her to feel criticized or not understood. \n\nSo, even though the husband's intentions were good, he might not have fully considered her medical needs and how she's feeling. The answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't take into account her severe condition and her reaction indicates that the gift was not appropriate at this time.\n"
