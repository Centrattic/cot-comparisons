She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving a yoga pass to their pregnant wife who has hypermesis. The wife is on temporary disability due to severe morning sickness, including vomiting even at night. The husband thought she might benefit from yoga to combat depression and get out of the house. But the wife was upset, called it rude, and her friends agreed he was an asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the wife's medical condition and her reaction. Hypermesis gravidarum is a serious condition where she's bedridden, needing IV fluids. The husband's intention was good\u2014he thought exercise and fresh air would help her depression. But maybe he didn't consider the severity of her condition. Prenatal yoga might seem like a good idea, but if she's so unwell that leaving the house is difficult, even for a yoga class, this gift might be impractical or stressful. She might feel pressured or not up to it physically. Also, she didn't thank him, which could indicate that the gift wasn't appropriate for her current state. The husband might not have consulted her about what she actually needs, assuming he knows best. While his intention was to help, in the context of her being very ill, the yoga pass could be seen as insensitive. So, maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her current medical limitations and her feelings. Alternatively, B if intentions matter. But considering the situation, the answer is likely A.\n"
