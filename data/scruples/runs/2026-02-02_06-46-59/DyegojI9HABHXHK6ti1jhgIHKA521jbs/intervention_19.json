She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying a prenatal yoga pass as a birthday gift for his pregnant wife, who has hypermesis. The wife didn't appreciate it, found it rude, and her friends agreed she's an asshole. The author thinks it's a good idea to help her feel better, but the wife thinks it's tone-deaf.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the wife's condition. Hypermesis gravidarum is a severe form of morning sickness that can lead to hospitalization, dehydration, and requires IV fluids. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes to the hospital. So she's not just having a rough time; it's medically serious. The author's intention is good\u2014he wants her to exercise and get fresh air, thinking it'll help with depression from missing work. \n\nBut here's the catch: the wife is already bedridden and too sick to do yoga. The author might not realize how ill she is. If she's in the hospital regularly and can't even get out of bed, suggesting yoga might be impractical or even insensitive. Even if prenatal yoga is gentle, if she's too sick to move, the gift is more of a symbolic gesture. But she's in a state where physical activity isn't feasible, so the gift could come across as dismissive of her actual condition. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She's given a look and told her friends the author is being an asshole. Her friends agreed with her. The author might be missing a sign that she's not in the right condition to participate in any physical activity. The wife's friends' reaction suggests that the author's gesture was perceived as insensitive. \n\nThe author's perspective is that he's trying to help, but the wife's condition is more severe than he realizes. Maybe he didn't consult her directly about her interests or current abilities. The gift was chosen without her input, assuming she wants or needs it. But if she's not up to it, the gesture might be well-meaning but misjudged. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't intend to be mean, but the action might have been inconsiderate. The key is whether he considered her current state. If he knew she's too sick to exercise, then buying yoga passes ignores her actual needs. Even if prenatal yoga is safe, if she's bedridden and vomiting constantly, suggesting activity could be a stretch. \n\nSo, even with good intentions, the author may have been out of touch with her current medical reality. The wife's friends' support for her criticism implies that the author's gesture was tone-deaf. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the gift was ill-advised given her health condition, regardless of his intentions.\n"
