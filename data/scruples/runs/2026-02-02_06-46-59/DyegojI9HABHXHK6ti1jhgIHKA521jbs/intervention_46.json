She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting a prenatal yoga pass for their wife as a birthday present. The wife is pregnant and has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thinks she's depressed from missing work and wants her to get some exercise and fresh air, so he got her yoga. But she's upset, thinks the gift is rude, and her friends agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's intentions. He wants to help her feel better by encouraging movement and maybe improving her mood. But he didn't consult with her before getting the gift. Even though he researched prenatal yoga, maybe he didn't realize how severe her condition is. Hypermesis can make any form of exercise impossible because of the nausea and fatigue. The wife is already bedridden, so suggesting yoga might be seen as dismissive of her current health state. \n\nThe husband might not be aware of the physical limitations caused by her condition. However, he did mention she's on medical leave and gets IV fluids, which indicates she's not in a position to do physical activities. The wife's reaction is a mix of physical inability and feeling disrespected. The friends agreeing with her suggests that the gift was indeed insensitive. \n\nEven with good intentions, the husband didn't communicate with his wife about her needs. Gifts like these should be discussed beforehand, especially when the recipient is dealing with a health issue. The husband assumed she would benefit from yoga, but she might see it as pushing her to do something she's not capable of. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not considering her current medical situation and not discussing the gift with her. Even if the intent was to help, the timing and the nature of the gift might have been inappropriate. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't align the gift with her actual needs and feelings, leading to her feeling disrespected. Answer A.\n"
