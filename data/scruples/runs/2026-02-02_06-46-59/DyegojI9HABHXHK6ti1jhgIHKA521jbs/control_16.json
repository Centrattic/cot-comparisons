She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for buying a yoga pass for their pregnant wife. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's been bedridden, going to the hospital for IVs. The husband thought she might benefit from exercise and fresh air, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. However, she was upset when she received it, her friends agreed she was right, and she thinks it's a rude or tone-deaf gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help his wife feel better, especially since he knows exercise helps with depression and she misses her job. He researched prenatal yoga, so he tried to be thoughtful. On the other hand, the wife is extremely ill, and her condition is making her feel isolated and unwell. Being asked to do yoga might feel like a pressure to be active when her body is not allowing her to. She might feel that the gift is dismissive of her current state, implying she should be able to do more than she physically can. Her friends agreeing with her suggests that the gesture might have been misunderstood or misjudged in terms of her current needs.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health condition and how the gift was received. The husband might not have considered how the gift could be perceived as disregarding her severe symptoms. Even though his intention was to help, the act of giving a yoga pass might have inadvertently made her feel that her illness isn't being taken seriously. The wife's reaction\u2014being critical and her friends agreeing\u2014indicates that the gesture was not appreciated, possibly because it clashed with her current physical and emotional state.\n\nThe husband's response to her criticism is also important. He says he doesn't think he's in the wrong and is considering getting another present. However, the fact that she felt the yoga pass was rude and her friends supported her suggests that the husband might have overlooked her specific needs and how the gift could be perceived during her illness. Even though he had good intentions, the outcome is that his wife felt criticized or pressured, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nSo, while the husband's motive was to help, the action might have been ill-received. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife's health is a significant factor here, and the gift might have been seen as insensitive to her current state, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, it's a nuanced situation because the intention was positive. But the impact on the wife's feelings matters here. The wife's condition is severe, and suggesting yoga might not have been the best approach despite the good intentions. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
