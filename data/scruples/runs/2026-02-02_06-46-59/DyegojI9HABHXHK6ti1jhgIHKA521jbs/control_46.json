She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong after giving his pregnant wife a yoga pass for her birthday.\n\nFirst, the wife is 16 weeks pregnant and has hypermesis gravidarum, which is severe morning sickness. She's on temporary disability, bedridden, and only going to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thinks she's depressed missing her job and wants her to leave the house, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. However, she was upset, didn't thank him, and her friends said he was an asshole for being tone-deaf.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that exercise helps him with depression, so he thinks it might help her. But the wife's condition is severe\u2014she's already struggling with constant vomiting, dehydration, and needs medical care. She might feel that yoga isn't appropriate given her current state. The husband didn't consult her or the doctor about this gift, assuming her condition could be alleviated by yoga. \n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. The key points are: intention vs. outcome. He wanted to help, but the gift was ill-received. Was it inconsiderate? Maybe. He didn't consider that she might be too unwell to participate, and giving a gift that requires her to leave the house and exercise when she's in bed most of the time is not practical. The wife felt it was rude, and her friends agreed. So, even if his intention was good, the action might have been insensitive to her current condition. He should have prioritized her immediate needs and consulted her instead of assuming what she needed. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
