She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the yoga pass for their pregnant wife is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which sounds really severe morning sickness. She's on medical leave and spends most days in bed, only going to the hospital for IVs. The husband thinks exercise would help her depression from missing work, so he got her a prenatal yoga pass. But she didn't appreciate it, called it rude, and her friends agree with her.\n\nHmm. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wants her to feel better. But the wife is too sick to do yoga and feels the gift is insensitive. Even though it's prenatal yoga, she's currently in a bad health state. Maybe he didn't consider her current condition and how she's feeling. Gift-giving during such a time requires empathy. If she's physically unable and emotionally stressed, a yoga pass might not be the right thing right now. He might have overlooked her actual needs and feelings, even if his intention was to help.\n\nBut then again, maybe he's trying to encourage her to get out of the house. However, if she's too sick, forcing her to do yoga might not be feasible. The key points are her current health status and her emotional response. She thinks it's tone-deaf, and her friends back her up. It's possible he didn't communicate with her about what she actually needs or wants, assuming that what works for him (exercise) would work for her. Maybe he should have asked instead of assuming. So, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he didn't consider her actual situation and feelings.\n"
