I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K after a fire drill incident. The situation is that the author's son had a house fire when he was 3, and two days later, they sent him back to school. The school did a fire drill without warning the parents, which caused the child to panic because he was confused, thinking the fire was real and his family didn't come to get him. The author was upset and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They were trying to maintain normalcy for their kids after a traumatic event. It's understandable that they were stressed and dealing with a lot, but they still wanted their son to have a routine. However, the school's decision to conduct a fire drill without considering the recent trauma seems negligent. A 3-year-old who just experienced a fire might be more sensitive to such drills. The school should have made an exception or at least checked with the parents before proceeding. \n\nThe director's response about the calendar being a public notice doesn't seem sufficient. The parents had informed the director about the fire the night before, so the school should have been aware of the child's situation and taken appropriate precautions. The teacher didn't mention the drill when the parent dropped the child off, which is a key point. The school's duty is to the safety and well-being of the children, and after knowing about the recent trauma, they should have ensured the child's comfort.\n\nNow, the author's reaction: they were \"heated\" and demanded to know who thought it was a good idea. While the parent admits they were harsh, the school's actions were careless. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's lack of empathy and consideration. The director's justification doesn't address the child's emotional state. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school didn't follow up after being informed of the parents' situation. They should have adjusted the drill's approach or at least communicated better. The parent's outburst was a response to this negligence, so they might not be in the wrong. The key issue here is the school's failure to accommodate the child's recent trauma, not the parent's initial decision to send him back to school. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong; the school's actions were the problem.\n"
