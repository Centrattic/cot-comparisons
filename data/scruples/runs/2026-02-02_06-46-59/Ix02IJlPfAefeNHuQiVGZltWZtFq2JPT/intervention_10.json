I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. \n\nFirst, the context: The parent's house caught fire a few days before, and they were displaced. They continued sending their 3-year-old to pre-K to keep things normal. The school did a fire drill without informing the parent, which upset the child because he didn't understand why his family didn't come out. The parent got angry and yelled at the director.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The parent made sure to inform the school about the fire and their son's situation before sending him. The school had a calendar with activities, but they didn't check in with the parent about the drill. The parent was already stressed from the fire, which is a traumatic event for a family. The child is only 3, so a fire drill might be confusing or scary, especially right after experiencing a real fire.\n\nThe school's responsibility here is to be considerate of the child's emotional state. Even if the fire drills are part of the regular calendar, they should have made an exception given the recent trauma. The parent had already communicated the situation, so the school's failure to adjust the drill or inform the parent is a problem. The parent's reaction, while harsh, comes from a place of concern for their child's well-being. \n\nHowever, the parent could have responded in a calmer, more constructive way instead of losing their temper. But considering the circumstances, their frustration is understandable. The school's lack of communication and empathy plays a significant role here. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to the school's oversight. The parent isn't entirely in the wrong because the school didn't take the necessary precautions. The parent had valid reasons for being upset, even if their response was harsh. Therefore, the answer leans towards B.\n"
