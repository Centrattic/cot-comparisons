I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who had a house fire and then sent their 3-year-old to pre-K. The school did a fire drill without warning, which upset the child, and the parent got angry with the director. The question is whether the parent is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The child was three, and after a traumatic house fire, the school conducted a fire drill. The parent had informed the director about the fire the night before, but when dropping off the kid, they didn't check the calendar which had the fire drill scheduled. The school didn't mention the drill during drop-off, and the parent went off on the director for not considering the child's trauma.\n\nSo, the parent's argument is that the school was negligent in not informing them about the fire drill given the recent trauma. The school's defense is that it was on the calendar, which parents are expected to check. But the parent was in the building and didn't see the calendar because they were focused on buying clothes for their family. The director didn't proactively inform the parent about the drill despite knowing the situation.\n\nI think the school's responsibility is to ensure the safety of the children, including handling fire drills. However, they should also be aware of a child's specific circumstances, especially after a traumatic event. Even if the drill is on the calendar, the school should make sure that parents are informed, perhaps more directly. The parent didn't check the calendar, but maybe the school should have considered the child's situation and not proceeded with the drill without prior notice. Especially since the parent had already communicated the recent fire, it's reasonable to expect some accommodation. The parent being angry seems justified, but the way they reacted might be seen as harsh. However, the main issue is the school's failure to adjust for the child's trauma. So the parent isn't in the wrong, but the school is. The answer should be B, No.\n"
