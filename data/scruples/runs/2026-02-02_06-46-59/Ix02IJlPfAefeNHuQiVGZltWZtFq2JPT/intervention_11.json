I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who took their 3-year-old to pre-K after a house fire, and the school did a fire drill without warning the kid, leading to him getting upset. The parent then \"ripped the school a new one\" and is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parent's perspective: They had a traumatic event, a house fire, and wanted to keep their child's routine as normal as possible. They informed the school director beforehand about the situation and even met with the teacher. The school then conducted a fire drill without considering the child's emotional state. The parent was upset because the kid was distressed when he saw other kids going through the drill but not his parents. The parent confronts the director, who just says it was on the calendar. The parent is angry because they weren't warned when dropping off the kid, so they didn't prepare him for the drill.\n\nThe school's perspective: They might have followed standard procedures. Fire drills are part of safety protocols, and they might have assumed that all parents were aware because it was on the calendar. They might not have considered the specific circumstances of this child, who had just been through a fire. However, the director didn't check in with the parent when they dropped off the kid, even though the parent had informed them about the situation. The school's response of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive, not empathetic.\n\nNow, evaluating the parent's actions: They were already under a lot of stress from the fire. The school's decision to do a fire drill without considering the child's trauma might have been a mistake. The parent's reaction was harsh, but given the context, their frustration is understandable. They informed the school, but the school didn't take extra precautions. The parent's outburst was probably due to their child's distress and the school's lack of sensitivity.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, they did inform the school, and the school's response was dismissive. The parent's anger comes from the school's failure to make accommodations. While they were harsh, their reaction is a result of the school's negligence in this specific case. So, the parent is not in the wrong because the school didn't consider the child's situation after being informed. The answer is B.\n"
