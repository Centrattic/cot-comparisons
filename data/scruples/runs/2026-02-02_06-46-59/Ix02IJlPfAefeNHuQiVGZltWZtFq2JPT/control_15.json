I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the parent in the story) is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parent's house burned down when their son was 3. They wanted to keep things normal, so they continued sending him to pre-K. The school did a fire drill without warning, which upset the child because he didn't understand why his family didn't come out. The parent was upset and yelled at the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar and the child needed to get used to drills.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the parent was wrong to react that way. Let's break it down.\n\nThe school's responsibility: Pre-Ks usually have fire drills as part of safety protocols. However, the parent had informed the school about the recent trauma. The director might have known the situation but still proceeded. The parent didn't check the calendar, but maybe the school should have made an exception given the circumstances. The child was 3, and after a real fire, a drill could be traumatic. The school might not have considered the child's emotional state, which could be a failure on their part.\n\nThe parent's reaction: They lost their home and were in a stressful situation, trying to keep their child's routine. The school didn't mention the drill when the parent dropped the kid off, even though the parent had specifically informed them about the fire. The parent was upset because the school didn't show empathy or adjust the drill for a child who had just experienced a real fire. Losing their temper was harsh, but was it justified?\n\nIn terms of right and wrong: Schools are supposed to prioritize children's safety and well-being. If the school ignored the parent's information and proceeded with a drill that caused trauma, they might be at fault. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's negligence in this context. However, the parent could have handled the situation more calmly instead of yelling. But their emotional state was likely heightened due to the recent trauma. \n\nSo, the parent's error might be not checking the calendar, but the school's error is not accommodating a child who had a real fire experience. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the school's actions were questionable, the parent's reaction, though harsh, might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (the parent is not in the wrong).\n"
