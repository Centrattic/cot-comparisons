I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent getting angry at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill during a stressful time when their family had a house fire. The parent sent their 3-year-old to school two days after the incident, and the school conducted a fire drill without considering the child's trauma. The parent then confronts the director and yells at her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The family had a house fire, a traumatic event. They tried to maintain normalcy for the kids by sending the son to pre-K. The school had a fire drill, which the parent found inappropriate given the recent trauma. The parent was upset that the school didn't inform them about the drill when they dropped off the child. The director's response was that it was on the calendar, but they didn't check it. The parent then lost their temper.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: They called the director beforehand to inform them about the fire. When dropping off, they met with the teacher but didn't check the calendar, which had the fire drill scheduled. The school didn't communicate the drill on the day of, assuming the parent saw the calendar. But the parent didn't check it because they were busy dealing with their own situation.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable given the context. The child was recently traumatized by a fire, and the school proceeded with a fire drill without considering his emotional state. The director's justification was that it was on the calendar, but the parent didn't see it. The school might be at fault for not ensuring that all parents were informed, especially in a sensitive case. However, the parent could have checked the calendar themselves, even if briefly, to avoid the situation. But considering the overwhelming circumstances the parent was dealing with (no clothes, insurance claims, etc.), maybe they couldn't be expected to check every detail.\n\nThe parent's reaction was harsh, but was it justified? The school's failure to communicate adequately, especially given the child's trauma, seems to be a significant issue. However, the parent could have asked about the calendar or the schedule when they met with the teacher. The fact that they didn't check might imply some responsibility on their part. But the school should have made sure that in such a sensitive time, they weren't conducting drills that could re-traumatize the child. The director's lack of empathy and failure to adjust the situation for the child's well-being is problematic.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. The parent could have checked the schedule, but the school should have been more considerate and proactive in communication. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's negligence in a sensitive matter. However, the parent's response was to \"rip them a new one,\" which might be excessive, but the initial fault lies with the school. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the school's actions were more at fault, and the parent's anger is a reaction to that negligence.\n"
