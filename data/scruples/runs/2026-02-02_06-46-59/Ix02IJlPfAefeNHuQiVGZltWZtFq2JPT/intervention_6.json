I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's son was in a pre-K program. They had a house fire, and two days later, they decided to send their son to school to maintain some normalcy. The author called the director to inform them about the fire. When dropping off the kid, the author met with the teacher and informed her but didn't check the calendar. The next day, the school did a fire drill without any prior warning, which upset the child because he didn't understand why his family wasn't there. The author got angry and yelled at the director, who defended it by saying it was on the calendar. The author is now asking if they were in the wrong for losing their temper.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The school had a fire drill scheduled, which was on the monthly calendar. The author didn't check the calendar when dropping off the kid. The director might have expected that if the parents saw the calendar, they would know about the fire drill and prepare the child. But the author didn't check the calendar. Also, the director didn't personally inform the parents about the fire drill despite knowing the family's situation. \n\nWait, the author had already informed the school about the house fire. So when they dropped the kid off, the teacher was aware. The director's explanation was that it was on the calendar. But if the parents were in a stressful situation, maybe the school should have made an exception. The child was just 3 and had just been through a traumatic event. Doing an unannounced fire drill might be too much for him. \n\nThe author's anger is understandable. The school didn't seem to take the family's situation into account. The director didn't make an effort to inform them about the fire drill despite knowing about the fire. The author didn't check the calendar, which is a factor, but the school's responsibility includes the safety and well-being of the children. If the child was in distress because of the drill, maybe the school should have adjusted their procedures. \n\nSo the author's reaction might be justified. The school director's response seems dismissive. She didn't consider the child's trauma. The author was under a lot of stress and just wanted to maintain normalcy. However, the author didn't check the calendar, which could have been a way to know about the drill. But maybe the school should have made an exception given the circumstances. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for yelling? Maybe not entirely, considering the stress and the child's well-being. The school's approach was probably insensitive. So I think the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
