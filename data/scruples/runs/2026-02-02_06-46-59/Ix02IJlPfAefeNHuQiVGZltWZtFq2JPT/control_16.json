I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for being angry at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. \n\nFirst, the context: The family had a house fire a few days before, and they wanted to keep their son's routine as normal as possible. They sent him to pre-K, thinking it would be good for him. The author called the director to inform them about the fire but didn't check the calendar. The school did a fire drill without warning the child, which scared him because he didn't understand and thought his family was trapped. The director's response was that it was on the calendar and that the child needed to be prepared for such situations.\n\nSo, the key points here. The school had a fire drill scheduled, which was on the calendar. The author didn't check the calendar when she dropped off the child, even though she had previously informed the director. The school didn't inform the parents again at drop-off, assuming the calendar was sufficient. The child was upset during the drill, and the parent lost her temper with the director.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The school's responsibility is to ensure the safety of the children. Fire drills are standard procedures for this. However, after a recent traumatic event (the fire), the school might have needed to adjust their approach. The director's reasoning is that the child should be accustomed to drills for safety. But the child was only 3 and had just experienced a real fire. The school didn't take into account the child's trauma and didn't provide any additional support or warnings, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAs for the parent, she did inform the director about the fire before the drill. She might have expected the school to be more accommodating given the circumstances. The fact that the school didn't mention the drill at drop-off, even after being informed about the family's situation, could be a misstep. The parent's anger is understandable due to her child's distress. While she was \"harsh,\" there's a valid reason for her reaction. The school's failure to consider the child's well-being in this scenario could mean the parent's response was justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the school might argue that fire drills are mandatory and must be conducted regularly. They might also say that the calendar was the standard method of communication, and the parent didn't check it. However, in a situation where a child has recently experienced a traumatic event, the school has a duty to be more proactive in ensuring that such drills don't cause unnecessary harm. The director's response of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive and not empathetic enough.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent's main issue was not checking the calendar, but the school's responsibility was to communicate effectively and take the child's situation into account. If the school knew about the fire, they should have made an effort to prevent the drill from happening on that day or to provide a more supportive environment during the drill. The parent's outburst might have been inappropriate, but it's a reaction to a situation where the school's actions could be seen as negligent.\n\nTherefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong. The school's handling of the situation, especially after being informed of the recent trauma, could have been better. The parent's anger stems from concern for her child's well-being, and the school's lack of empathy in the director's response might have been the bigger issue here.\n"
