I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. The situation involves a lot of context, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The parent's son was in a pre-K program. They had a house fire right before his third birthday and had to evacuate. They wanted to keep the child's routine normal, so they continued sending him to school. The parent informed the school director about the fire and the child's attendance. However, the school conducted a fire drill without warning the child, leading to him being upset because his family didn't come out during the drill. The parent was angry when informed and confronted the director, who said it was on the calendar and that the child needed to get used to drills. The parent is now questioning if they were in the wrong for their outburst.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The school conducted a fire drill without informing the parent, even after being told about the recent traumatic event.\n2. The child was three years old, which is very young, and the parent argues that the child couldn't handle the stress of a surprise fire drill after the fire.\n3. The school's response was to say it was on the calendar, implying that the parent should have checked, but the parent didn't because they were busy dealing with the aftermath of the fire.\n\nNow, considering the parent's reaction. They were already under a lot of stress from the house fire, which is a traumatic event. The school's action could be seen as insensitive, especially when they knew about the parent's situation. The director's response of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive of the parent's specific circumstances. The parent was trying to maintain normalcy for their child, and the school's action undermined that by causing the child distress.\n\nFrom a common-sense perspective, schools usually have fire drills, but when a child has just experienced a real fire, it's reasonable to expect that the school would be more considerate. The director's failure to accommodate the child's trauma and the lack of communication (even though the parent didn't check the calendar) could be seen as the school's fault. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's negligence in this specific context.\n\nHowever, the parent did call the director to inform them about the situation. The director's responsibility would be to ensure that all staff are aware and to make necessary accommodations. The fact that the director used the calendar as an excuse without considering the child's recent trauma suggests that the school didn't handle it properly. The parent's outburst, while perhaps harsh, was in response to a situation where the school didn't take the necessary steps to protect the child's emotional well-being.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, it seems like the school is more at fault here. The parent's reaction, while intense, is understandable given the circumstances. They were under stress, and the school's action was inconsiderate. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong for their reaction.\n"
