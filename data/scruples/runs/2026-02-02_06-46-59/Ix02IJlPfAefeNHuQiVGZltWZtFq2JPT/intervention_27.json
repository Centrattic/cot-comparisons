I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who was upset with their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill without prior notice, especially after their home had a fire.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The child was three years old and had just experienced a house fire. The school conducted a fire drill during his first day back, which caused him distress. The parent was informed after the fact and reacted strongly to the director. The parent is now questioning if they were wrong to be angry and confront the school.\n\nThe parent's perspective is that the school was insensitive. The child was only three, and the fire drill made him panic because he didn't understand and expected his family to come get him. The school's response was to say it was on the calendar and that the child needed to be prepared for such drills. The parent felt the school should have known about the situation and adjusted the drill.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: they informed the school about the fire, dropped off the child, but didn't check the calendar. The school claims they followed their usual procedures. The parent's outburst might be seen as justified given the child's trauma, but maybe the parent could have checked the calendar or ensured the school was aware to skip the drill. However, schools often have mandatory drills for safety, which can be confusing for young children. The director's response (\"it was on the calendar\") might indicate a lack of empathy here.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent's intention was to keep the child in a normal routine after a traumatic event. The school might have a responsibility to accommodate such a situation, especially if informed. However, standard procedures might not have an easy override. The parent's anger was targeted at the school's lack of consideration, which is a reasonable reaction given the child's age and trauma. The director's response was dismissive, which probably escalated the parent's frustration. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent could have checked the calendar, but they were dealing with a crisis and might not have noticed. The school's failure to communicate the drill when the parent informed them of the situation seems like a key point. So, the parent's reaction might be justified because the school didn't make an exception even after being told about the recent traumatic event. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut I should also consider if the parent overreacted. They admitted they were harsh. The school might have done what they thought was right. However, the school's lack of empathy and failure to adjust for a child who had just experienced a fire could make the parent's outburst understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent might not be in the wrong (B) because the school's actions were insensitive and disruptive to the child's emotional well-being, especially after being informed of the family's situation. The school's rigid adherence to the calendar without considering the child's trauma is questionable, so the parent's reaction is justified.\n"
