I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent being upset with their child's pre-K school after a fire drill caused the child distress. The parent had recently gone through a house fire and wanted to keep things normal for their 3-year-old. The school did a fire drill without warning, leading to the child being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The parent called the director to inform them about the fire, and the director didn't mention the fire drill. The parent was in a difficult situation, dealing with the aftermath of a fire, and just wanted to keep their child's routine stable. The school's reasoning was that the child needed to get used to fire drills, which are on the calendar. However, they failed to communicate with the parent, who had specifically informed them of the traumatic event.\n\nThe parent's reaction was heated, but the school's actions seem to lack empathy and consideration for the child's recent trauma. The director's response about the calendar being public knowledge doesn't account for the parent's specific request to be informed. The parent had a right to expect that the school would adjust the child's experience given the circumstances. The school not only didn't adjust but proceeded with the drill, which caused unnecessary distress. \n\nSo, the parent's outburst was a result of the school's failure to accommodate a child in a vulnerable state. The parent's anger is justified because the school didn't show proper care or communication. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
