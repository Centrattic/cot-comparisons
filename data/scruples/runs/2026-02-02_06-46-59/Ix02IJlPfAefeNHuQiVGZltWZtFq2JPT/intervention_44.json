I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a parent who took their 3-year-old to pre-K after a house fire, and the school did a fire drill without telling them or preparing the child. The parent got really upset and yelled at the director.\n\nFirst, the parent's side: They had a traumatic house fire, which is a huge stressor. They wanted to keep their son's routine as normal as possible, so they continued his pre-K. The school had a fire drill, which the child wasn't prepared for, leading to him being upset. The parent was already under a lot of stress, and the school's actions caused more distress for the child and them. The parent felt that the school should have known about the situation and adjusted the drill, especially since the child just turned 3 and might not understand such drills. The parent admitted they were harsh but was upset because the director only mentioned the calendar and didn't address the lack of communication.\n\nFrom the school's perspective: They might have a policy of regular fire drills to ensure safety. The director says it was on the calendar, so maybe they assumed everyone was aware. They might not have thought to accommodate a specific child's situation unless explicitly asked. The teacher might not have communicated with the parent upon drop-off about the drill, which is a point of contention.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: The parent did inform the school about the fire and their intention to keep the child in pre-K. They didn't check the calendar, which had the drill listed. However, the school didn't explicitly mention the drill when the parent met with the teacher, which could have been a point of confusion. The parent's anger is about the lack of communication and sensitivity, especially given the child's recent trauma. \n\nThe parent's reaction was strong, but the school's failure to consider the child's trauma and the parent's communication might be at fault. The parent didn't ask specifically about the drill, but the school should have made an exception given the circumstances. The director's response of \"it's on the calendar\" suggests a lack of empathy and not considering the child's needs. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They were stressed, but the school's inflexibility and lack of communication contributed to the problem. The parent's anger stems from the school not showing understanding. Therefore, the parent's outburst is understandable, even if their approach was harsh. The fault might be more on the school's side for not accommodating the child's situation. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
