I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at the pre-K director over a fire drill with their 3-year-old.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's family had a house fire when their son was 3. They tried to keep things normal by continuing his pre-K schedule. The director didn't mention the fire drill when the mom dropped off the kid. The kid was upset because he didn't understand the drill and thought his family didn't come back, so the mom was angry and lost her temper with the director.\n\nThe key points here are: the kid was 3 years old, recently traumatized by a fire, the school had a fire drill without informing the parents, and the director only referenced the calendar as an excuse. The mom had already informed the school about the fire, so they should have been aware of the child's situation. The director's response seems dismissive and lacking empathy.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's understandable that the mom was upset. The school's failure to communicate something so important, especially knowing the child's recent trauma, is a major oversight. Fire drills for a 3-year-old might be standard, but in this specific context, it's inconsiderate. The director didn't seem to take the situation seriously, which justified the mom's frustration. However, the mom's reaction was harsh. While the school is at fault, losing her temper and being heated might have been an overreaction, even if understandable. So the author might not be in the wrong, but maybe she could have handled it more calmly. The main issue is the school's negligence, not the parent's anger. So the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
