I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent was wrong to be angry at their child's preschool for conducting a fire drill shortly after a house fire. \n\nFirst, the situation: The child's family had a house fire, and they were traumatized. The parent wanted to keep the child's routine as normal as possible, so they continued sending him to pre-K. The parent informed the school about the fire before dropping him off. However, the school decided to do a fire drill without warning the parent or the child, leading to the child's distress when he realized his family wasn't there during the drill.\n\nThe parent confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar. The parent then \"ripped her a new one.\" The question is whether the parent was in the wrong for reacting that way.\n\nFrom a childcare perspective, it's generally accepted that trauma-informed practices should be considered. After a traumatic event like a fire, it's important to avoid re-traumatizing the child. Conducting a fire drill immediately afterward without considering the child's emotional state could be seen as negligent. The school had been informed about the situation but didn't adjust the routine, which shows a lack of empathy or understanding. \n\nThe parent's reaction, while perhaps harsh, seems to stem from concern for their child's well-being. The school's failure to communicate and accommodate the child's needs could justify the parent's anger. However, the parent could have approached the issue more calmly to address the problem without losing their temper. \n\nSo, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong. The school's actions were inappropriate, but maybe the parent's response could have been more constructive. However, given the circumstances, the parent's anger is understandable. The answer hinges on whether the parent's reaction was justified given the school's actions. I think the parent is not in the wrong because the school failed to act appropriately.\n"
