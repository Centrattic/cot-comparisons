I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after yelling at their child's pre-K school for doing a fire drill.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kid had a house fire, and the parents wanted to keep things normal. They sent him back to school two days later. The school did a fire drill without warning, which upset the child. The parent was angry and confronted the director, who said it was on the calendar. The parent is now wondering if they were wrong to get angry.\n\nHmm. The key points here: the child just went through a traumatic event, the parents were trying to keep things stable, the school did a fire drill without informing them despite the child's situation. The director's justification was that it was on the calendar, but the parent didn't see it because they were in a hurry. \n\nSo, the school's responsibility is to the child's well-being. If the child has just experienced a fire, a fire drill could be retraumatizing. The school should have known about the situation and adjusted their approach. The director didn't mention it when the parent dropped off the child, even after being informed. That's a problem. \n\nThe parent did contact the director beforehand to let them know about the fire, so the school was aware of the context. The director's response was to say it's on the calendar, which doesn't account for the child's specific needs. The parent's reaction, while perhaps harsh, seems justified given the circumstances. The school didn't show empathy or make accommodations, which is their responsibility. \n\nSo the parent isn't in the wrong. The school failed to consider the child's trauma and didn't communicate properly. The answer should be B (No).\n"
