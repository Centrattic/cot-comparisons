I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who was upset with their child's pre-K school for doing a fire drill without considering their recent house fire. The parent's son was just 3 years old and had a traumatic experience when the fire happened. The school decided to do a fire drill, which upset the child, and the parent lost their temper with the director.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: they were dealing with a recent house fire, which is a major trauma. They wanted to keep their son's routine as normal as possible, so they continued sending him to pre-K. They informed the school about the fire, but the school didn't adjust the approach for the fire drill. The parent was not only upset about the drill but also about the school not being proactive in addressing their specific situation.\n\nFrom the school's side, they have a standard procedure with fire drills, which are important for safety. They might have followed the calendar as usual, assuming that all children would handle it the same way. The director said it was on the calendar, implying that it's a regular part of their program. The parent didn't check the calendar upon drop-off, which the school might consider a point against them. However, the school did know about the child's situation, as the parent had previously informed them.\n\nThe key points here are whether the school failed in their duty to accommodate a child with a traumatic experience and whether the parent overreacted. Fire drills are necessary for safety, but they should consider the well-being of children who might be particularly affected by such simulations. The school's response seems dismissive, especially since they were already aware of the child's recent trauma. The director didn't make an exception, which could be seen as uncompassionate or negligent.\n\nThe parent, on the other hand, was under a lot of stress, and their son was going through a tough time. Their reaction might have been intense, but the school's failure to adapt to the child's needs is a valid concern. The parent did inform the school of the situation, so the school had a responsibility to adjust their approach. The parent's anger might be justified given the circumstances, even if their method of expressing it was harsh.\n\nSo, considering all that, the school's actions might be the main issue here. The parent's outburst could be a result of stress and the school's inconsiderate approach. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong if the school failed to accommodate their child's needs. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the school's actions were the primary problem.\n"
