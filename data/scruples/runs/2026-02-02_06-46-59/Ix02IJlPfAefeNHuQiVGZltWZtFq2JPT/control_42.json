I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of a Reddit post is in the wrong for being angry at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. The setup is that the family had a house fire two days before, and the son, who just turned three, was upset during a fire drill because he thought his family was missing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from all angles. The parents wanted to keep their son's routine as normal as possible after the traumatic event, so they continued sending him to pre-K. The school did a fire drill, which wasn't communicated to the parents when they dropped him off. The author called the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar. The author was upset that the school didn't check in with them personally, even though they mentioned the situation the night before.\n\nNow, considering the school's responsibility. Pre-K teachers and staff are supposed to be aware of each child's needs and adjust activities when a child is going through trauma. A fire drill could be very stressful for a three-year-old who recently experienced a real fire. The school didn't seem to consider the child's emotional state or the recent family crisis. The director's response about the calendar being a communication tool isn't sufficient because the parents were in a vulnerable situation and may not have had the chance to check the calendar when dropping off the child. The school should have made a personal effort to inform the parents about the drill, especially given the context.\n\nThe parents had already communicated the house fire to the director the night before, so the school was aware of the situation. The director's job is to ensure staff are sensitive to such circumstances and adjust accordingly. By not informing the parents during drop-off, the school failed to provide the necessary support. The author's anger is understandable given the stress the child was under. While the author might have been harsh in their reaction, the school's actions were inconsiderate and unprofessional.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the school didn't take appropriate steps to accommodate the child's trauma and failed to communicate the fire drill effectively.\n"
