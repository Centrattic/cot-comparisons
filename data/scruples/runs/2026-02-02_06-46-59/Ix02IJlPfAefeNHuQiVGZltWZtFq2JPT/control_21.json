I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K after a fire drill incident. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe parent's 3-year-old had just gone through a house fire, which is a traumatic event. The family was displaced for six months, and they wanted to maintain some normalcy for the kids by continuing pre-K. The parent called the school to inform them about the fire, made sure the teacher knew, and left. The school then did a fire drill without warning the child, leading to a meltdown because the child didn't understand why his family didn't come out and was upset.\n\nThe school director justified it by saying it was on the calendar and that the child needed to get used to fire drills. The parent was angry and confronted the director, who didn't seem to consider the child's trauma or the specific circumstances. \n\nNow, was the parent in the wrong? Let's consider the school's responsibility. They should have been aware of the child's situation. The parent had informed them, so the school had a duty to accommodate. Fire drills are standard, but a 3-year-old who recently experienced a real fire might be especially vulnerable. The school's failure to adjust the drill for this child's emotional state seems negligent. The parent's reaction, while perhaps harsh, was in response to the school's oversight. The director's excuse about the calendar doesn't address the child's trauma. \n\nThe parent was trying to maintain normalcy, and the school's action disrupted that. The parent's anger is understandable given the context. The school should have been more sensitive. So, the parent is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
