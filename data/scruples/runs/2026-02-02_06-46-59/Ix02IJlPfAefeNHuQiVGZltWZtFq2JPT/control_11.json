I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for getting angry at their child's preschool after a fire drill.\n\nFirst, the context: The parents had a house fire and were dealing with a lot of stress. They wanted to keep their child's routine as normal as possible. The pre-K program was important for him, so they continued sending him even after the fire. The mom informed the director about the situation, but when she dropped him off, she didn't check the calendar that had the fire drill scheduled. The school did the drill without considering the child's trauma from the recent fire and didn't inform the parents when they arrived. The teacher's response was that it was on the calendar, but they didn't mention it when the parents dropped off the child. The mom was upset and yelled at the director.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The parents were very clear about the situation with the fire, and the school had a duty of care to the child. The fire drill could be traumatic, especially given the child's recent experience. The school didn't check in with the parents after they were informed, which is a failure in communication. The director's response about the calendar being the reason seems dismissive. The child was only 3, so expecting him to handle a fire drill without preparation or support is unreasonable. The mom's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is understandable given the circumstances. The school's actions were negligent in not considering the child's emotional state and not informing the parents about the drill despite their prior communication. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
