I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a parent who got angry at their son's pre-K school because they did a fire drill without warning the kid, who had just been through a house fire. The parent called the director out for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The kid just turned 3 and had a traumatic house fire. The parent was trying to keep his routine normal by sending him to school. The school did a fire drill as per their calendar, but didn't inform the parent about the situation of the child. The parent was upset because the drill might have triggered the child's trauma. The director's response was that it was on the calendar and they thought the kid was ready.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: They did inform the school about the fire, but maybe didn't check the calendar. The school didn't make any exceptions despite knowing the child's recent trauma. The parent lost their temper but was reacting to a situation that could have been avoided if the school had communicated better. \n\nThe parent's right to be upset is valid because the school didn't consider the child's specific circumstances. The director's reasoning seems insensitive. The parent's anger is a reaction to a lack of empathy and communication from the school. So, while the parent's reaction might have been harsh, the school's actions were inconsiderate. Therefore, the parent isn't really in the wrong because the school failed in their responsibility to accommodate the child's needs. The answer would be B (No).\n"
