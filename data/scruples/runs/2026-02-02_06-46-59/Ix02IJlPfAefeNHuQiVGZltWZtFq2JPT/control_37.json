I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The family had a house fire two days before the son's first day at pre-K where he was allowed to go alone. The parents wanted to keep things normal for the kids. The mom called the director to inform them ahead of time. When she dropped off the kid, she didn't check the calendar because she was busy buying clothes. The school did a fire drill without warning the child, leading to a meltdown. The director's reasoning was that it's on the calendar, but the parents weren't informed when dropping off. The mom gets angry and confronts the director, the user is questioning if she was wrong to do so.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the parents' actions. They had a recent traumatic experience with a fire, which is a serious event. The school had a fire drill scheduled, which is standard practice, but in this case, the school didn't check in with the parents during drop-off. The mom had already informed the director, so the school was aware of the situation. The director's response of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive. The parents' child was three years old, so not developmentally ready to understand fire drills without preparation. The school's failure to communicate, even after being informed, led to the child's distress. \n\nSo the parents wanted to keep the kid's routine normal, but the school's actions caused unnecessary anxiety. The mom's reaction, while maybe harsh, was in response to the school not following up when they should have, especially knowing the family's recent trauma. The school's responsibility is to ensure the safety and well-being of the children, which includes being sensitive to their circumstances. The director's lack of communication seems negligent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the school's actions were at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
