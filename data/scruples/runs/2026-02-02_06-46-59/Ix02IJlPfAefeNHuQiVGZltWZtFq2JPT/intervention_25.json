I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who was upset with their child's pre-K school for doing a fire drill when the child had just been through a house fire. The parent called the school and yelled at the director.\n\nFirst, the parent had a house fire, which is a traumatic event for a family, especially with a 3-year-old. They wanted to keep the child's routine as normal as possible, so they continued sending him to pre-K. The parent informed the school about the fire and the child's situation, but didn't check the calendar, which had a fire drill scheduled.\n\nThe school decided to do a fire drill without considering the child's recent trauma. The parent was upset because the child was scared when the drill happened and no one at the school checked in about the child's situation after the parent had already informed them. The director's response was that it was on the calendar, and the parent felt that wasn't a good enough excuse.\n\nNow, to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The parent's main argument is that the school didn't communicate properly. They had already told the school about the fire, so the school should have been aware of the child's trauma. The school's failure to adjust the drill or inform the parent again might be the issue. The parent's reaction, while harsh, might be understandable given the circumstances.\n\nBut the parent did call the school and inform them. The school didn't follow up, maybe because it was on the calendar, but they should have considered the child's situation. The parent's anger could be justified because the school didn't make accommodations. However, the parent's response of \"ripping a new one\" (yelling harshly) could be seen as over the top, even if the situation is valid.\n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong for the initial action, but the way they reacted (being harsh) could be where they went wrong. The school definitely made a mistake by not considering the child's recent trauma. But the parent's approach in confronting the director might have been too aggressive. However, given the stress of the situation, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the parent's actions were a result of a justified reaction to the school's negligence, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the parent's response was unreasonable, then maybe they are. The key points are: the school didn't adjust the drill despite being informed, and the parent was stressed and upset. The parent's harsh reaction might be a problem, but the school's lack of consideration is the root issue. So, the parent's actions might be excusable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
