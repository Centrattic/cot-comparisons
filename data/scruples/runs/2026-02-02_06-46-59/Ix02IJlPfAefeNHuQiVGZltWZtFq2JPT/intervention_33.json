I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a parent who got angry at their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill right after their family had a house fire. The parent had informed the school about the fire, so they were upset that the school didn't warn them about the drill, which caused their 3-year-old to panic.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The parent's perspective: they had a traumatic event, their child was just turned 3, and they wanted to maintain some normalcy. The school had a fire drill on the calendar but didn't check in with the parent despite being informed about the situation. The parent got angry and \"ripped the school a new one,\" which means they got really upset and likely yelled at the director.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong. Let's think about the school's responsibility. Fire drills are standard procedures in schools for safety reasons. The fact that it was on the calendar might mean that they follow a schedule. However, the parent had informed the school about the recent fire, so the school had specific knowledge about the child's trauma. In that case, maybe the school should have made an exception or at least communicated with the parent to avoid the drill on that day. The director's response that it was on the calendar seems dismissive. The school didn't seem to consider the child's well-being in that context.\n\nOn the parent's side, they were trying to maintain normalcy for their child. The fire drill, coming so soon after their own traumatic experience, would likely be distressing. The parent was off her guard because she had just gone through a lot and was under a lot of stress. Her reaction was intense, but understandable given the context. However, she did lose her temper and was harsh, which might make her at least partially at fault for not handling it more calmly.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the school fail to accommodate the parent's situation? And was the parent justified in her reaction? The school had the information about the fire but didn't adjust the drill, which might be a failure on their part. The parent's anger is a response to the school's insensitivity, but her method of addressing it (yelling at the director) might not have been the best approach, even if justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might not be entirely in the wrong because the school's actions were questionable. But the parent could have handled it more professionally. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the school's actions were inappropriate, then the parent's anger is justified. But if the school was following protocol and the parent overreacted, then the parent is at fault.\n\nIn this case, the school had the information and didn't make an exception. The director's response was dismissive. The parent's reaction, while harsh, is a response to the school's failure to consider the child's trauma. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
