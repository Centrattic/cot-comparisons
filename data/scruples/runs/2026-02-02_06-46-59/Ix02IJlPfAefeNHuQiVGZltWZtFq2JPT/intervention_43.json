I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who was upset with their child's preschool for doing a fire drill when the family had just experienced a house fire. The parent called the director to inform them about the fire, dropped the kid off, and then the school proceeded with a fire drill that caused the child to panic. The parent confronted the director, got angry, and now is asking if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They had a traumatic experience with a house fire and wanted to maintain some normalcy for their child. They informed the school about the situation when dropping off the child. The school, however, decided to conduct a fire drill without considering the child's recent trauma. The parent was upset because the school didn't mention the fire drill during drop-off even though it was on the calendar. The director's justification was that the child needed to get used to fire drills, which seems insensitive given the context.\n\nNow, evaluating the parent's reaction. They were angry, which is understandable given the circumstances. But the question is whether their anger and confrontation were justified. The parent admits they were harsh but feels justified. The school might have a policy of regular fire drills, which they probably think are necessary. However, the school didn't make an exception in this case, even after the parent had informed them of the recent trauma. The director's response that it was on the calendar doesn't address the emotional impact on the child or the parent's communication.\n\nSo, the parent's main issue is the school's lack of consideration and communication. The school might have been following protocol, but in a sensitive situation, they should have been more accommodating. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's failure to show empathy. Therefore, the parent's outburst might be seen as a result of frustration and concern for their child's well-being, not necessarily being in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the school might argue that fire drills are mandatory and they can't accommodate every individual situation. But given that the parent had explicitly informed them of the situation, the school should have taken that into account. The director's response that \"it was on the calendar\" suggests a lack of attention to the specific circumstances of the child. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's reaction seems justified because the school didn't take the necessary steps to prevent retraumatizing the child. The parent isn't in the wrong for being upset about their child's emotional well-being. The school's actions, while perhaps following standard procedures, were insensitive and caused unnecessary distress. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
