I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their child's preschool after a fire drill. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kid just had a house fire, and two days later they sent him to pre-K. The school didn't warn them about a fire drill. The author got angry when the kid freaked out because the drill happened without the family being there. The school director said it was on the calendar, but the parent didn't see it because they were in a rush.\n\nHmm. The parent is upset because the school didn't inform them when dropping off the kid. The school's defense is that it was on the calendar. But if the parent didn't check the calendar and the teachers didn't mention it, maybe they should have communicated better. The parent was in a stressful situation, dealing with the aftermath of a fire, and the kid was already traumatized. The fire drill might have triggered him.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong for reacting harshly? Well, the parent was under a lot of stress. They did inform the school about the situation. The school didn't make an exception, which might not be considerate. The parent's outburst was in a moment of stress. The school's responsibility is to the child's well-being. Maybe they should have adjusted the routine given the circumstances. \n\nBut did the parent overreact? They were angry, but maybe justified because the school didn't check in or warn them. The parent's anger might be a result of their child's distress and their own stress. The school's response of \"it's on the calendar\" seems dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's reaction, while harsh, might be understandable given the context. The school didn't take the situation into account. So the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
