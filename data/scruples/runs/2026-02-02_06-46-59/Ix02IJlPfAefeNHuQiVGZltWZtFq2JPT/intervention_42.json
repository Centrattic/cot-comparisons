I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for yelling at the pre-K school after a fire drill incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's son had just experienced a house fire, and they were trying to maintain normalcy by sending him to pre-K. The school did a fire drill without warning the child, who was upset because his family didn't come out. The author was angry and confronted the director, who said it was on the calendar. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to react that way.\n\nSo, the key points here: the child is 3 years old, recently traumatized by a house fire, and the school conducted a fire drill without prior communication. The school's defense was that it was on the calendar, but the author didn't check it. The author then got angry and confronted the director.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the school might have a policy of conducting fire drills regularly, which are important for safety. The calendar was there, so maybe they expected parents to be aware. However, the child had just been through a real fire, which could be traumatic. The school's failure to communicate this specific situation to the staff might be a problem. If the teacher didn't mention the fire when the parent dropped off the child, that's a lapse in communication. \n\nThe parent did inform the school about the fire, but maybe didn't explicitly mention the child's recent trauma. However, the director's response seems dismissive, focusing on the calendar rather than the child's well-being. The parent's reaction might be understandable given the context, but was it in the wrong? The parent was upset, but is yelling the appropriate way to handle it? Maybe they could have addressed it more calmly, but the school's actions might have been negligent in not making adjustments for the child's situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because the school failed to accommodate the child's recent trauma. The parent's reaction, while perhaps harsh, was in response to a situation that could have been handled more sensitively by the school. The school should have taken the child's situation into account and perhaps delayed the drill or communicated better with the parent. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
