I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who got angry with their preschool because the school conducted a fire drill with their 3-year-old son right after his family experienced a house fire. The parent is now wondering if they were right to confront the school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The child was three years old, which is very young. The family had just gone through a traumatic event\u2014a house fire. The parent wanted to keep things normal for the kids, so they sent them back to preschool. The school decided to do a fire drill without informing the parents, and the child got upset because he thought his family was in trouble. The parent was angry and confronted the school, and now they're asking if they were wrong to do so.\n\nThe parent's perspective is that the school didn't consider the recent trauma and didn't check in with them about the fire drill. The school's defense was that the fire drill was on the calendar and they didn't mention it because the parent didn't ask. The parent feels the school was negligent in not accommodating their specific situation.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the parent's side, they were trying to provide stability to their child after a traumatic event. The fire drill could have been a trigger for the child, especially since the family had just experienced a real fire. The school's responsibility is to ensure the safety of the children, which includes practicing fire drills. However, in this case, the school didn't take into account the child's recent trauma and the parent's situation. They should have been more communicative and sensitive to the family's needs.\n\nThe parent's reaction was to confront the school, which might have been harsh, but the situation is understandable given the context. The school's oversight in not informing the parent, especially after being aware of the situation, seems like a failure to provide adequate care. The parent's anger stems from protecting their child and being blindsided by the school's actions.\n\nSo, the school's actions were inappropriate. They should have checked in with the parent before conducting the drill, especially knowing the child's recent trauma. The parent's anger is justified because the school didn't communicate properly, leading to distress for the child. Therefore, the author (the parent) is not in the wrong. They had a valid reason to be upset, and the school failed in their duty to accommodate the family's situation.\n"
