I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent sending their 3-year-old to pre-K after a house fire. The school did a fire drill without warning the child, leading to the parent getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They informed the school about the fire and the child's situation. The parent was trying to keep the child's routine normal. The school had a calendar with activities, but the parent didn't check it. The school did a fire drill, which upset the child because he was confused when his family didn't come out. The director said it was on the calendar, but didn't mention it to the parent when they dropped off the child.\n\nThe parent got angry and confronted the director. The parent argues that a 3-year-old can't handle a fire drill without explanation. The director's response was to say it was on the calendar, but didn't communicate with the parent directly.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The parent did inform the school of the situation, so the school should have been aware. The school had a responsibility to inform the parent about the fire drill, especially given the recent trauma. The calendar might have been posted, but the school didn't check if the parent was aware. The parent didn't check the calendar, but they were preoccupied with the fire aftermath. The school should have ensured that the parent knew about the drill, especially considering the child's recent experience. The parent's anger is understandable given the circumstances, and the school failed to accommodate the child's needs. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong because the school didn't handle the situation properly.\n"
