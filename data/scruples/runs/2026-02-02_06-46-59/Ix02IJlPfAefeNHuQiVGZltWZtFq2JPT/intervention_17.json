I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is at fault for yelling at their son's preschool after a fire drill. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe parent sent their 3-year-old to pre-K two days a week after a house fire. The fire happened when the kid was 3, and they wanted to keep things normal for the kids. They called the director beforehand to inform them about the fire. Then, when dropping off, they didn't check the calendar, which had the fire drill scheduled. The school did a fire drill without warning the kid, leading to him being upset because his family wasn't there. The parent got angry at the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar. The parent then \"ripped her a new one\" and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: they just went through a traumatic house fire. Their kid was dealing with that trauma, and the school's fire drill might have triggered anxiety. The parent's main point is that a 3-year-old doesn't understand fire drills and couldn't comprehend why his family wasn't there. The school didn't mention the drill when the parent arrived, even though they were aware of the situation.\n\nFrom the school's side, they might follow strict protocols. Fire drills are part of safety procedures, and they might assume that if it's on the calendar, parents are aware. But in this case, the parent didn't check the calendar because they were preoccupied, and the school didn't proactively inform them when dropping off, despite being told about the family's situation.\n\nThe question is whether the parent was wrong to lose their temper. The parent was under a lot of stress from the fire and the aftermath, and their child was going through a traumatic time. The school's failure to communicate the fire drill despite knowing the parent's situation could be a factor. However, the parent didn't check the calendar either. But the school is responsible for the child's well-being; maybe they should have made an exception given the circumstances.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable because the child was upset, and the school didn't consider the recent trauma. The director's response about the calendar being there might be dismissive and not empathetic. The parent's reaction could be seen as a justified outburst given the context, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, the school's lack of communication is also a problem.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If the school failed to accommodate the child's needs and didn't communicate properly, the parent's anger is somewhat justified. But the parent didn't check the calendar either. However, the school is in a position of responsibility for the child's safety and emotional state. The parent's reaction might be harsh, but the school's actions contributed to the problem. Therefore, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong. So, answer B (the author is not in the wrong) might be appropriate here.\n"
