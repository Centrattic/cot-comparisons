I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for getting angry at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent's family had a house fire, and they were displaced for six months. They tried to keep their child's routine as normal as possible, so they continued sending him to pre-K. The child was just three years old. The parent called the school director to inform them about the fire, and the teacher was made aware when dropping off the kid. The parent didn't check the calendar, which had the fire drill scheduled. The school conducted a fire drill without warning the child, leading to him being upset because his family didn't come out during the drill. The parent got really angry at the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, should the parent be in the wrong here?\n\nLet me break it down. The parent's reasoning: the child just went through a traumatic experience (house fire), and the school decided to do a fire drill without considering the child's emotional state. The parent informed the school about the situation, and the school didn't seem to take that into account. The parent's reaction was emotional, but maybe justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe school's side: Fire drills are part of the curriculum and are on the calendar. The director might believe that it's necessary for the children to learn about safety procedures, regardless of individual circumstances. However, the parent had informed them about the fire, so maybe the school should have made an exception. The director didn't communicate the schedule properly to the parent, which is a problem.\n\nThe key points are: Did the school handle the situation appropriately? Should they have modified the fire drill for a child who had recent trauma? Did the parent have a right to be upset? Also, the parent didn't check the calendar, but they had already informed the school about the situation. The school's failure to communicate or accommodate might be at fault here.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable. The child was upset, and the school didn't consider the recent trauma. The director's response about the calendar seems dismissive. The parent was trying to maintain normalcy, and the school's action disrupted that. However, the parent could have checked the calendar themselves, but since they had already communicated the situation, maybe that's not the parent's fault. \n\nIn terms of blame, the school might be more at fault for not accommodating a child with a recent traumatic experience. Fire drills are important, but there should be some flexibility. The parent's outburst might have been harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to a situation where the school didn't show empathy or proper communication. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were angry, which is a human reaction, but maybe they overreacted. However, the school's actions could be seen as negligent. The parent might not be in the wrong because the school didn't handle the situation sensitively. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
