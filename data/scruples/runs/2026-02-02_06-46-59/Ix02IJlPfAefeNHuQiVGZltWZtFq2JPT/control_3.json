I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their child's preschool after a fire drill caused the kid to freak out. The situation involved a recent house fire, and the school did a fire drill without informing the parents, leading to the child being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The parent's perspective: they had a traumatic house fire, and just two days later, they sent their 3-year-old back to preschool to maintain some normalcy. They informed the school director about the incident and the child's attendance. However, the teacher didn't mention the fire drill when the parent dropped the kid off. The school decided to do a fire drill without considering the child's recent trauma, and the parent got upset when the child was distressed.\n\nThe school's perspective: They had a calendar that listed the fire drill for the day. The parent didn't check the calendar, so maybe they should have known. The director's response was that the child needed to be prepared for fire drills. But the parent argues that a 3-year-old doesn't have the mental capacity to understand such a drill, especially after a real fire.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the school have an obligation to inform the parent about the fire drill, especially after the parent mentioned the child's recent trauma? Did the parent have a right to be upset about the school's lack of communication? And was the parent justified in their reaction?\n\nThe school's policy about checking the calendar might be standard, but in this case, the parent had specifically informed the director about the situation. The director might be responsible for ensuring that staff are aware of any special circumstances and adjust accordingly. The teacher didn't mention the drill, which could indicate poor communication within the school. The parent's reaction might be understandable given the context\u2014trying to protect their child from re-traumatization. The director's justification of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive and possibly insensitive to the parent's situation.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's anger is likely justified. The school staff should have taken into account the child's recent trauma and adjusted the fire drill approach, perhaps by informing the parent not to do it in the child's presence or to handle it differently. The parent's outburst might have been harsh, but the root cause is the school's failure to accommodate a known sensitive situation. Therefore, the parent is not in the wrong here.\n"
