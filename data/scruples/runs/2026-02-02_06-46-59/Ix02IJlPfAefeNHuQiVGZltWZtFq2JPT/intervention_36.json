I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. \n\nFirst, the context: The child recently experienced a house fire and was in a stressful situation. The parents wanted to maintain normalcy by sending him to school. The school did a fire drill without informing the parents, and the child got upset because he didn't expect it and his family wasn't there. The parent was angry and confronted the director.\n\nSo, the key points here. The school's actions: conducting a fire drill without prior notice to the parents, especially given the recent trauma. Fire drills are standard, but in this case, the school had information about the family's situation from the parent's call the night before. The director mentioned it was on the calendar, implying it was public knowledge, but the parents weren't specifically warned when dropping off the child. That's a problem because even if it's on the calendar, the school should have made an exception given the circumstances. \n\nThe parent's reaction: they were upset and confrontational. But considering the child's trauma and the lack of communication from the school, their anger is understandable. The school's failure to accommodate a special situation might be the bigger issue here. \n\nThe question is about whether the parent is in the wrong. If the school didn't communicate properly despite knowing the family's situation, the parent's outburst might be justified. However, the parent did approach the situation angrily, which could be seen as excessive even if the school was at fault. \n\nBut in terms of who is \"in the wrong,\" the school's negligence in not making an exception for the child's emotional state and not informing the parents upon drop-off seems like the main issue. The parent's reaction, while harsh, is a response to that negligence. So the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong; the school's actions (or inactions) contributed significantly to the problem. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
