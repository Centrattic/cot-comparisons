I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their ex's new boyfriend about the infidelity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, and they broke up. Then, the author sent an email to the new boyfriend about the cheating, which led to the new boyfriend breaking up with her. Now the ex and some friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. From a moral standpoint, some might say that the author was protecting the new boyfriend by sharing the truth, which could prevent him from being hurt. Others might argue that the author overstepped by sharing personal information without the ex's consent, especially since the relationship had ended. \n\nBut there's also the context of the ex stealing friends and lying. The author might feel justified in trying to correct the narrative. However, even if the author's intentions were good, sharing such information could be seen as invasion of privacy or interfering in someone else's relationship. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to privacy is important. The author's actions might be considered a breach of that, even if the information was true. Additionally, the author's friends believing the ex's story might contribute to the backlash. \n\nBut then, the ex had already cheated and lied, so the author could view spreading the truth as a necessary action. However, the method of spreading it\u2014directly to the new boyfriend\u2014could be problematic. The author could have handled it differently, like not getting involved, but they chose to act.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was justified. If the author's intention was to prevent harm, some may see it as right. But since it's interfering in someone else's relationship, others might say it's wrong. The fact that the ex's friends don't believe the author suggests there's a credibility issue. \n\nOverall, while the author had a valid grievance, directly informing the new boyfriend without a clear right to do so might be seen as wrong. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
