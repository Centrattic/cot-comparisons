      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The writer found out through a friend, confronted the ex, and they broke up. The breakup wasn't pretty because the ex lied to friends and took them over. Five months later, the writer hears the ex has a new boyfriend. The writer contacts this new BF with an email about the cheating, leading to the BF breaking up with the ex. Now, the ex and her friends (some of the writer's ex-friends) are calling the writer an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy, boundaries, and revenge. The writer's action involves sharing personal information that's not publicly known. Even though the writer might believe they're doing the right thing by informing the new BF, it's a sensitive situation. \n\nIn relationships, people often have the right to privacy. The writer wasn't in a position to expose the ex's past to someone new. Even if the writer had their own reasons (like wanting to protect the new BF), it's usually up to the person involved to disclose that information themselves. The writer might have crossed a line by intervening instead of letting the new BF discover the truth on his own terms, if at all.\n\nAlso, the fact that the writer's ex-friends don't believe them and side with the ex suggests there's a credibility issue. The writer's actions could have been seen as vengeful, especially since the outcome was the ex losing her new relationship. This might have been more about getting back at the ex than protecting the BF.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might argue that they were being honest and that they would appreciate knowing their partner had a cheating history. But even then, sharing such information without consent can be problematic. The BF might have been better off finding out from the ex herself, not a third party. The writer's actions could have damaged multiple relationships and caused unnecessary harm.\n\nSo considering all this, the writer likely overstepped their bounds. They had no right to share the ex's past with someone else, regardless of their intentions. The situation points to the writer being in the wrong because they violated privacy and potentially acted out of spite rather than genuine concern for the BF.\n"
