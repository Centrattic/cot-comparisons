I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and the ex took the author's friends. Now, the ex has a new boyfriend, and the author sent him an email telling him about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of that, and now the author is getting called an asshole by their ex-friends who believe the ex's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author had the right to tell the new boyfriend. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their partner had cheated before. But does that justify disclosing the information? Maybe the author felt wronged, but sharing private information about an ex can be problematic. The ex and the author are no longer in a relationship, so maybe the author crossed a boundary by contacting the new partner directly.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the ex lied and stole friends. That's definitely hurtful, but does it give the author the right to retaliate by revealing the cheating? The new boyfriend might have a right to know, but the way the author went about it\u2014without the ex's consent\u2014could be seen as interfering in the new relationship. \n\nThen there's the fact that the author's ex-friends believe the ex's side because the author told them. That might have contributed to the friends' current stance against the author. The author might be trying to even the score, but sharing private matters can backfire and damage one's reputation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. However, the appropriate way would be for the new boyfriend to ask the ex directly, not for the ex's ex to disclose it. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it seems like the author acted out of anger and a desire for revenge, not just protection of the new boyfriend. This could be seen as a violation of privacy and meddling in someone else's relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
