I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author's ex cheated on him with a gym buddy, which he found out about through a friend. They had a messy breakup, and the ex stole some of the author's friends. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the author emailed the new boyfriend to tell him about the cheating. The new guy broke up with the ex because of this, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole. The author's friends don't believe his side of the story.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, consider the author's actions. He told the ex's new boyfriend about the infidelity. Even though he might have felt it was important for the new guy to know, the ex is no longer his partner. So, sharing that information might be a breach of privacy. Also, by doing this, he's interfering in someone else's relationship. \n\nThe consequences were that the new boyfriend broke up with her, and the author is now getting backlash. The ex's friends don't believe the author's version, which complicates things further. \n\nOn one hand, the author had valid reasons\u2014his ex cheated, and he wanted to protect the new guy. But on the other hand, he didn't have the right to share that information without her consent. Even if he had good intentions, the action itself is ethically questionable. People usually expect confidentiality after a breakup unless there's a shared responsibility, but in this case, it's the author's ex, so the new partner isn't his responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends believe the ex's side. That might be because the author told them, but if he's sharing private information to influence their opinions, that's not fair either. However, the main issue is contacting the new boyfriend directly. \n\nIn many cases, sharing ex's infidelity with a new partner is seen as crossing a line. It's not the new partner's business unless the ex is transparent herself. The author took it upon himself to inform the new guy, which could be seen as meddling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he shared private information about his ex without her consent and without the new partner's right to know directly from her. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
