I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The situation is that the ex cheated during the relationship, and the author found out through a friend. After breaking up, the ex started dating someone new, and the author emailed the new boyfriend with the cheating story. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and now the author is being called an asshole by the ex and her friends, who believe her version.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down. The author's reasoning was that they wanted the new boyfriend to know the truth, similar to how they would want to know if their partner had cheated. But the action here was sharing personal, potentially private information with someone else. \n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, there's no mention of any threats or illegal activity. However, ethically, it's more complicated. The author is disclosing confidential information about their ex. Even though the ex cheated, which is a valid reason for the breakup, sharing that information with a third party (the new boyfriend) could be seen as violating the ex's privacy. The author might have felt justified, but the act of sharing it without consent could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the author's friends are now on the ex's side, possibly because they don't know the full story. The author's action might have damaged relationships further, leading to isolation. The ex's friends trusting her could be because they weren't told the whole truth, but the author's method of sharing might have been confrontational or not well-received. \n\nAnother angle is the author's intention. They wanted to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on, which is a noble intent. However, the method of communication\u2014emailing the new boyfriend directly\u2014might have been inappropriate. It's possible the author could have approached the ex to discuss it with her first or sought counseling, but instead chose to reach out to the new boyfriend directly. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, depending on cultural or personal values, some might see the author as doing a good deed by preventing the new boyfriend from being hurt. Others might see it as an invasion of privacy and interference in the ex's new relationship. \n\nThe key point here is the lack of consent from the ex regarding sharing the information. Even if the information is true, the act of sharing it without the ex's consent could be considered a breach of confidentiality. Relationships are personal, and while cheating is a serious issue, the way information is shared can affect others' rights to privacy. \n\nAdditionally, the author's action might have caused emotional harm to the new boyfriend, who then broke up with the ex. The author may not have considered the other person's right to hear the information directly from their partner, rather than through a third party. \n\nSo, weighing the intent against the method and consequences, it's possible the author is in the wrong because they shared personal information without consent, even if their intent was to protect someone else. The right approach might have been to handle it privately with the ex or through other means that respect everyone's privacy.\n"
