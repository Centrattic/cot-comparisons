It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex started dating a new guy. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend explaining that the ex cheated, leading to the new guy breaking up with her. The ex and their mutual friends are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is essentially exposing their ex's infidelity to her new partner. Did they have the right to do that? Well, in some contexts, people might argue that the new boyfriend has a right to know about his partner's past if it affects their current relationship. But how does the method of disclosure play into this?\n\nThe author didn't go through the ex to inform the new BF; they went directly to him. That could be seen as interfering in the new BF's relationship without the ex's consent. Even if the author had valid reasons, like wanting the new BF to be aware of the ex's behavior, bypassing the ex might be considered inappropriate. \n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The new BF did break up with the ex because of the information the author provided. The ex and her friends are upset because they believe the author spread false information. But the author claims it's true. However, the mutual friends don't believe the author's version of events. That raises a question about whether the author's actions were justified in spreading the information, even if true.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's motivation. They mention that they would want to know if their new partner cheated. That's a reasonable sentiment, but does that justify the action? Maybe not, because the author is inserting themselves into a new relationship that's not theirs. \n\nLegally, in some places, spreading information about someone's past infidelity isn't a criminal act, but ethically, it's questionable. The author didn't go through proper channels, like sharing the information with the new BF in a respectful or private manner, but instead sent an email. The method could be seen as passive-aggressive or interfering.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be seen as crossing a boundary by revealing the ex's cheating to her new partner without her consent. Even if the information is true, the way it was disclosed could be considered meddling. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). But if someone believes that the new BF had a right to know, then maybe not (B). But the main issue is the method and the author's right to disclose it without the ex's permission.\n"
