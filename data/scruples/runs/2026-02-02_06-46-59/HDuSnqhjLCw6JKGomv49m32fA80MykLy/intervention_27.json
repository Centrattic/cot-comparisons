I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, and he found out through a friend. He confronted her, she confessed, and they broke up. Now, five months later, he finds out she's dating a new guy. He sends an email to the new boyfriend telling him about the cheating. The new guy breaks up with her because of this, and now the ex and her friends (who were the author's ex-friends) are calling him an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the main question is: Did the author do the right thing by telling the new boyfriend? Let me think about the ethics here. On one hand, the author might believe he was protecting the new guy from being cheated on again. That's a common justification for exposing someone's past behavior. But then again, the author is sharing private information that could damage someone else's relationship. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent can be seen as a breach of privacy.\n\nAlso, the breakup was already five months ago, so maybe there's some time passed, but the author is still involved in the ex's new relationship. There's a line between being concerned and overstepping. The ex has moved on, and by contacting the new partner, the author might be acting out of spite or trying to get even, especially since the ex took his friends. The fact that the ex's friends believe her and not the author might indicate that the author's actions could be seen as vindictive rather than helpful.\n\nAnother angle: if the new boyfriend had asked the ex about her past, she might have had the chance to tell him. But the author didn't give her a chance to disclose it; he just told him directly. That could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. Even if the information is true, the method of disclosure is questionable. The author could have chosen other ways to protect himself, like blocking the ex or moving on, instead of inserting himself into her new relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to the new boyfriend breaking up with her. The ex is now upset, and the friends are taking her side. This suggests that the community or social circle might view the author's actions as crossing a line. Even if the ex was at fault for cheating, spreading that information to a new partner might not be justified.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author is sharing private information that affects someone else's relationship without the consent of the person involved (the ex). Even if the intent was to protect the new guy, the method is problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
