I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the ex cheated, they broke up, and now the person is contacting the new boyfriend with that information. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The person says they wanted to protect the new BF by informing him about the cheating. On one hand, they might think they're doing the right thing by being honest so he can make an informed decision. On the other hand, they didn't get the ex's permission to share this, and it's possible the ex's side of the story isn't known.\n\nThe ex's new BF broke up with her after finding out. The user's ex is now being called an asshole by her and mutual friends, but the user's friends who heard the cheating story are siding with the ex. That's a problem because the user's friends don't know the whole story.\n\nLegally, there's not much here unless there's harassment or defamation, which doesn't seem to be the case. But morally, it's tricky. The user might believe they're justified because the ex was dishonest, but spreading information about someone's past can be seen as invasion of privacy or betrayal.\n\nAlso, the user didn't confront the ex's new BF directly; they used an email. That might be seen as passive-aggressive or not the right approach. The ex might feel that the user is interfering in her new relationship, which is inappropriate.\n\nSo, the user has valid reasons for feeling wronged, but the way they handled it could be considered overstepping. The right approach might have been to move on and not involve the new BF unless directly asked. By sharing the info, the user caused a breakup and conflict. So, while the user has grounds for their anger, their actions might be seen as wrong because they didn't respect the new BF's right to hear from the ex directly, and they might have spread unverified information.\n"
