I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated on them. The ex cheated, they found out, broke up, and then later told the new boyfriend, leading to the breakup. Now their ex and the ex's friends are calling them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's reasoning is that they wanted the new boyfriend to know the truth because they would want that information if they were in the same position. But did they overstep?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless there's a non-disclosure agreement, the author isn't breaking any laws. But ethically, it's more complicated. The author had a personal vendetta and used the new boyfriend's information to share something that might be sensitive. They didn't confront the ex directly first, but went straight to the new partner. This could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship, which is generally frowned upon, even if the information is true.\n\nThe ex's side is that she moved on and started a new relationship. The author's action might have caused unnecessary harm. Even though the ex cheated, the author's method of sharing the information could be considered vindictive rather than constructive. The fact that the ex's friends don't believe the author suggests there's a credibility issue, possibly because the author didn't handle it more carefully or through appropriate channels.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt betrayed and wanted to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. But the way they did it was aggressive and possibly invasive. There's a line between protecting someone and invading someone else's privacy. The email was unsolicited and could be seen as a breach of privacy for the ex, even if the ex had done something wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might have had a valid reason, but their actions crossed into the new relationship's space without consent. Ethically, it's questionable. People usually expect that past relationships stay in the past unless there's a direct risk to the new partner. The author didn't approach the ex first to address any lingering issues or seek closure, which might have been a better approach. Instead, they took it upon themselves to inform the new boyfriend, which led to the breakup. While the ex was at fault for cheating, the author's method of retaliation might not be justified.\n\nIn many cases, spreading information about someone's past, even if true, can be seen as harmful and disrespectful. The author's action could be considered a form of revenge rather than a genuine effort to protect the new boyfriend. The result was that the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, which might have been the author's intention, but using such a direct and invasive method is problematic.\n\nTherefore, while the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response might not be entirely justified. The author is likely in the wrong because they took it upon themselves to interfere in a new relationship without considering the consequences or respecting boundaries.\n"
