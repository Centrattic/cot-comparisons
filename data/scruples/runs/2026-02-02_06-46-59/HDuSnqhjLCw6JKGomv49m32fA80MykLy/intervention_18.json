I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author found out their ex cheated through a friend, confronted her, and they broke up. Then, five months later, the ex started dating someone new. The author sent the new boyfriend an email about the cheating. The new guy broke up with her, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole. The author's friends who were stolen don't believe the author's side.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. So, what are the key points here? The author had valid reasons to be upset about the cheating. They wanted the new boyfriend to know the truth. But is it ethical to contact someone's new partner about past issues? \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified in wanting the new boyfriend to know, thinking it's the right thing to do. On the other hand, sharing such information could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. The author isn't part of their current relationship, so maybe they overstepped by contacting the new boyfriend directly. \n\nAlso, the author's actions led to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex, which might have been a consequence they wanted but could be seen as meddling. The ex's friends not believing the author suggests a breakdown in trust, but that's more of a result of the situation rather than the decision to tell the new boyfriend.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? It's possible the author had good intentions but took the wrong approach. Perhaps they should have let the ex handle it herself or focused on their own healing instead of interfering. However, the information they shared was true, so maybe the intent was to protect the new boyfriend. \n\nBut generally, people often advise against contacting someone's new partner with past issues unless it's a legal matter or something very serious. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the ex's privacy and moving on. \n\nAlternatively, if they had a legitimate concern that the new partner might be hurt, maybe they weren't entirely wrong. However, the method of contacting the new partner directly without the ex's consent is questionable. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is that the author is in the wrong. They should have focused on their own recovery rather than intervening in the ex's new relationship. The action might have been well-intentioned but ethically questionable. So, answer A.\n"
