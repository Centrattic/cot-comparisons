I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if the author did the right thing by telling their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. The author's ex cheated on them, and after the breakup, they sent an email to the new boyfriend revealing the infidelity. The new boyfriend then broke up with the ex, and now the author is getting criticized for it.\n\nHmm, first, the author has a valid reason because the ex cheated. They were in a 3-year relationship, and the infidelity was significant. But the question is whether telling the new boyfriend was the right move. On one hand, the author might feel that the new boyfriend should know the truth to avoid being hurt. On the other hand, the author isn't the ex's boyfriend's parent or authority figure; maybe the ex had the responsibility to disclose that herself.\n\nThe author didn't go through the ex to tell the new boyfriend, which could be seen as interfering. Even if the author's intention was good\u2014to protect the new guy\u2014it's possible that the ex should have been the one to share her past. Also, the author's motivation might be to get even or make the ex look bad, especially since the ex took friends and there's some bitterness involved. That could cloud their judgment.\n\nBut then again, if the author believes that honesty is important and they would want to know if their partner had a cheater in their past, maybe they have a point. However, the method of disclosure matters. Instead of directly contacting the new boyfriend, maybe the author should have focused on their own healing and not meddle in the ex's new relationship.\n\nThe consequences are that the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, which might be good for him, but it could also be seen as the author causing unnecessary harm. The ex's friends are siding with her, possibly because they don't know the full story. The author might have a valid reason, but the action of contacting the new boyfriend without consent or through proper channels is problematic. It's about respecting privacy and boundaries. So, even if the intention was good, the approach was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
