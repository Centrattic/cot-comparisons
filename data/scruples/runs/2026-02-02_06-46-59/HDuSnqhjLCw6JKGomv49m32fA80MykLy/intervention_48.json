I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex telling the new boyfriend that the ex cheated. The ex found out through a friend that the ex was cheating, confronted her, they broke up, and then the author emailed the new BF to tell him about the cheating. The new BF broke up with the ex, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's the case. Let's break it down. First, the author's actions: sharing information about the ex's infidelity with the new BF. The key points here are whether the author had a right to do that and if it was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they wanted the new BF to know the truth, similar to how they would want to know if their partner had cheated. But on the other hand, after a breakup, people are supposed to move on and not interfere. The author is interfering by contacting the new partner directly, which could be seen as crossing a boundary. Also, even if the ex was cheating, the author might not have the right to share that information unless it's relevant. The new BF has the right to hear the story from the ex directly, not from an ex-partner. \n\nMoreover, the author's actions led to the new BF breaking things off, which could be considered meddling. Even if the information is true, the method of sharing it might be inappropriate. The author's motives might be vindictive or to get revenge for the ex stealing friends and lying. That could cloud their judgment. \n\nBut maybe the author's intention was to protect the new BF by sharing the truth. However, the ethical aspect here is about respecting boundaries. Once the relationship is over, the author's role is to not interfere. The ex's actions were wrong, but the author took it upon themselves to act as a judge and inform the new BF, which might not be their place. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, might be seen as overstepping. The answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they violated the new BF's right to hear the information directly from the ex, and they meddled in a new relationship without a legitimate right to do so.\n"
