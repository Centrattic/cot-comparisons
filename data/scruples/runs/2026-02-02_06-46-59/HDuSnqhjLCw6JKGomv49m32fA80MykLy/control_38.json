I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. \n\nFirst, the user's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The user found out through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. Then, five months later, the user told the new boyfriend via email about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex, and now people are calling the user an asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether the user did the right thing. On one hand, the user felt it was important for the new boyfriend to know the truth, as they would want to know if their partner had cheated before. But on the other hand, the user is being criticized for interfering, especially since the ex and her friends don't believe the user's side.\n\nI need to consider boundaries here. After a breakup, is it okay to contact the ex's new partner with private information? The user might think they're doing the right thing by being honest, but sharing someone's past behavior without their consent can be seen as crossing a line. Even if the user's intention was good, the act of contacting the new boyfriend directly could be considered invasion of privacy or betrayal. \n\nAlso, the consequences: the new relationship ended because of this disclosure. The ex and her friends are upset because they don't know the full story. The user's friends who were stolen might not have the full context. So, the user might have caused more harm by not giving the ex a chance to disclose it herself. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe the user should have approached the new boyfriend through the ex, but that's not how it happened. The user took direct action. Ethically, even with good intentions, sharing someone's secrets can be wrong. The user might be in the wrong because they shared personal information that wasn't their place to share, even if the information was true. \n\nBut some might argue that the user had a right to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. However, the user's method might not be the appropriate way to handle it. The key here is whether the user had the authority to disclose that information. Since it's about the ex's past, the user might not have the right to share it with the new partner without the ex's consent. \n\nSo, considering these points, the answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong. They crossed a boundary by sharing private information without the ex's consent, even if their intentions were good.\n"
