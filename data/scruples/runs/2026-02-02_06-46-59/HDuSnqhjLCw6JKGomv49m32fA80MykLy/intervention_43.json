I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's ex cheated, they broke up, and the ex then lied to friends and stole them. Now, the ex is dating someone new. The author found out through a friend and then emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The boyfriend broke up with the ex, and now the ex and the friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the ex actually cheat? Yes, according to the author. The author confronted her, she confessed, and they broke up. Then, the author told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The boyfriend ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. \n\nOn one hand, the author is sharing information that could protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. They might think they're doing the right thing by preventing the same thing from happening to someone else. On the other hand, the author is interfering in the new boyfriend's relationship without being asked. Even though the ex cheated, spreading that information could be seen as violating privacy or causing harm.\n\nBut wait, the author has first-hand knowledge. They were in a relationship and the ex cheated. The author's motivation is to protect the new boyfriend, which is understandable. However, the method of sharing that information\u2014without the ex's consent or the new boyfriend's request\u2014could be problematic. \n\nIs it ethical to tell someone about their partner's past infidelity without being asked? Some might argue that it's their duty to prevent harm, but others would say it's an invasion of privacy. Also, the author's ex is now being ostracized by people who believe her side, which complicates things. The author's actions led to the breakup, but maybe they felt justified in stopping another person from being hurt.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, there's no law against sharing such information unless it's defamation. However, the moral aspect is different. The author might have a valid reason, but the method and intent matter. If the new boyfriend had asked for the truth, the author might be in the right. But since they didn't ask, the author might have overstepped.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if their intention was good. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and many might say yes because they meddled in someone else's relationship without being asked.\n"
