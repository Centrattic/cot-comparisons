I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's ex cheated on them, and after the breakup, the ex started dating someone new. The author then emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result is the new boyfriend broke things off, and now the author is getting backlash from their ex and mutual friends.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author is sharing private information about their ex with her new partner. Even though the author believes it's important for the new BF to know, is it their place to do so? \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, cheating is a personal matter. The author might have valid reasons for wanting to protect the new BF from being cheated on again. But morally, sharing someone's past without their consent could be seen as invading privacy. Even if the ex was wrong, the author's method of handling it might be questionable. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's ex has taken sides with the mutual friends suggests that maybe the story isn't one-sided. Did the author act out of spite, or genuine concern? The email could be seen as a way to get revenge or sabotage the new relationship. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important, but the new BF would ideally ask the ex directly about her past. The author stepping in might prevent the ex from being honest herself. Additionally, the author's actions led to the breakup of the new relationship, which might cause pain to all involved. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be overstepping by sharing private information. They have a right to their experience, but sharing it with the new BF without the ex's consent could be considered wrong. The right approach might have been to let the new BF learn the truth through the ex's own honesty, not through the ex's ex.\n"
