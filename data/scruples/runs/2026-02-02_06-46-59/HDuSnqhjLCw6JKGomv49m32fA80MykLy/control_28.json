I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So the situation is that the ex cheated, they broke up, and then the person told the ex's new BF about it. The new BF ended it with the ex because of that info. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the person an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person's argument is that they would want to know if their partner cheated, so they shared the info. But did they have the right to do that? \n\nWell, in most cases, when a relationship ends, the people involved usually expect privacy. So the ex had a right to privacy, but she cheated. The person found out through a friend, confronted her, and they broke up. Then, the person went ahead and told her new BF. \n\nBut here's the thing: even though the ex cheated, sharing that information could be seen as crossing a line. The person isn't the new BF's parent or authority figure; their job isn't to protect the new BF. The new BF might have a right to know, but the person isn't in a position to decide that. \n\nAlso, the person might be acting out of revenge or to hurt the ex. If that's the case, it's not justified. Even if the person's intention was to protect the new BF, the method might still be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the person didn't go through the ex to tell the new BF, which might mean they didn't respect the ex's privacy after the breakup. Even if the ex was dishonest, the person's actions could be seen as violating the terms of the breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the person was being honest and transparent, doing what they think is right for the new BF's sake. But the problem is, the new BF might have chosen to date the ex knowing her past. The person's action could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong because they shared private information without the ex's consent, possibly out of spite or to get revenge. It's understandable to be hurt, but taking that out on the ex's new partner isn't the right approach. The answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
