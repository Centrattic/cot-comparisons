I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex cheated on them, they found out through a friend, confronted her, broke up, and now she's dating someone new. The author sent an email to the new BF explaining the cheating, which led to the new BF breaking up with her. Now the ex and some mutual friends are calling the author an asshole because they don't believe the author's side.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has a valid reason (the cheating), but they went to the new BF directly. Is that justified?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, maybe not, but morally? The author might feel they're protecting the new BF from being cheated on. But there are other ways to handle it, like letting the new BF find out on his own or not interfering. However, the author's action caused the breakup, which the ex is upset about. The author's friends also believe the ex, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even though the ex cheated, spreading that information without the ex's consent might be considered a breach of privacy. The author could have handled it differently, like moving on without intervening. But the ex's cheating is a valid reason to want to warn the new BF. However, the method of doing so might be seen as overstepping. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for taking that action. But some might argue they were protecting the new BF. It's a bit of a grey area.\n\nBut in most cases, intervening in an ex's new relationship like that is seen as meddling. So the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong. But I need to check the details again. The author says they would want to know if their partner cheated, so they acted based on that. But that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Privacy and respect for others' relationships are important factors here. The author's action, while motivated by a desire to warn the new BF, might not be the right approach. So the answer is A.\n"
