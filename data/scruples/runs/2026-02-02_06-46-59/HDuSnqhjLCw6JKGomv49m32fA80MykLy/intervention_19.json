I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex cheated on them, and the author told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The new BF broke up with her after finding out. Now the ex and her friends are upset and calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm, first, the author found out about the cheating through a friend. They confronted the ex, she confessed, and they broke up. Then, five months later, the author heard that the ex started dating someone new. The author sent an email to this new BF, telling him about the cheating. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner cheated on a previous partner.\n\nBut wait, is it okay to disclose someone else's cheating to a new partner without their consent? The ex is now in a new relationship, and the author shared private information. Even though the author was wronged, taking the information to the new BF might be considered crossing a boundary. The ex has a right to privacy, even if she was unfaithful. The author might have acted out of anger or a desire to prevent the new BF from being hurt, but is that justification enough?\n\nAlso, the author's friends are now siding with the ex, not knowing about the cheating. The author might feel vindicated, but sharing private information without consent can be seen as a violation of trust. In many cases, people are advised not to badmouth exes or share secrets without their knowledge, even if they feel justified. So, while the ex's actions were wrong, the author's method of addressing it could be problematic. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here because they took it upon themselves to inform the new BF, which isn't their place. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
