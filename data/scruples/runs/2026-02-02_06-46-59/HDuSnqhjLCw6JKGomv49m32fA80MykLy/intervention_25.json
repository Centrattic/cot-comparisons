      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and the ex stole some of the author's friends. Now, the ex is dating a new guy. The author emailed the new guy about the cheating, leading to the breakup. Now, the ex and the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author acted wrongly by informing the new boyfriend. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because they wanted the new boyfriend to know about the cheating, which is a valid concern. They might think it's right to prevent someone else from being hurt. But on the other hand, the author didn't have the ex's permission to share that information. The ex might have moved on and wanted to leave the past behind. The author also didn't have the new boyfriend's consent to contact him directly. \n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. Even if the cheating was a betrayal, sharing that information with the new partner might be seen as violating the ex's privacy. Also, the author's ex-friends are still on her side, suggesting that the author's actions might have been out of line, especially if the friends believe the ex's side of the story. \n\nAnother angle: the author's method of handling it\u2014using a friend to overhear, confronting the ex, and then taking matters into their own hands by contacting the new boyfriend directly. This could be seen as meddling in a new relationship and not respecting boundaries. \n\nBut maybe the author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend from being hurt again. However, the right way to handle it would be to let the new boyfriend find out naturally, not through a third party. The author might not have the authority to act as a gatekeeper for the ex's past. \n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that this action caused more conflict. The ex is now with someone else, and the author's actions led to a breakup, which might have been unnecessary. The author's friends are now on the ex's side, indicating that the author's approach was not well-received and possibly seen as vindictive. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the ex cheated, the author's response might be considered an overstep. It's one thing to move on from the relationship, but another to interfere in the ex's new relationship. The author's actions could be seen as a lack of maturity or closure, using this as a way to get back at the ex for stealing friends. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author likely overstepped their bounds by contacting the new boyfriend without the ex's consent. Even if the intention was good, the method was invasive and disrespectful of the ex's privacy and the new relationship's autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
