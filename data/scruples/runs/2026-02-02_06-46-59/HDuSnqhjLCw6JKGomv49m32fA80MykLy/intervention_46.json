I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the infidelity is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex cheated, they ended up in a messy breakup, and then the author told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to inform the new boyfriend so he'd know about the ex's past infidelity. That's understandable because if the author were in a similar situation, they'd want to know. But the question is whether it's right to do that after the relationship has ended.\n\nOne angle is that the author has a right to share their experience, especially if it's true. However, contacting someone's new partner without their consent might be considered an invasion of privacy. The author isn't the new boyfriend's friend, so they might be overstepping by sharing personal information about the ex. \n\nAnother point is the aftermath. The ex is now being criticized by her new partner for the cheating, which the author didn't know about. The author's ex and friends are upset, and the author's friends don't believe their side. This suggests that the author might have acted out of anger or a desire for revenge, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nAlso, the method of communication\u2014emailing the new boyfriend\u2014might not be appropriate. It's possible that the author should have handled this differently, maybe by focusing on their own closure instead of interfering with the ex's new relationship. \n\nBut then again, if someone is hiding infidelity, there's an argument that the new partner has a right to know. However, the author isn't in a position to enforce that, especially not after the breakup. The key here is whether the author had a right to disclose this information without consent. \n\nI think the consensus here would be that while the author had a valid grievance, the action of contacting the new boyfriend was inappropriate. They crossed a boundary by sharing personal information about their ex with someone else, which could be seen as meddling. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated privacy and likely acted out of spite rather than a noble cause.\n"
