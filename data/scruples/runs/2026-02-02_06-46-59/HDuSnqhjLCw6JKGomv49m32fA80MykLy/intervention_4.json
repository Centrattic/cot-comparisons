I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them, which is a major betrayal. The person found out through a friend and confronted their ex, leading to a breakup. Then, months later, they told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of that. Now the ex and mutual friends are calling the person an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are intent and right to privacy. The person's reasoning is that they wanted the new boyfriend to know the truth, similar to how they'd want to know if their partner had cheated. But did they have the right to share that information?\n\nGenerally, even if someone was wronged, spreading information about a past partner's infidelity to a new partner can be seen as crossing a line. It's a privacy issue. The ex is now the new boyfriend's partner, and sharing such information without consent might be considered interfering. However, the person's actions were motivated by their own hurt and a desire for honesty.\n\nBut in most cases, the act of informing someone else's partner about past infidelity without being asked is considered inappropriate. The person might have justified it by saying they wanted the new boyfriend to know, but it's still their ex's story to tell, not the ex's ex. The consequences are that the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, which could be seen as a direct result of the person's actions, leading to more conflict.\n\nSo, even though the person was hurt, the action of informing the new boyfriend was likely an overstep. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
