I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating.\n\nFirst, the person's ex cheated on them, which is a big deal. They found out through a friend, confronted the ex, and broke up. Then, after five months, they told the new boyfriend via email. The ex and her friends are now calling them an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether sharing that information was wrong. On one hand, the person might feel justified because they wanted the new boyfriend to know the truth, similar to how they would want to know if their partner had a history of cheating. But on the other hand, sharing someone's private information, even if it's true, can be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nThe ex-friends don't know the whole story and side with the ex, which complicates things. Also, the act of contacting the new boyfriend directly without the ex's consent could be seen as invasive. Even though the person had a valid reason, the method might not be the best. \n\nBut was the information false? No, the ex did cheat. However, the problem might be how it was shared. There's a difference between sharing with mutual friends versus directly contacting the new partner. The person might argue they were protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again, but others might see it as meddling in their ex's new relationship.\n\nConsidering all aspects, the person might be seen as crossing a boundary by sharing the information directly with the new boyfriend. Even if their intent was good, the action could be considered an invasion of privacy. So, the answer might be A, they're in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they disclosed private info without consent, even if true, it's likely A.\n"
