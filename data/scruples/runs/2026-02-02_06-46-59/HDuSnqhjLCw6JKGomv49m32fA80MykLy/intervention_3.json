I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by telling the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. So, the situation is that the author's ex cheated on them, they found out, broke up, and now the ex is with a new guy. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend revealing the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke up with her, and now the author is getting backlash from their ex's friends who believe the ex's version.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Telling someone about a past partner's infidelity without consent could be seen as a privacy violation. The author had a valid reason\u2014they wanted the new BF to know the truth. But was it their place to share that information? \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but the method of communication matters. The author didn't confront the ex first or seek legal advice. They went straight to the new BF, which might be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the author's intentions were good, sharing personal information about an ex without their permission can be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author's ex's friends are now against them because they believe the ex's side. That suggests the author's message might have been one-sided, possibly leading to misunderstandings. The ex could have her own narrative, and the author might not have provided the full context to the new BF. \n\nLegally, in many places, sharing private information without consent can lead to issues like defamation if it's not factual. But in this case, the cheating was confirmed by the author's friend and the ex herself. However, the method of disclosure is still questionable. \n\nEmotionally, the author might be seeking some form of justice or closure, but this action could be seen as retaliation. The break-up was already messy, and this act added more conflict. The author's friends are now aligned with the ex, indicating that the author's approach might have been counterproductive. \n\nSo, considering all these angles, the author probably acted in the wrong by sharing personal information without consent, even if the intent was to inform the new partner. The right approach might have been to let the ex handle her new relationship, unless there was a legal or safety concern. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
