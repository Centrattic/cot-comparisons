I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. \n\nFirst, the user's ex cheated with a gym buddy, which the user found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the user hears the ex is dating someone new. The user then emails the new BF about the cheating, leading to the BF breaking up with her. The ex and mutual friends are upset, but the user's side of the story isn't believed by the friends.\n\nHmm. So, is the user wrong here? Well, sharing someone else's personal information, especially about cheating, can be a privacy issue. Even if the user had a reason to want the new BF to know, did they have the right to disclose that without the ex's consent? \n\nThe user might think they're acting in the BF's best interest, wanting him to know the truth. But the ex might consider this betrayal, especially since they're no longer together. Also, the user's actions led to the BF breaking up with her, which could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the user's friends not believing them. That might be because the user told them the ex cheated, but the friends are siding with the ex. However, the user's friends might not have the full context either. \n\nLegally, there's probably no issue, but ethically, it's tricky. Even if the user felt wronged, sharing that information without the ex's consent could be seen as crossing a line. It's about respecting privacy and not meddling in another relationship. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user's action was a breach of the ex's privacy and could be seen as interfering, which makes them at fault. So the answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
