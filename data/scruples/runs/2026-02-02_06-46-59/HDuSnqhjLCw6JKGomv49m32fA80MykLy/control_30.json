I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them, which is a major betrayal. The person found out through a friend, confronted their ex, and ended the relationship. Then, after five months, they heard the ex started dating someone new. They emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating incident. The result was the new boyfriend broke up with her, and now the ex and her friends are calling the original person an asshole. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the person act in a way that's justified? They had valid reasons\u2014trying to prevent the new guy from being cheated on. But the method involved contacting the new boyfriend directly, which is a gray area. Legally, there's nothing illegal here, but ethically, it's questionable. The person might have a right to be upset, but using their own judgment to inform someone else's partner could be seen as interfering. \n\nHowever, the ex's actions were deceitful, and the person might feel justified in trying to protect the new boyfriend. On the other hand, the person could have approached it differently, like advising the new boyfriend to check with the ex himself instead of just telling him. Also, the ex's friends are siding with her, which complicates things. If the information is true and the person is acting out of genuine concern, it's a tough call. But intentionally sharing personal information about an ex's infidelity to a new partner is often considered a breach of privacy, even if the intent is good. So, depending on the cultural or social norms, the answer might differ. But generally, it's seen as overstepping. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
