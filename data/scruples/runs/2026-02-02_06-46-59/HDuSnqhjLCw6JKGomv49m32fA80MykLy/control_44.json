      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: the author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and the breakup wasn't pretty. The ex ended up stealing friends. Now, five months later, the ex started dating someone new. The author found out and sent an email to the new boyfriend explaining that the ex cheated. The new boyfriend broke things off, and now the ex and mutual friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about whether the author had the right to tell the new BF about the cheating. On one hand, the author might feel they were justified because they would want to know if their partner had cheated. But on the other hand, sharing someone's private information, even if it's true, could be seen as a violation of their privacy or spreading gossip. \n\nThe ex and author are no longer in a relationship, but the author is still contacting someone else (the new BF) about past infidelity. The author's intention was to protect the new BF from being cheated on, but by doing so, they might have overstepped. The ex's side is that the breakup was messy, and the friends are siding with the ex, possibly because the author's actions made the ex look bad or caused more conflict. \n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries here. Even if the author's story is true, sharing someone else's past in a personal way without their consent can be problematic. It's similar to spreading rumors. The new BF has a right to know about his partner's history, but the method of disclosure might not be appropriate. The author could have approached the BF directly to talk, but instead chose to email him, which might be seen as interfering. \n\nAlso, the author's ex friends believing her side suggests that there's a conflict in narratives. The author might be trying to set the record straight, but doing so in a way that's not constructive. The consequences are that the new BF broke up with the ex, which might have been the right thing for him, but the author's role in that could be seen as manipulative or vindictive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, generally, people are advised not to interfere in others' relationships, even if they have bad experiences. The author's actions might be seen as crossing a line by sharing private information that could damage another person's relationship. So, even if the author had good intentions, the action was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
