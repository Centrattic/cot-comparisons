It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on the author with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and the ex took the author's friends with her. Now, five months later, the ex is dating someone new. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend explaining the cheating, leading the new guy to break up with the ex. Now, the ex and the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole, even though the author's friends don't know the truth.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is sharing private information about their ex's infidelity with her new partner. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner cheated before. But is this justified?\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is not the one who cheated, but they are revealing personal information to someone else. Even if the ex was wrong, sharing that information with a third party could be seen as violating privacy. The ex might have moved on, and the new boyfriend has the right to learn the truth, but the method and the timing matter. \n\nAlso, the author's friends who are now on the ex's side might have been influenced by the ex's version of events. The author tried to tell their side but perhaps didn't do so effectively. \n\nLegally, there might not be an issue, but morally and socially, it's a gray area. The author could argue they were protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. On the other hand, the author is acting as a gatekeeper, which can be seen as overstepping. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they are sharing private information without consent, which can be considered a breach of privacy. Even if the intention was good, the method was intrusive. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
