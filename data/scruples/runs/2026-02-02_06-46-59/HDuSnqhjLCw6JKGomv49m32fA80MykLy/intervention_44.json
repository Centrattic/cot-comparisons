I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. They found out through a friend, confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex is dating someone new. The person sent an email to the new boyfriend telling him about the cheating, which led to the new boyfriend breaking up with her. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the person an asshole, and the person's former friends (who were taken in by the ex's story) are on her side.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the person is sharing something private and potentially damaging. They had a broken relationship, and using the new boyfriend as a way to exact revenge or inform him could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the person believes they're doing the right thing by informing the new BF, it's possible they're violating their ex's privacy and possibly causing unnecessary harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might feel justified because they believe the new BF should know about the ex's past infidelity. They might see it as a way to protect him from being cheated on again. But the method here is questionable. Directly contacting the new BF without considering the consequences or the person's right to privacy is a big issue. It's not just about the truth; it's about how and why it's shared.\n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the ex and her friends are upset, and the ex's friends don't believe the person's side. This indicates that the person's actions might have backfired, causing more harm than good. The ex might be using the person's actions to manipulate her friends, but that doesn't necessarily make the person right.\n\nIn relationships, especially after a breakup, there's a line about sharing information. While the person might have valid reasons, the act of contacting an ex's new partner to reveal past infidelity without consent is generally considered crossing a boundary. It can be seen as meddling and not respecting the new relationship's privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because they took a personal vendetta approach rather than letting the new relationship handle its own issues.\n"
