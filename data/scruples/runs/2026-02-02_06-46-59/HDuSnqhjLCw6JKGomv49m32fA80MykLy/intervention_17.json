      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is an ex-boyfriend of someone who cheated on him. The cheating happened during the last year of their three-year relationship. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and things were messy. Now, five months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The author decided to email the new BF about the cheating and lying. The BF then broke up with the ex because of this. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole, and his ex-friends don't believe his side of the story.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my take. \n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points here. The author is sharing information that he believes is relevant to the new BF. He did this out of a desire to protect the new BF from being hurt by someone who cheated. On the other hand, the ex has moved on, and the author is interfering in her new relationship. \n\nFrom a privacy and boundaries perspective, sharing someone's personal information, especially about past behavior, can be problematic. Even if the information is true, it's not the ex's place to disclose it. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing by warning the new BF, but he crossed into the BF's domain to inform him directly, which might be seen as invasive. \n\nAlso, the author's actions led to the immediate breakup of the new relationship. Even if the BF made a decision based on that information, the author's role in providing it could be seen as manipulative or interfering. The ex's friends not believing the author complicates things, but that's more about the aftermath than the initial action.\n\nThere's a line between protecting someone from being hurt and violating someone else's privacy. The author's intent was to prevent the BF from being cheated on again, but the method involved sharing personal information without consent. That's a breach of trust and potentially harmful. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to handle their own past relationships and not interfere with others' current relationships. The BF had the right to know, but the author didn't have the right to disclose it. The BF could have asked the ex directly if he wanted to know about her past. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author overstepped by contacting the new BF directly. Even if the information was true, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
