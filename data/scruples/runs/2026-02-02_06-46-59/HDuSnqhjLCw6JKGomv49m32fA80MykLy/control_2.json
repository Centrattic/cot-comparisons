I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (AITA) who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is: the ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, the person found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up. Now, the ex is with a new guy, and the person sent an email to the new BF about the cheating. The BF broke up with the ex because of this. Now the ex and her friends (who believe her over the user) are calling the user an asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. The user is sharing information they have about their ex's infidelity with the new partner. The user's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner had cheated before. But is that their place to do?\n\nLegally, maybe there's no issue, but ethically? Well, when you're not the person in the current relationship, is it their right to share past information? The user might think they're protecting the new guy from being cheated on again. But at the same time, the ex is now in a new relationship, and the user is inserting themselves into that dynamic by sharing something that happened in a previous relationship. \n\nThe user's actions led to the breakup of the new couple. The ex and her friends (who side with her) are upset. The user's friends, who were taken by the ex, might be biased. \n\nSo, is the user at fault? Well, even if the information is true, sharing it with the new partner without the ex's consent could be seen as interfering. It's a gray area. Some might say the user is justified because they want to prevent the new guy from being hurt. Others might say it's meddling and not their place. \n\nBut in many cases, sharing someone's past without their consent can be considered a breach of privacy, even if the information is true. The user might have valid reasons, but the method could be problematic. Also, the fact that the user's own friends side with the ex suggests that the user's credibility might be in question, perhaps due to the messy breakup. \n\nSo, considering ethical standards and social norms, the user's action is likely seen as crossing a line, even if their intentions were good. Therefore, the answer might be that the user is in the wrong.\n"
