I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex cheated on them, which was discovered through a friend. They confronted their ex, who confessed, leading to a breakup. Then, five months later, the ex started dating a new guy. The author sent an email to this new BF about the cheating incident, leading to the new guy breaking things off. Now, the ex and mutual friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author felt it was important to inform the new boyfriend so he could make an informed decision. On the other hand, the action might be seen as interfering or violating privacy.\n\nI should consider the ethics here. Sharing someone's past infidelity with their current partner isn't something people usually do. Even if the author had their own history with the ex, telling a new partner about a past relationship's issues might be crossing a boundary. The author's intention might have been to prevent someone else from being hurt, but the method could be seen as invasive. \n\nAlso, the ex and her friends don't believe the author's side, which adds to the complexity. The friends might think the author is spreading lies or being vindictive. While the author's story is true, the way they chose to share it might be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of privacy and respect. Once the relationship ended, the author isn't in a position to meddle in the ex's new relationships. Informing the new BF could be viewed as a breach of trust or a personal attack, even if the information is factual. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was protecting the new BF from someone who cheated before. But typically, it's the responsibility of the person entering a new relationship to disclose their past if it's relevant. The author stepping in to do that for their ex could be seen as overstepping.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually don't reach out to a new partner to share past issues with an ex. It's more common for individuals to handle their own disclosures. The author's action might lead to justified consequences, as it's not customary and could damage their own relationships with mutual friends.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they invaded their ex's privacy by sharing sensitive information with her new partner, which is generally considered inappropriate regardless of their past relationship.\n"
