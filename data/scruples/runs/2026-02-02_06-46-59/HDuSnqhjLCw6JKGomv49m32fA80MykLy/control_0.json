I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about cheating is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated. The author found out, confronted her, broke up, and now she's with a new guy. The author emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result is the new boyfriend broke up with her, and the author is getting backlash from ex-friends who believe the ex's side.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for telling the new boyfriend? Let me break it down. On one hand, the ex cheated, and the author felt it was important for the new boyfriend to know. The author might think they're doing the right thing by preventing someone else from being hurt. On the other hand, sharing private information without consent could be seen as interfering. The author didn't have permission to disclose that information, which could be a breach of privacy. Even if the ex was dishonest, the author's action might be considered overstepping. However, if the author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend, that's a valid point. But did the author have the right to do that? Maybe not. Generally, sharing someone's confidential information without their consent can be problematic, regardless of the context. The author's ex's new boyfriend had the right to know, but the method of telling might be an issue. However, it's a tough call because the ex did cheat, and the author's action did prevent the new boyfriend from being cheated on. There's a conflict between protecting someone's privacy and preventing harm. In many cases, people might argue that the author was trying to do the right thing, but the approach was wrong. Alternatively, if the ex had a history of being deceptive, the author's action could be justified. But legally and ethically, sharing someone's personal information without consent is usually not advisable. So, the author might be in the wrong for breaching privacy, even with good intentions. But others might see it as a moral duty. Hmm. The answer could go either way, but I think the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the privacy violation, even if the intent was to prevent harm. So the answer is A.\n"
