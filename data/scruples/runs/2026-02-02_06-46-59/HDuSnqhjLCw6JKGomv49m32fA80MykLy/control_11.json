      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, AITA (Am I the Asshole) style.\n\nFirst, the facts: The ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The person found out through a friend, confronted the ex, got a confession, and they broke up. Five months later, they heard the ex is dating someone new. The person then emails the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result is the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and now the ex and her friends are calling them an asshole. The friends don't know the cheating part; they believe the ex's story.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think about the ethics here. Telling someone about their partner's past infidelity is a gray area. On one hand, the person might feel they're protecting the new BF by sharing important info. On the other hand, it's an invasion of privacy and could be seen as interfering. \n\nThe key points here: The author confronted the ex and got the truth. They decided to inform the new BF because they believe transparency is important in relationships. However, the method they used\u2014emailing the BF directly without the ex's consent\u2014might be problematic. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent could be seen as violating trust, unless there's a legal or safety issue. \n\nBut in this case, there's no mention of safety. The author's intent was to pass along information they felt the BF should know. But did they have the right to do that? In many cases, people are advised not to share personal information about a partner's past unless it's relevant and consensual. The BF has a right to know, but the author might not be the right person to relay that info. It's usually the ex's responsibility to disclose her own history.\n\nAlso, the fallout is that the ex and her friends are upset. The friends don't know the full story, so they're taking her side. The author might be seen as retaliating or stirring up trouble, which complicates things. Even if the cheating was real, the action taken could be considered overstepping. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, some might argue that the author is justified to protect others from repeating past mistakes. However, others would say it's meddling and not their place. Legally, there might be no issue, but ethically, it's questionable. The answer often depends on cultural or social norms. In many societies, sharing such information without consent is frowned upon because it's a breach of privacy. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information without the ex's permission, even if the intent was good. The BF should ideally hear it from the ex herself. The author's actions could be seen as undermining trust and causing unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
