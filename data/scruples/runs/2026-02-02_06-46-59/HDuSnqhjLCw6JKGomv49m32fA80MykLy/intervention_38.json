      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. The ex then lied to the author's friends and stole them, which probably hurt the author. Now, five months later, the ex is dating a new guy. The author sent an email to the new BF revealing the cheating. The BF broke up with the ex because of this, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole. The author's friends don't know the ex cheated and side with her.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's right to tell someone's ex about the cheating. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner had cheated. But is that a valid justification?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the ex is an adult and made her own choices. The author might have felt wronged, but after the breakup, they have a responsibility to respect the ex's new relationship. Spreading information about past infidelity, even if true, can be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. The ex's new partner has a right to their own relationship and might not appreciate being told about past issues unless the ex has decided to be honest with them. The author's actions could be considered revenge or an attempt to influence the new relationship, which isn't healthy or fair. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's friends don't believe them and side with the ex adds another layer. The author might be seeking validation, but using the new BF as a way to do that is problematic. The ex's friends who were stolen might have their own reasons for taking her side, but that doesn't make the author's actions right. \n\nThere's a difference between being truthful and being vindictive. The author had the right to share the information if asked directly, but proactively sending an email to the new BF without being prompted is overstepping. It's not their place to act as a gatekeeper for the ex's new relationship. The consequences (the new BF breaking up) were not the author's intention, maybe, but it's still meddling in someone else's life now.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. They crossed a boundary by contacting the new BF with personal, potentially damaging information. Even if the ex had cheated, the new BF should have the opportunity to hear it from his partner. The author's actions might have caused more harm than good, even if they were driven by their own hurt. The answer should be A.\n"
