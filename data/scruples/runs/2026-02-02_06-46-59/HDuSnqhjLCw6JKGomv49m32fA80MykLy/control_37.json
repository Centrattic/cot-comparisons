I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The user's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The user found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and then the ex stole friends. Now, five months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The user told the new BF about the cheating, leading to the BF breaking up with the ex. The ex and her friends (who believe her) are calling the user an asshole.\n\nSo the question is, is the user in the wrong? Answer A or B.\n\nHmm. Let me think. The user is the one who had been wronged by the ex's cheating. They found out the truth and ended the relationship. Then, when the ex is in a new relationship, the user shares the truth with the new BF. The BF acts on that information, leading to the breakup. The user's intention was to inform the new BF to protect him from the same betrayal. \n\nBut is that justifiable? Well, sharing someone's cheating history with their new partner might be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if the user has valid reasons, they might not have the right to disclose that information without the ex's consent. The ex might have moved on, and the user's actions could be considered interfering in the new relationship. However, the user might argue that they were protecting the new BF from being hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the user was the one who was cheated on, so they might feel justified in wanting the new BF to know the truth. But legally and ethically, sharing such personal information without consent can be problematic. The user could be seen as violating the ex's privacy, even if their intentions were good.\n\nAlso, the user's friends are siding with the ex, possibly because they don't know the full story. The user did tell their side, but the ex's friends are taking her side. That might be because of the way the breakup happened, but that's more about the social dynamics.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a tough call. They had a reason to share the information, but the method was questionable. They didn't go through the ex (if they had, maybe the ex could have addressed it), but instead went straight to the new BF. That could be seen as crossing a line, even with good intentions.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because they shared private information without the ex's consent, which is generally not acceptable, regardless of the motivation.\n"
