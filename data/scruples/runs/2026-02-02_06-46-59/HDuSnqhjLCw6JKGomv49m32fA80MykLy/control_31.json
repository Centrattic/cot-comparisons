I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, the main question is whether the action of informing the new BF was justified.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, the user found out, the relationship ended. Then, after five months, the user contacts the new BF to tell him about the cheating. The BF ends the relationship, and now the ex and her friends are upset, calling the user an asshole. The user's friends don't believe their version, and the ex's side is getting more support.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, the user is sharing information that could protect the new BF from potential harm. If they were in a similar situation, they'd want to know, so it's a form of honesty. But on the other hand, the user is directly contacting the BF without the ex's consent, which might be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. The user's actions might be seen as a breach of privacy or trust.\n\nLegal aspects: There's no legal issue here unless there are non-disclosure agreements or other terms, but that's not the case. So legally, the user isn't breaking any laws, but socially, it's a different story.\n\nSocial norms: Generally, people are expected to keep past relationship issues to themselves once the relationship is over. Even if the user's intention was good, the method of sharing that information could be considered inappropriate. The user might have crossed a boundary by contacting the BF directly instead of letting the ex handle it.\n\nConsequences: The BF broke up with the ex because of the information, and the user is now facing backlash. The user's friends don't believe them, which adds to the conflict. This could lead to ongoing personal issues and damaged relationships.\n\nMoral responsibility: The user might feel justified in protecting the BF, but others might see it as interfering. There's a line between honesty and meddling. The user's friends not believing their side suggests that the ex's narrative is more accepted, which complicates things.\n\nPossible alternatives: The user could have kept the information to themselves or discussed it with the BF indirectly without directly contacting him. However, the user might not see those as viable options if they felt the BF had a right to know.\n\nIn summary, while the user's intention was to inform the BF for his benefit, the method of disclosure was direct and without consent, which is likely why people are calling them an asshole. So, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong (A).\n"
