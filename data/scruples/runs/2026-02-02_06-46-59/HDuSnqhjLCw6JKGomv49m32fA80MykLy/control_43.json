I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. Let's break it down.\n\nSo, the ex cheated, the person found out, the relationship ended. Then, the ex starts dating someone new. The person in question contacts the new boyfriend via email, telling him about the cheating. The new boyfriend breaks up with the ex, and now the ex is getting backlash from her friends, who don't believe the person's side.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the person did the right thing. On one hand, they might feel they're doing the right thing by warning the new BF about the ex's infidelity. On the other hand, the ex might see this as interfering or spreading gossip. \n\nBut wait, the person didn't have a right to share that information, right? Even if they felt justified, did they cross a line? The new BF had his own reasons to end the relationship, but the person's action directly caused that. So, maybe they overstepped by contacting him without the ex's permission. \n\nAlso, the person's ex-friends are siding with the ex, which complicates things. The person might have thought they were helping, but maybe they should have focused on their own healing instead of interfering in the ex's new relationship. \n\nIn situations like this, boundaries are important. Once a relationship is over, sharing private information about the ex to a new partner can be seen as meddling. The person might not be in the wrong for wanting to protect the new BF, but the method was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they shared sensitive information without the ex's consent and it caused harm. But maybe some would argue B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to prevent someone else from being cheated on. But generally, taking it upon oneself to inform someone else's partner is considered overstepping. So likely A.\n"
