I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The ex cheated, the author found out and broke up. Then, five months later, the author contacted the new boyfriend to inform him about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke things off, and now the ex and others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo the key issue here is whether it's justified to inform an ex's new partner about past infidelity. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their partner cheated before. But does that make it okay to spread that information?\n\nI need to think about the ethics involved. Telling someone about their partner's past can be seen as a form of revenge or interfering. Even if the information is true, sharing it without the ex's consent might be considered a breach of privacy. The ex's new boyfriend has a right to know, but the method and intent matter. \n\nThe author's actions led to the breakup of the new couple, which might be justified if the information was truthful, but it's still a sensitive situation. However, the author didn't go through proper channels. They didn't go to the new boyfriend through the ex or a mediator. They emailed him directly, which is more of a direct approach that could be seen as aggressive.\n\nAlso, the ex is now facing backlash from her friends who believe her side because the author's own friends support her. The author's friends might be biased, but the ex's new boyfriend was just informed by someone he didn't know. \n\nLegally, unless there's a non-disclosure agreement, the author might not be at fault, but morally, it's a gray area. The author had a right to be angry, but sharing personal information about an ex to their new partner is often frowned upon. People usually handle such situations by not interfering, unless there's a legal necessity.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they took personal action that interfered in someone else's relationship, even if their intent was to prevent future hurt. The right approach would have been to let the new boyfriend discover it on his own or through the ex. Directly intervening can be seen as crossing a boundary.\n"
