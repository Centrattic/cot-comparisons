I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The person argues that they were trying to do the right thing by informing the new BF, since they would want to know if their partner had cheated. But others are calling them an asshole.\n\nHmm. Well, from a general perspective, when someone ends a relationship, especially after a betrayal, there's often a lot of emotional residue. The author found out about the cheating through a friend, confronted the ex, and broke up. Now, they learned the ex is with someone new and decided to email the new BF the details. \n\nIs that justified? Well, the ex was the one who cheated, but the author is taking it upon themselves to inform the new BF. Even if the author's intention was to protect the new BF from being cheated on again, does that give them the right to spread that information? \n\nIn relationships, people often expect privacy. Even if someone is wronged, taking matters into their own hands by informing the new partner without the ex's consent might be seen as crossing a boundary. The ex's actions were bad, but the author's response might be considered interfering or retaliatory.\n\nAlso, the ex's friends are siding with her, which complicates things. The author might have valid reasons, but their method could be problematic. There's a line between sharing truthful information and using it as a weapon. The author might be trying to do the right thing by the new BF, but doing it in a way that's invasive and possibly malicious.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions led to the breakup of the new BF and the ex. While that might be the author's desired outcome, it could also be seen as undermining the ex's new relationship. The author might feel justified, but the ethical question is whether they had the right to step in like that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the ex cheated, the author's decision to email the new BF is likely crossing into the realm of being in the wrong. They didn't go through the ex to get that information to the BF; instead, they took unilateral action. That's probably why others are considering them an asshole. The right approach would be to let go and not interfere, even if the ex's actions were hurtful. So, the answer is A.\n"
