It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. Now, five months later, the ex is dating someone new. The author emailed the new boyfriend to inform him about the cheating, leading to the new boyfriend breaking up with the ex. The ex and her friends are now calling the author an asshole, and the ex's friends who were previously the author's friends believe the ex's version.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author do the right thing? The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner had cheated before. That makes sense, as honesty is important in a relationship. But is it the author's place to inform the new boyfriend? The author might feel they're protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. However, intervening in someone else's relationship by sharing private information could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThere are a few angles to consider. Legally, there might not be an issue, but ethically, it's more complex. The author's ex is an adult and has the right to privacy regarding her past. The author's action might be seen as a breach of trust, even though the ex cheated. The author could have been motivated by revenge, especially since the ex stole their friends. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were preventing the new relationship from repeating past mistakes. But is it their responsibility? The new boyfriend might have his own way of handling his relationship, and the author's email could be seen as meddling. \n\nAlso, the author's friends now believe the ex's side, which suggests there's some credibility issues here. If the ex lied before, the author's friends might be biased. But that doesn't justify the author's actions. \n\nAnother point: The author is still emotionally involved if they're reaching out to the new boyfriend. Maybe they want to hurt the ex or get revenge. The timing of the email, five months later, might indicate lingering resentment. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a difference between sharing information and interfering. The author might have a valid reason, but the method is questionable. Did they contact the new boyfriend directly without the ex's consent? That's a breach of privacy. The new boyfriend might appreciate the heads-up, but the author's approach was abrupt and could be seen as manipulative.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned in some ways, crossed a line by sharing personal information without consent. Even if the ex was at fault, the author isn't justified in becoming a mediator in her new relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
