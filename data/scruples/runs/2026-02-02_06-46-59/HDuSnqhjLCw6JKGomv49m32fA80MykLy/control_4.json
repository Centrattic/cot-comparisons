I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The ex cheated, the person found out through a friend, confronted her, broke up. Then, months later, they told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The ex and others are now upset, saying the person is an asshole. \n\nSo, the main question is whether revealing that information was justified. On one hand, the person might feel they were protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. They mention they would want to know if their partner had cheated. But on the other hand, sharing such personal information without consent can be seen as invading privacy. \n\nThere are a few angles here. The person's intent was probably to prevent the new boyfriend from getting hurt, but maybe they crossed a line by spreading the information. The ex's actions were wrong, but the person's retaliation might not be the right approach. \n\nEthically, there's a debate about whether the ends justify the means. Even if the truth is important, disclosing it without the ex's permission could be considered meddling. Also, the fact that the person's friends believe the ex's side might indicate a bias, but that's more about the aftermath.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the action of telling someone else about a past relationship's issues, especially after it's over, could be seen as inappropriate. It's possible that the person has a valid point about wanting to protect the new boyfriend, but the method might be questionable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the person is in the wrong (A), because sharing intimate details of a past relationship with someone else's partner without their consent, even if the information is true, is generally considered a breach of privacy and meddling. The person's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, were invasive and could be seen as unethical.\n"
