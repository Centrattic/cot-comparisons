I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. The writer found out through a friend that the ex was cheating, confronted her, broke up, and then later told the new boyfriend about the cheating after some time. Now the ex and mutual friends are calling the writer an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The writer had a valid reason\u2014they knew their ex cheated, and they felt the new boyfriend should know. But did they have the right to share that information? There's a line between protecting someone and violating privacy. \n\nThe writer mentions they would want to know if their partner cheated. That's a common justification for such actions. But does the end justify the means? By contacting the new boyfriend directly, the writer is taking on the role of informing another person's partner about past infidelity, which can be seen as invading privacy. \n\nAlso, the writer's ex and mutual friends are siding with the ex, not believing the writer's version. This could be because the writer might have acted out of spite or without considering the consequences. Even if the writer's intention was good\u2014to protect the new boyfriend\u2014it's possible they overstepped by spreading the information without the ex's consent. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the breakup being messy and the ex stealing friends. The writer might be acting out of lingering resentment. But does that justify the action? It's a gray area. Legally, there's no wrongdoing in sharing factual information, but socially and ethically, it's questionable. \n\nThe key points are: the writer knew the truth, shared it with the new boyfriend, the ex is upset, friends are biased against the writer. The writer's action led to the breakup, which might have been the right decision for the new relationship, but the method is debatable. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It depends on perspective. The action might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the information is true. Alternatively, it's a protective act. However, the writer didn't go through proper channels, like advising the ex to tell the new boyfriend herself. Instead, they took direct action, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards yes (A), because sharing someone's personal information without their consent, even if it's true, can be considered a privacy violation and a breach of trust. The writer didn't have the right to act as a messenger in this situation.\n"
