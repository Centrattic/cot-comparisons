I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. Then, when the ex started a new relationship, the author emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The boyfriend broke things off, and now the author is being called an asshole by ex-friends who side with the ex.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Telling someone about an ex's cheating seems like a gray area. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on, which is a valid concern. But on the other hand, sharing such information without the ex's consent could be seen as interfering in their new relationship. \n\nThe key points to consider: Did the author have a right to share this information? The new boyfriend has a right to know if he's getting into a relationship with someone who has a history of cheating. However, the author didn't go through the ex to inform her first; they directly contacted the new partner. This could be seen as violating privacy or trust. \n\nAlso, the aftermath is that the author's ex and their friends are upset, and the author's motives might be influenced by lingering anger or a desire for revenge. While the intention was to warn the new boyfriend, the method might be considered inappropriate. \n\nIn many cases, it's generally advised not to interfere in others' relationships, even if the information is true. The author might be overstepping their bounds here. So, while their intention was to prevent another person from being hurt, the action itself could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, which is a breach of privacy and could be seen as meddling in someone else's relationship.\n"
