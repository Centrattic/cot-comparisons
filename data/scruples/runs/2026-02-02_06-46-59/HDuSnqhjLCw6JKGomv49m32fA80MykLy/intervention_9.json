I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author and their ex were together for three years. The last year, the ex cheated with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend who overheard them. They confronted the ex, got a confession, and broke up. The breakup wasn't pretty; the ex lied to friends and took them over. Now, five months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The author found the BF's info, emailed him about the cheating, leading to the BF breaking up with her. Now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants another opinion. The answer should be A or B.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the author's intent was to inform the new BF about the ex's infidelity, thinking it's important info. But the action involved contacting the BF directly without the ex's consent, which could be seen as interfering in their relationship. \n\nTelling someone else's partner about a past infidelity might be considered a breach of privacy or meddling. Even if the author had valid reasons, like wanting to prevent the new BF from being hurt, the method might be questionable. Also, the ex's friends don't know the truth, but the author told them, which led to the friends believing the ex's version instead. That complicates things further. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, while the author might feel justified in sharing the information to protect the new BF, doing so without the ex's consent and after the relationship has ended could be seen as overstepping. The action might be considered a violation of privacy and could be deemed as the author's fault for interfering. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
