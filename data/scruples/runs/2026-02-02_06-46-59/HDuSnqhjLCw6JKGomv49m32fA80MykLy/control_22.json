It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe person's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. They found out through a friend, confronted her, and the relationship ended. Now, five months later, the ex is dating a new guy. The person in question emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and the ex and friends are calling the original person an asshole. The user wants to know if the person is wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, from a moral standpoint, there's a lot to unpack. The ex cheated, which is a betrayal. The person telling the new boyfriend might feel they're doing the right thing by informing him. But on the other hand, did they have the right to do that without being asked? The ex and the new boyfriend are in a current relationship, so maybe the new boyfriend has a right to know. But maybe the person shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to be the one to tell.\n\nAlso, the person says they wanted to know if their partner cheated. That's a valid perspective. However, sharing that information without the ex's consent could be seen as vindictive or interfering. The ex might not have shared that with her new partner, so the person is stepping into a role that might be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nAnother angle: the person's actions led to the breakup of the new relationship. That's a big consequence. Even if the cheating was true, did they have the right to cause that? It might be considered meddling, especially if the new boyfriend wasn't given a chance to hear both sides. Also, the ex's friends believe her story, which could mean the person is being blamed for causing drama.\n\nLegally, there's probably not an issue, but ethically, it's a grey area. The person might feel justified, but others might see it as not their place to interfere. So, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. However, most people would say that even if the truth is revealed, the method of revealing it without consent could be problematic. So, maybe they are in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
