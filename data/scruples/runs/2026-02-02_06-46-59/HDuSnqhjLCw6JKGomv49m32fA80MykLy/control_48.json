I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated on them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex cheated during their 3-year relationship, found out by a friend, they had a messy breakup, and now the ex is dating someone new. The user sent an email to the new BF revealing the infidelity, leading to the BF breaking up with her. Now, the ex and mutual friends are calling the user an asshole, but the friends don't know about the cheating.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is whether it was right for the user to inform the new BF about the cheating. On one hand, the user might believe they were doing the right thing by preventing the new BF from being cheated on again. They might feel it's their duty to protect someone from the same hurt they experienced. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is sharing personal information about their ex without her consent. Even though the user was wronged, spreading that information could be seen as violating privacy or causing unnecessary harm. The ex is now with someone new, and the user's actions might be considered interfering in someone else's relationship. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the user's motives. Were they acting out of genuine concern for the new BF, or was there a desire for revenge or to get back at the ex? The user mentions they wanted to know if their new partner cheated, implying a belief in transparency. But the method of disclosure\u2014emailing the new BF directly\u2014might not be the most appropriate. \n\nIn terms of typical AITA scenarios, this is a classic case where the person might be seen as justified in their actions but crosses a line by involving someone else without consent. The user's ex is the one who cheated, but the act of informing the new BF is where the judgment usually falls. \n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the user's actions caused further conflict, and now they're facing social backlash. The friends who took the ex's side might not know the full story, but the user's method of disclosure could have contributed to that. \n\nSo, considering all angles, while the ex's actions were wrong, the user's method of addressing it by directly informing the new BF might be seen as inappropriate. Therefore, the user could be considered in the wrong, even if their intentions were good. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
