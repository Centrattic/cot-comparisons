I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, the ex cheated, and the author found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, ended the relationship, and now the ex is with someone new. The author emails the new boyfriend to inform him about the cheating. The new guy breaks up with the ex because of this info. The ex and her friends are upset, thinking the author is an asshole.\n\nThe main question is about the author's actions. Legally, maybe not much here, but ethically? Well, the author has a valid reason because they would want to know if their partner cheated. However, intentionally sharing someone's private information, even if true, can be seen as a breach of privacy. \n\nThe author might argue they were protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. But on the other hand, the author isn't in a position to control the new boyfriend's decisions. Telling someone about a partner's past could be considered interfering. \n\nThe ex and friends are upset because the author is spreading negative information. Even if the information is true, the method of delivery might be questionable. The author could have approached it differently, like not sharing it directly but maybe letting the new boyfriend find out on his own if he asked the right questions. \n\nSo, while the author's intention might be good, the action of directly informing the new boyfriend without his consent might be seen as overstepping. The line between helping and interfering is thin here. Since the author isn't the new boyfriend's partner, they might not have the right to disclose such personal information. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions could be considered wrong because they shared private information without the ex's consent, even if the information was true. It's about respecting boundaries and privacy, even if the intent was to protect someone else.\n"
