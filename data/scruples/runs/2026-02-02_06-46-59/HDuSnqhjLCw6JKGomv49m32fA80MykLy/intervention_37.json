      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author did the right thing by telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. They found out through a friend, confronted her, she admitted it, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex is dating a new guy. The author sent the new BF an email about the cheating, which led to the new BF breaking things off. Now the ex and the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole, especially since the ex-friends believe her side.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to inform the new BF about the infidelity? The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their partner had cheated before. But is it their place to do so?\n\nEthically, it's a tricky situation. On one hand, the ex did cheat, so the information is true. The author might feel that the new BF deserves to know because he's entering a relationship with someone who has a history of cheating. The author's intent was to protect the new BF from being hurt by the same deceit.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one who had the relationship with the ex. The new BF has the right to decide for himself whether he wants to know that information. The author's action was a private disclosure without the ex's consent. Even if the information is true, sharing it without the cheating ex's permission could be seen as an invasion of her privacy, but also as a warning to the new BF.\n\nHowever, the author's method of sharing the information directly to the new BF might have been inappropriate. Instead of approaching the new BF, the author could have considered other ways to address their own closure or seek personal accountability from the ex. By reaching out, the author might have overstepped, especially since it led to the new BF breaking things off, which could have been a harsh consequence.\n\nAlso, the author's friends still side with the ex, which complicates things. The author's decision might have been motivated by a desire to correct the ex's past actions, but it's possible that the author is taking revenge or trying to assert some control over the situation. The author's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intent was good.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but the person who is in a relationship has the responsibility to be truthful about their past. The author might have taken on that responsibility for the new BF, which isn't their role. The new BF should have the right to ask the ex directly if he wanted to know her past. The author's action could be seen as interfering in a way that's not their place.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were likely wrong because they shared personal information about someone else without consent, even if the information was true. The right approach would have been to focus on their own healing and let the new BF form his own opinion about the ex's past.\n"
