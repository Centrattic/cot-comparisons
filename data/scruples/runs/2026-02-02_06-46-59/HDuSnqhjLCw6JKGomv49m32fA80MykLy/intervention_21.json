I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author's ex cheated on them, and after the breakup, the ex stole some of the author's friends. Then, the author found out the ex is dating someone new and told that new boyfriend about the cheating. The boyfriend broke up with her because of that, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex cheated, the author confronted her, ended the relationship, and then later told the new boyfriend. The main question is whether the author acted wrongly by doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that the new boyfriend should know about the cheating, similar to what the author would want to know in their own relationship. It's a matter of honesty and protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. But on the other hand, the author isn't the ex's current partner, so maybe they overstepped by sharing that information without the ex's consent. Also, the author's actions led to the breakup of the new relationship, which could be seen as interfering in a way that's harmful.\n\nThe ex's friends don't know the truth, so they support the ex's side. The author might have a valid reason to protect the new boyfriend, but the method of sharing the information might be questionable. Did the author have the right to contact the new boyfriend directly? Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like not getting involved in the ex's new relationships. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and privacy. The author might think they're being honest and protecting someone, but without being asked, and possibly causing harm, it might be considered overstepping. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they shared personal information without consent, even if their intentions were good. Alternatively, if the action is seen as justified to prevent someone else from being hurt, it might be B. But usually, people are expected not to meddle in others' relationships, even if there's a history of cheating. So probably A is the right choice here.\n"
