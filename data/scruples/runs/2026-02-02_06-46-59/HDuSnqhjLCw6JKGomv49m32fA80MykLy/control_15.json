I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So the situation is: the ex cheated, they broke up, and then the person told the new boyfriend. The ex and some friends are now calling the person an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person's ex was unfaithful, and they found out through a friend. After the breakup, when the ex starts a new relationship, the person tells the new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend breaks things off, and now the ex is getting backlash. The ex's friends don't believe the person, though.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, on one hand, the ex did cheat, which is a betrayal. The person might feel they're doing the right thing by warning the new boyfriend. On the other hand, is it the person's place to do that? Did they have the right to disclose that information without the ex's consent? \n\nI think that even though the ex cheated, spreading that information to the new boyfriend could be considered an invasion of privacy. The person might have valid reasons, but sharing someone's past infidelity without their permission could be seen as meddling. Also, the ex's friends not believing the person suggests there's some bias here, maybe the ex has painted a different story.\n\nBut then again, the person might think they're protecting the new boyfriend from being hurt. However, there's a line between helping and interfering. The action could be seen as retaliatory, especially since the ex stole friends and the person is now facing backlash. But the core issue is whether sharing that info was justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, many would argue that privacy is important. Even if the ex cheated, the person's ex has a right to keep that information private unless they choose to share it. By telling the new boyfriend, the person might be overstepping. So the answer would likely be that the person is in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were good.\n"
