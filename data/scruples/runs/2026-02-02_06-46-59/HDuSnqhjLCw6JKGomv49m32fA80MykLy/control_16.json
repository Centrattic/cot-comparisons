It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up. Five months later, the ex starts dating someone new. The author contacts the new boyfriend via email about the cheating, leading to the new BF breaking up with her. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's action was sharing information about the ex's infidelity with the new partner. The question is whether that's wrong. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the ex was unfaithful, and the author might feel justified in wanting the new BF to know. But on the other hand, the author is sharing private information without the ex's consent. Did the author have the right to do that?\n\nThe author mentions that they would want to know if their new partner had cheated before. That's a common justification, like the \"do unto others\" angle. But does that make it okay? Maybe not, because it's about privacy and consent. The ex's personal history is hers to disclose, not the author's to reveal. Even if the author believes it's in the new BF's best interest, sharing that information without permission is a privacy violation.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the new BF breaks up with her, and the ex's friends side with her, not the author. The author's own friends might not know the full story, leading to social consequences. But does that mean the author was wrong? It's possible the author acted out of a desire to protect the new BF, but the method might be inappropriate. \n\nAnother angle: the author's intent. They wanted to prevent the new BF from being hurt, similar to how they were. But even with good intentions, sharing someone's private information without their consent is generally considered a breach of trust. The ex might have had a right to privacy post-breakup, especially if she wasn't currently the author's partner when the conversation happened. \n\nAlso, considering the timing. Five months after the breakup, the author still has residual anger or desire to retaliate? Or is it a genuine concern for the new BF? It's hard to say, but the action taken is crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's action was sharing confidential information about their ex with her new partner. Even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's method of informing the new BF is problematic because it's not their place to disclose that information without the ex's consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
