I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. The ex cheated during the last year of their three-year relationship. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and now the ex is stealing the author's friends. Then, five months later, the author contacts the ex's new boyfriend, tells him about the cheating, and the new boyfriend breaks up with the ex. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole, and the author's friends don't believe them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is sharing private information about their ex with her current partner. Even though the author might feel justified because the ex cheated, sharing that information isn't something they can control. The ex was unfaithful, but does that give the author the right to inform her new partner? There's a line between seeking justice and taking matters into one's own hands. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as revenge or an attempt to interfere with the ex's new relationship. Even if their intent was to protect the new boyfriend, they didn't approach the ex first to try to resolve the situation or give her a chance to explain further. The author might have their own biases, and the new boyfriend is being told this information by someone who has a history of conflict with his partner. \n\nAlso, the author's friends don't believe them, which suggests that the ex might have a better social reputation or that the author's account isn't trusted. This could indicate that the author's actions are seen as vindictive rather than helpful. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, while there might not be a law against this, ethically, it's a breach of privacy. The author is sharing information that could harm someone else's relationship. Even if the information is true, the method of sharing it without the ex's consent could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might have had the right to be upset about the cheating, but the way they handled it\u2014interfering in the ex's new relationship\u2014could be considered overstepping. The new boyfriend has the right to know, but the author might not be the appropriate person to share that information. The author should have perhaps encouraged the ex to be honest with her new partner instead of taking that step themselves.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while possibly motivated by a desire to prevent the new boyfriend from being hurt, were likely an overreach. They didn't handle it through proper channels and instead took a direct, potentially harmful approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
