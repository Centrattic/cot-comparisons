My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. They want a 60-40 split because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife insists on 50-50 because of equality.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the justification for the split. The author argues that their larger size and higher appetite make 60-40 fair. The wife wants equality, 50-50. The author also mentions they do other things for the wife, like taking her to sushi places where he eats cheaper options while she has expensive ones. So he's trying to balance out the expenses in some way.\n\nBut wait, when it comes to shared meals, especially when they're eating together, does the size or appetite determine the split? Or is it about mutual agreement? The wife's point is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The author's plan to take more after she's full might be seen as manipulative. If he lets her eat until she's full first, then takes her share, maybe she ends up with less, but he's not being honest about it. That could be seen as not respecting her choice once they agreed on the split.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi the same number of times. So, maybe the wife is okay with the frequency, but the division is the issue. If they both have their preferred meals, maybe the pizza is his treat, and sushi hers. But the pizza is a shared meal here. So the expectation of splitting equally might be based on them sharing the expense or the meal together. \n\nThe author's plan to take more after she's done might lead to her feeling taken advantage of. Even if she eats less, the initial agreement was 50-50. If he goes back on that, he's breaking the agreement. The wife's argument for equality is about fairness in the relationship, not just physical needs. Maybe the author is overstepping by trying to impose his own logic of body size over mutual agreement. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong to not agree to a 50-50 split despite the wife's insistence. The wife's perspective is about equality and mutual respect, while the author's is about personal needs. In relationships, respecting each other's preferences and agreements is important. If they agreed to 50-50, even if the author thinks it's unfair, going against that could be seen as not respecting her wishes. The author's plan to take more after she's done is a way to undermine that agreement, which might make him the asshole. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is trying to take more through a loophole. Even if his reasoning seems logical, the key is the mutual agreement and respect in the relationship.\n"
