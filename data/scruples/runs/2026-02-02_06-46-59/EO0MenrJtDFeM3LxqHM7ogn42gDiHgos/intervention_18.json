My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband wants to order pizza, but the wife insists on splitting it 50-50, while he thinks a 60-40 split is fair based on his size and eating habits.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my take. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe husband ordered pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. He argues that because he's taller and bigger, he should get more. The wife, on the other hand, wants an equal split, emphasizing equality. The husband also mentions he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheaper options while encouraging her to get the expensive ones. This might be a point of contention.\n\nNow, considering fairness in relationships. Equality vs. equity. The wife might feel that equal sharing is fair, regardless of size. The husband's argument is based on physical needs, which could be seen as a valid point, but it's also about personal preferences. The husband's plan to eat her leftovers after she's done might come off as manipulative or inconsiderate, even if he doesn't feel bad about it.\n\nThe husband's approach to sushi shows that he might not fully consider her preferences in return. He encourages her to spend on expensive sushi, but he himself goes for the cheaper options. That could be a factor in the wife's insistence on equal pizza portions\u2014she might feel like her preferences aren't being equally considered elsewhere.\n\nAlso, the husband's method of taking her leftovers after she's had her half could be seen as undermining her choice. It's a bit of a passive-aggressive strategy. The wife's demand for half the pizza might not just be about the pizza but about feeling respected and equal in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of social norms, splitting things equally is often seen as fair unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise. The husband's reasoning is logical but might not align with what the wife perceives as fairness. Relationships often require compromise, and maybe the husband isn't compromising enough here. The fact that the wife has to eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day adds another layer, making it seem like he's prioritizing his own satisfaction over her convenience.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if he has a logical argument. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's perspective on equality and is using a somewhat manipulative strategy. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) based on the practical aspect of his larger size. But given the context of the relationship and the need for mutual respect, A makes more sense.\n"
