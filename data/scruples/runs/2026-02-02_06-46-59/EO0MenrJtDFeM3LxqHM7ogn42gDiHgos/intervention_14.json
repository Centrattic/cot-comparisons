My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants 60% and the wife wants 50-50. The author argues it's because he's bigger and eats more, so he should get more. The wife wants equality.\n\nFirst, the fact that they're a couple and how they share food is important. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, but expects half. The author mentions they both indulge in each other's preferences (pizza and sushi), which shows mutual respect. However, the author is planning to take more than half by letting the wife eat until she's full, which he thinks will leave him enough, but she might not eat all her half. The key here is that the author is not just taking more outright but manipulating the situation to get more. \n\nThe wife's stance is about equality, while the author is using size and appetite as justification. But the core issue is fairness in their relationship. The author's plan is a bit sneaky, as he's not directly confronting the issue but rather using a tactic to get his way. It's about mutual respect and compromise. Maybe the wife feels that equal sharing is fair, regardless of physical differences. The author's approach could be seen as undermining that agreement. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author brings up past instances where he's tried to accommodate her (like sushi) might be to show he's considerate, but the pizza issue is a recurring problem. The wife's insistence on half might stem from other values, like equality in their shared expenses or health concerns. The author's argument about body size is a practical consideration, but it's a personal choice and might not be the best reason to override her preferences. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the wife is set on half, maybe the author should respect that, even if he thinks it's unfair. His plan to take more after she eats is a workaround that could be seen as dishonest. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her terms and trying to get around it instead of negotiating or finding a solution both can agree on.\n"
