My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a couple where the husband wants to order pizza, which his wife is okay with because he found a coupon. However, the wife expects half the pizza, while the husband believes a 60-40 split is fair due to his larger size and higher appetite. The husband mentions he's taller and bigger, eats more, and has a history of taking her to sushi, even though he doesn't like the expensive parts. He plans to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers, even if she ends up missing out on leftover pizza the next day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of fairness and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife has given permission for the pizza because she's aware of his love for it and the coupon. The husband's argument is based on his physical size and appetite. However, the wife's insistence on equal halves is about equality in the relationship. The idea of \"equal parts\" in relationships often pertains to mutual respect and fairness in shared resources, not necessarily physical needs. The husband's approach of taking more after she eats could be seen as undermining her autonomy, even if he thinks it's fair. Also, the husband's plan to let her eat natto instead of leftover pizza if she's full might not be malicious, but it's a passive-aggressive way of handling the situation. The key issue here is whether the husband is respecting his wife's terms even if they differ from his own preferences. Relationships require compromise, and the husband's plan to not adhere to her agreement might be seen as him being in the wrong, as he's not respecting her wishes even if he has a logical argument for his stance.\n"
