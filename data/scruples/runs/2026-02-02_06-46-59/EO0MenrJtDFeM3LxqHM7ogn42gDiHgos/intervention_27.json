My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a couple where the husband wants to have pizza with a 60-40 split, but the wife insists on half each. The husband argues based on their body size and eating habits, while the wife wants equality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness in a relationship. The wife agreed to the pizza purchase, so she's not against it. But the split is the issue. The husband thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife thinks equal halves are fair. \n\nI should think about mutual respect and compromise. Relationships often require both parties to make concessions. The husband mentions that he takes her to sushi places and encourages her to order expensive plates, which shows he's making efforts for her. However, in return, he expects a different split that his wife isn't comfortable with. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband is being unreasonable by not accepting the 50-50 split. Even if he eats more, the wife's insistence on equality might stem from a sense of fairness in decision-making, not just quantity. The husband's plan to take her half after she's done could be seen as sneaky and disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the wife might feel that the pizza is a shared treat, so splitting it equally makes sense. The husband's approach could undermine her sense of being an equal partner. The fact that he's using a coupon and it's a rare occurrence (4 times a year) might mean the wife isn't opposed to the expense, but the division is where the conflict lies.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's insistence on a 60-40 split without mutual agreement could be seen as disregarding his wife's perspective. The answer might be that he's in the wrong because fairness in a relationship often requires both parties to find a middle ground, and his plan to take more after she's done isn't respectful. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
