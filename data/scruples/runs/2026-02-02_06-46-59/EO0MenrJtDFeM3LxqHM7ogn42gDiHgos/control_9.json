My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on half each. The author plans to take the remaining pizza after she's done eating her half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza using a coupon, which shows some compromise. The author also takes her to sushi places, so there's mutual effort in their relationship. The core issue is the division of the pizza. \n\nThe wife's stance is about equality, wanting half each. The author argues that fairness is based on their physical needs. But equality in relationships isn't always about splitting things 50-50. It's also about mutual respect and communication. The author's plan to take the leftover pizza after she's done might be seen as underhanded. While he might be eating more, taking her leftover without her consent could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he orders pizza 4 times a year, so the frequency isn't high. The wife's insistence on half could be her way of feeling involved or fair. The author's solution to let her eat first and then take the rest might work, but it's a passive-aggressive approach. Maybe a better way is to discuss and find a middle ground that both are comfortable with, rather than trying to outsmart each other. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife might feel her needs are being dismissed. The author's reasoning is logical, but in relationships, emotional aspects matter. The key is whether the author's actions are respectful. Taking the leftover without her knowing could be seen as inconsiderate. The wife might feel her request is ignored, leading to resentment over time. \n\nSo, the author's plan might not be the right approach. Instead of trying to get his way subtly, open communication is better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes and for the sneaky plan to take the leftovers.\n"
