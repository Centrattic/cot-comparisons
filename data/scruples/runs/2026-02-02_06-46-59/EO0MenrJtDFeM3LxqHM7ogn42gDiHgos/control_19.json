My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon their wife allowed, but she wants half, while the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more. The wife wants equality, but the author plans to take her leftovers after she's full.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so the author isn't going against her wishes entirely. They both have different preferences: the author likes pizza more and eats more, while the wife prefers sushi but the author takes her there. The author orders cheaper sushi for themselves but encourages her to get the pricier stuff. This shows they're trying to accommodate each other's tastes in different ways.\n\nThe main issue is the split. The wife wants equal halves, but the author argues for a 60-40 split based on size and metabolism. The author's plan is to let the wife eat her fill, which they believe will be less than half, and then take the rest. The wife might feel this is unfair because she's being asked to take less, even if she's full. The concept of equality in relationships is important here. Even if the author eats more, the wife might see the pizza as a shared item, so equal sharing is her way of showing fairness. The author's approach might be seen as taking advantage, especially since they were given permission to buy it, which might imply mutual agreement on sharing it equally. \n\nBut then, the author is also making sacrifices by ordering cheaper sushi for themselves. So there's a balance of compromises. The question is whether the 50-50 split is more about equality or fairness. The wife's insistence on half could stem from a different definition of equality, not just physical needs. The author's plan to take her leftovers might make the wife feel disrespected or that her autonomy is being undermined. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's perspectives is key. The wife was given permission to allow the purchase, but she might have expected to share it equally. The author's reasoning is logical, but if they don't consider their wife's feelings, it could create tension. The author's idea of \"fair\" is based on their own needs, but fairness in a relationship often involves mutual respect and consideration beyond just physical aspects. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards AITA (the author is the asshole) because while their reasoning is about fairness, the wife's expectation of equality is also valid. The author is not respecting her right to half the pizza even if they don't eat it all. The plan to take her leftovers the next day might be seen as spiteful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
