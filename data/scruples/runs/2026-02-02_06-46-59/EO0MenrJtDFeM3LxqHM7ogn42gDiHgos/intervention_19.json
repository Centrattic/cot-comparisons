My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple disagreeing on how to split a pizza. The husband wants 60% for himself and 40% for his wife, while she insists on a 50-50 split. He argues that because he's taller and bigger, he eats more, so a 60-40 split is fair. The wife wants equality, saying they should each get half. The husband plans to let her eat her half, and then eat the rest of her portion if he's still hungry, even though that might leave her with natto for breakfast.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In Japan, sharing food equally might be more common, so the wife's insistence on splitting the pizza in half could stem from that cultural norm. The husband is from a different country and associates pizza with his home, so his desire for a larger portion might be about personal preference and nostalgia.\n\nThe key points are fairness and mutual respect. The husband's reasoning is based on his physical size and appetite, but does that justify a 60-40 split? The wife's argument is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. However, equality doesn't always mean identical treatment; sometimes it's about meeting each other's needs. If the wife is okay with the pizza because she's a fan, maybe she would prefer to have more. But in this case, she's not a big pizza lover, so she might be more satisfied with sushi. The husband does take her to sushi places, which shows he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences. \n\nThe husband's plan to eat the remaining pizza after the wife has had her half could be seen as selfish. Even if he's justifying it by his appetite, it might come off as disrespectful to her agreement to split it half. He's not following through on the compromise she proposed, which could lead to resentment. The wife might feel her request is being ignored, even if it's presented as her choice. \n\nAlso, the husband is using a coupon and the wife gave him permission, so he's not being wasteful. However, his method of handling the situation by taking more than agreed upon could undermine trust. The wife's insistence on half might be her way of maintaining control or fairness, and the husband's actions could be seen as undermining that. \n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe a better approach would be to have an open conversation about their preferences and find a solution that both are comfortable with, rather than the husband unilaterally deciding to take more. The fact that he's planning to go through her half if he's still hungry suggests a lack of consideration for her needs, even if she's not a big pizza fan. \n\nSo, while the husband has valid reasons (appetite, cultural attachment), the way he's handling the situation could be considered inconsiderate. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a common relationship value. The husband might not be in the wrong in terms of his reasoning, but his actions could be seen as disregarding her wishes, making him the asshole.\n"
