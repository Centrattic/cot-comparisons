My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple disagreeing on how to split a pizza. The husband wants 60-40 because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split. They both have valid points.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered the pizza with a coupon and the wife agreed. He mentions that he's taller and eats more, which might justify his reasoning. On the other hand, the wife wants equality. The husband also mentions he takes her to sushi places where he eats cheaper options while she gets more expensive ones. That seems like he's being considerate of her preferences, which he might see as balancing things out.\n\nBut the core issue is the pizza split. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The husband's argument is based on physical needs. However, splitting food equally is often seen as fair play unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The husband's plan to take more than half after she eats suggests he's not respecting her share, which could be seen as manipulative or unfair. \n\nThe user is asking for a judgment. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering that the wife agreed to the pizza order but maintains her stance on equal sharing, the husband's plan to go against that might make him the asshole. The fact that he's planning to take advantage of her share could be considered inconsiderate. But maybe in their relationship, they've discussed this before, and the husband feels his way is fair. However, the general consensus might lean towards the wife's expectation of equality being reasonable. So the answer might be A.\n"
