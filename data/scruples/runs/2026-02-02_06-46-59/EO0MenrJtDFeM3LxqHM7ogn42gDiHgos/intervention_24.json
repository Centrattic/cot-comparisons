My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with pizza sharing. The author wants a 60-40 split because they're bigger, but the wife wants half each. They argue that they're equals, hence 50-50. The author plans to take more than half after she's done eating.\n\nHmm. So the main points are fairness, equality, and compromise in a relationship. The wife allowed the pizza because of a coupon and seems to accept that he likes pizza. But she wants an equal split. The author feels their physical size and eating habits justify a different split. However, the wife emphasizes equality. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about physical needs but about mutual respect and compromise. Even if one eats more, insisting on a strict 50-50 might be seen as unfair if one person's appetite is greater. But the wife's stance is on equality, so maybe the author is overcompensating by taking more than agreed.\n\nThe author's plan to let her eat her half and then take some more seems manipulative. It undermines her consent and could lead to resentment. The wife's request for half is a simple compromise. The author isn't in the wrong because the wife didn't specify any rules, but maybe they should communicate better. However, the author's reasoning is based on physical differences, but equality in a relationship often involves sharing equally regardless of appetite. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the wife's wishes for equal sharing despite personal preferences. Or maybe not, because the wife allowed the pizza in the first place and the split is a fair way for her, but the author is just taking what they need. It's a bit tricky. But considering the wife's emphasis on equality and the author's plan to take more than agreed, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
