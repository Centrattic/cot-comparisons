My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple splitting a pizza. The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon, and the wife wants half each, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions he takes her to sushi, but he orders cheaper options while she gets expensive ones.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the division of the pizza. The wife wants equal halves because they're supposed to be equals. The husband argues that physical differences (height, size, appetite) justify a 60-40 split. He also mentions their mutual efforts in other meals, like sushi. But he plans to take what's left after she's eaten her half, even if she doesn't finish it, which might be seen as unfair or taking advantage.\n\nNow, considering fairness in relationships. The wife is setting a boundary she's comfortable with. Even if the husband believes his reasoning is logical, respecting her wishes is important. The concept of equality in a relationship often means respecting each other's preferences, even if they don't align with personal logic. The husband's plan to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers might be seen as manipulative or disrespectful because he's not honoring the agreement they previously had (half each). \n\nAlso, the fact that he's taking her to sushi but opting for cheaper options while she spends more might indicate a pattern where he's making unilateral decisions about their shared expenses, which could be a point of contention. However, the main issue here is the pizza split. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a value she holds, so the husband's refusal to comply without discussion could be seen as dismissive of her values. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often emphasizes mutual respect and compromise. Since the husband is not willing to meet her halfway on the pizza split despite her repeated insistence, he might be in the wrong. The fact that he's planning to take advantage of her leftover half without her consent could tip the scales towards him being the asshole. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her terms and is being selfish, even if he rationalizes it. The key is that in a relationship, respecting each other's boundaries and agreements is crucial, even if you don't personally agree with them.\n"
