My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where he's ordering pizza and wants a 60-40 split instead of 50-50. His wife wants half each, but he thinks his bigger size and higher metabolism mean he should get more. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon and it's expensive in Japan. So she's already giving in by letting him buy it. He mentions he takes her to sushi places and encourages her to order more expensive items, which seems like he's being considerate in other ways. \n\nThe main issue is the pizza division. The author argues that since he's bigger and eats more, splitting it 60-40 is fair. But the wife insists on equal halves. The key points here are about equality versus need. The wife might see equal sharing as part of their equality, while the author thinks fairness should be based on individual needs.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when resources are shared, people might have different needs. If the author can eat more, maybe he should have more. However, the wife's insistence on equal division might be about principle, not just quantity. She might feel that in a relationship, things should be split equally as a sign of partnership, even if one person consumes more.\n\nThe author's plan to take his wife's half after she's done eating is a bit sneaky. Even if he's not in the wrong about the split, taking without her consent could be seen as underhanded. It might erode trust if she finds out. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting more than half. \n\nLegally or morally, there's no rule that a couple must split food equally. If the wife agreed to him buying pizza in the first place, perhaps she's okay with him having more. However, the author is dismissing her request for equality, which could be a matter of mutual respect. \n\nThe wife might feel that her needs are being ignored. Natto is a traditional Japanese food, so maybe she's willing to eat it, but the author's plan to take her leftovers could be seen as selfish. However, the story is from the author's perspective, and he doesn't seem to feel bad about it. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author isn't wrong for thinking he should get more based on his needs, but he's also not respecting his wife's preference for equality. The answer depends on whether the focus is on individual needs or mutual respect for each other's views. \n\nSince the wife's demand is based on equality and the author is acting on his own needs, it's a matter of differing values. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might not be handling it the best way. The question is if he's in the wrong for expecting more than half. If the wife agreed to the pizza, maybe it's okay. But if they had a previous agreement to split equally, then he's not respecting that. \n\nGiven the information, the author's reasoning is logical, but he's not considering his wife's perspective fully. However, the act of ordering pizza was allowed by her, so maybe he's justified in expecting more. The key is that they've had this discussion before, and she insists, so maybe he should comply to maintain harmony. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best action. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a fair split based on his needs, especially since the wife allowed him to order the pizza. The insistence on equality might be her own value, but that doesn't make the author wrong for his stance. However, the way he plans to take her share without her knowing might be where the issue lies, but the question is about expecting more than half. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting a larger portion.\n"
