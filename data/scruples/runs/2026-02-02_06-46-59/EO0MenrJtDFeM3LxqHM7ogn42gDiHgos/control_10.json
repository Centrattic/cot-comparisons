My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about the author wanting to have 60% of the pizza instead of half, because he's bigger and eats more. His wife wants half each. He justifies it by saying they're equal, but he argues for a different split. He also mentions they have other meals where he lets her have more expensive sushi. So, he's planning to give her a full half, but then take the rest if she doesn't finish it.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about fairness and compromise. The author feels that 60-40 is fair based on their sizes and eating habits. The wife wants equality, which is a common way to split things. But maybe the wife's point is about equality in the relationship, not just physical needs. The author is using the physical aspect to justify an unequal split. \n\nBut when he says they're supposed to be equals, she might be emphasizing equal sharing even if their needs differ. The author might be overstepping by not respecting her desire for equal division, even if it's not the most efficient for his consumption. Also, his plan to take her half if she doesn't finish it seems like he's being a bit manipulative. That could come off as selfish, even if he's bigger. \n\nThe fact that he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places the same frequency might balance things, but the immediate situation is about the pizza split. If the wife feels that half is fair, and he's insisting otherwise, maybe he's not respecting her feelings. In relationships, compromise is important, and the wife's request is about equality. The author's argument might be logical, but in a relationship, emotions and mutual respect matter. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her wishes and is planning to take more than his half, even if she's okay with the initial split. The key is that she gave permission to order the pizza, so maybe he should follow through on the agreed split. If he's going to go back on that, he's being dishonest. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not honoring her request for equality, even if his reasoning is logical.\n"
