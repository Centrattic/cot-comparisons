My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza with a coupon, and the wife agreed but wants half each. The author argues that because he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. The wife insists on equality. The author also mentions reciprocating by taking her to sushi, but he eats cheaper options while she gets the expensive ones. Now, he plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then eat the rest himself, even if she ends up eating natto the next day.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether he's wrong. On one hand, fairness in a relationship often involves compromise. The wife might feel that equal sharing is fair, especially since they both agreed to the purchase. The author's reasoning is based on their body size and eating habits, but maybe the wife's perspective is about equality rather than quantity. Also, the author's plan to take her half after she's done could be seen as not respecting her wishes, even if she didn't finish. Maybe the key is that they both agreed to the purchase, but the division is causing conflict. The author's approach might be dismissive of her feelings about equality, which could be the issue. So, even if he's eating more, forcing the split based on his own criteria might be where he's wrong. So I think the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
