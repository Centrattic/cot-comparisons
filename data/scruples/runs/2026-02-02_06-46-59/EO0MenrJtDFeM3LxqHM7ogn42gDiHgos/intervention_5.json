My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's think about this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting a pizza with their wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza because they really like it, and their wife allowed them to use a coupon to buy it. The wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more. The author also mentions they take her to sushi places four times a year, but they order cheaper items while encouraging her to get the pricier ones. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife has agreed to let him buy the pizza, which is something he loves, so she's already making a compromise. She's asking for half the pizza, which is a straightforward split. The author's argument for 60-40 is based on their size and eating habits, but the wife's insistence on equality might be about feeling respected or valued, not just the quantity of food.\n\nThe author's plan to take the remaining half after she's done eating seems underhanded. Even if he believes she'll eat less than half, taking her share without her consent could be seen as dismissive of her wishes. The wife might feel her boundaries are being ignored, especially since she's already made a concession by allowing him to order pizza despite her concerns about health and cost.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author takes her to sushi but only orders cheap for himself might indicate a pattern where he's trying to be considerate, but the pizza situation is creating a conflict. The wife might see the pizza as a rare treat and want to share it equally, while the author is prioritizing his own preference. However, respecting her stated preference is important for maintaining mutual respect.\n\nIn relationships, fairness often involves considering each other's feelings and agreements, even if one side thinks they're justified. The author's plan to take more without her consent could be seen as the wrong move. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
