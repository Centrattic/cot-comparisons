My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if they should feel bad for wanting more than half the pizza when they ordered it with a coupon their wife allowed. The wife wants an equal split, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions he takes her to sushi places where he orders cheaper while she has more expensive options. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife gave permission to get the pizza using the coupon, so he's not going against her wishes there. The main issue is the division. The author justifies it based on his size and eating habits. But the wife wants equality, which might be about fairness from her perspective. \n\nHe also points out that he does something nice for her four times a year with sushi, where he's content with cheaper options. Maybe that's part of his argument that he's already compromising. But does that mean he's entitled to more pizza? \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The wife might feel that despite his size, splitting equally is a way to show they share things equally in the relationship. The author's plan to let her eat her half first and then take leftovers might be seen as manipulative or unfair, even if she ends up eating less. \n\nIs it about equality versus needs? The wife might see equal sharing as part of being partners, while he thinks physical needs should dictate the split. But relationships often require compromise. If he's already doing things for her, maybe he could meet her halfway here. \n\nAlso, the part about her eating natto instead of leftover pizza the next day might be a bit harsh. It seems like he's not considering her feelings and is more focused on his own desires. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe. Even if his reasoning is based on practicality, relationships often value equality and mutual respect over strict logic. The wife's insistence could be about feeling valued and treated as an equal partner, not just about the food. The author's plan could be seen as undermining her wishes, making him the asshole (ITA). So the answer might be A.\n"
