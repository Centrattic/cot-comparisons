My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the pizza situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The husband wants to order a pizza, which his wife initially objected to because of health and cost. But he found a coupon, got her permission, and plans to order a large pizza because he likes eating a lot of it. The wife expects half for herself, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger. He's planning to let her eat her half but then finish the rest if he's still hungry.\n\nSo the core issue is fairness in how they split the pizza. The wife says it's about equality, so she wants half. The husband argues based on physical size and metabolism. The key points here are mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. \n\nThe husband mentions he takes her to sushi 4 times a year, letting her order expensive dishes while he chooses cheaper ones. So he's making sacrifices there. But he's not willing to compromise on the pizza split. The wife, on the other hand, agreed to the pizza because of the coupon. She might see the compromise as equal sharing, not about the amount each eats. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, if they had a prior agreement, maybe. But the wife insists on 50-50, which the husband finds unfair. The husband's plan is a bit sneaky\u2014he lets her eat her half, then takes the rest. That could be seen as not respecting her boundary. Even if she eats less, he's taking what's left without consent. \n\nIn relationships, respecting agreements is important. If she's okay with him having more, maybe there's a middle ground. But the husband is determined to stick to his 60-40 ratio, which might not be fair. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a valid perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's argument that he eats more is practical. However, the way he's planning to handle the situation might be manipulative. Letting her eat first and then taking the rest could be seen as not honoring the initial agreement. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether the agreement was 50-50. If the wife agreed to the coupon pizza but expects equal sharing, the husband's plan to take more without her consent might be the issue. Respect for mutual agreements is key here. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her terms. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if it's about personal needs. Hmm. \n\nI think the consensus would lean towards A because the husband is not honoring the agreed-upon split, even if he has a reason. Relationships require compromise, and his plan could be seen as undermining her wishes. So answer A.\n"
