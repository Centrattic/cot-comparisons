My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the pizza dilemma is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author wants 60% of the pizza because they're bigger and eat more, but their wife insists on a 50-50 split. The author mentions ordering pizza 4 times a year and taking her to sushi 4 times as well, which he thinks is balanced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of fairness in relationships. The wife wants equal shares, emphasizing equality. The author argues that physical size and appetite justify a different split. But is that a valid reason? Maybe not. Equal sharing is a common practice, especially if both are contributing to the cost, even if one eats more. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take the leftovers after she's done eating her \"half\" seems a bit underhanded. If they agreed on splitting it 50-50, going back for her leftovers without her consent might be seen as sneaky or unfair. \n\nThe wife's insistence on half could be about feeling valued or maintaining a sense of fairness in their shared expenses. The author's approach might be dismissive of her needs or preferences, even if she's okay with the coupon allowing pizza. The fact that he's willing to let her have natto the next day instead of pizza might not be the issue, but the method of taking her leftovers without addressing her request directly could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be considerate by taking her to sushi, where he encourages her to order more expensive items. But maybe the wife values the principle of equal sharing in all joint meals, not just pizza. If they're both paying for the pizza, then splitting it equally makes sense regardless of appetite. \n\nSo, the key points are: mutual agreement on splitting the pizza, respect for each other's preferences, and the fairness of the division based on contribution rather than just physical needs. The author's reasoning might not hold in a relationship where both partners expect equal treatment in shared expenses. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not respecting her agreed-upon half.\n"
