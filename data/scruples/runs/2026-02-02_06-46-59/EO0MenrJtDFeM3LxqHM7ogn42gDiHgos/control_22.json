My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a pizza using a coupon with their wife's permission. The wife wants an equal split, 50-50, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. They also mention that the author sometimes takes her to sushi and lets her order expensive items, but he sticks to cheaper options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting the pizza. The wife's argument is based on equality, which is a common approach in relationships. The author's reasoning is about physical needs and personal preferences. But is that a valid reason? Maybe in some contexts, but relationships often involve compromise beyond just physical needs. The fact that the author orders pizza four times a year and sushi four times for her shows consideration, but the sushi example might be a red herring. The key issue here is the pizza split.\n\nThe author's plan to let the wife eat her \"half\" first and then take from it seems underhanded. Even if he's physically hungrier, taking more without her consent could be seen as unfair. The wife might feel her wishes are being ignored, which could lead to resentment. The author's approach of not feeling bad about eating the leftover pizza she didn't finish might be seen as dismissive of her preferences. \n\nAlso, the wife gave permission to buy the pizza, but maybe she expected a shared meal. The author's insistence on a 60-40 split despite her 50-50 request might be the root of the problem. In relationships, compromise is usually expected. If the wife is okay with the pizza being ordered, maybe a middle ground could be found, like he takes a bit more but not 60%, or they split it differently. The author's plan to manipulate the portions after the fact is probably not the best approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon split and is being manipulative. The answer would be A.\n"
