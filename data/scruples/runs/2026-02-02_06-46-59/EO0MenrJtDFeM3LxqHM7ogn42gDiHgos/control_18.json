My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario is about a couple's disagreement over splitting a pizza. The husband wants a 60-40 split based on his size and eating more, while the wife insists on a 50-50 split because they're supposed to be equal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband argues that since he's bigger and eats more, he should get a larger portion. He also mentions that he takes his wife to a nice sushi place four times a year, and he orders cheaper items while she gets the more expensive ones. He feels he's compensating by letting her have her fill first and then taking the leftovers of her half. The wife, on the other hand, feels that equality means an equal split regardless of their physical differences or eating habits.\n\nThe key points to consider are fairness, communication, and mutual respect. The husband's reasoning is based on practical aspects like body size and appetite, but the wife's perspective is about equality in the relationship. The husband's solution of letting her eat her half first and then taking the remaining might lead to her getting less than she intended, which could be seen as a bit of a loophole rather than a fair compromise.\n\nIn relationships, compromises are important. The husband has acknowledged her preferences in sushi, but he's not applying the same flexibility to the pizza situation. His approach might come across as not respecting her boundaries even though he's allowed to order pizza with a coupon. The wife's insistence on equal shares might be non-negotiable for her, and the husband is trying to circumvent that. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It could be argued that he's not considering her feelings and the agreement they made. Even if he's bigger, the wife's stance on equality is her value, and he's undermining that by not respecting her 50% request. His plan to take the leftovers of her half could be seen as a bit sneaky and not a genuine compromise. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her agreement terms, even if his reasoning seems logical on the surface.\n"
