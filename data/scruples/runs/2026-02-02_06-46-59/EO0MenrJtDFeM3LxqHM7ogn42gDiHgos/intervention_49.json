My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. They provided a detailed scenario where the author wants 60% of the pizza, and the wife wants half each. The author thinks it's fair because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on equality.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife allowed him to order pizza with a coupon, but there's a disagreement on how to split it. The author argues based on physical size and appetite, while the wife emphasizes equality. The author also mentions other times he accommodates her preferences, like taking her to sushi. \n\nNow, considering relationships and fairness. The wife's stance is about equality in the relationship, which is a common value. The author, on the other hand, is prioritizing his own preferences and physical needs. The question is whether the author's actions are inconsiderate or not. \n\nThe author's plan to let her eat her \"half\" first and then take the rest seems underhanded, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if he's bigger, relationships often require compromise and respect for each other's boundaries. The wife's insistence on half might be her way of feeling that the purchase is shared, even if it's not equally consumed. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's agreement as a condition for allowing the pizza purchase. If she agreed on the condition that it's split 50-50, then not honoring that could be seen as violating the compromise. Also, his plan to take more without her consent might undermine her autonomy in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author points out he accommodates her by taking her to sushi. But that's a different scenario where he's paying for her preference, which is different from splitting a shared meal. The pizza is his treat, but he allowed her to partake, so splitting it equally could be a fair compromise. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about physical needs but about mutual respect. The wife might feel that her opinion on health and expenses is already considered, so the 50-50 split is her way of asserting equality in consumption. The author's approach could be seen as disregarding her preferences and creating a power imbalance. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting the agreed-upon terms and is acting in a way that could be manipulative and disrespectful to his wife's boundaries."
