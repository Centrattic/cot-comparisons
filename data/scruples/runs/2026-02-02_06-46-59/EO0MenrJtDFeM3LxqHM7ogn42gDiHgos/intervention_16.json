My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author wants to order a pizza but their wife doesn't like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. They found a coupon and got her permission to buy a large pizza. The issue is the division of the pizza. The author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then eat the rest of her half, making her eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness, compromise, and mutual respect. The wife allowed the pizza because of the coupon and health reasons. The author's argument is based on their physical size and eating habits, but that's a personal preference. Sharing equally is a common way to split things, but both should agree on the terms. The author's plan to take more after she eats her half is sneaky and might undermine the agreement. Even if they think the 50-50 split is unfair, they should communicate and find a solution both are comfortable with instead of going behind her back. The author's intention to use leftovers as leverage (forcing her to eat natto) is a bit manipulative. While it's about personal preferences, respecting each other's boundaries and agreements is important in a relationship. So, the author is being a bit selfish and not considering the agreed-upon terms. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
