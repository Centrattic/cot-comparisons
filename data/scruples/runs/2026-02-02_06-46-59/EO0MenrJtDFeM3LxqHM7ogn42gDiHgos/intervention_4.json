My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza. The author's wife doesn't like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan, but the author found a coupon and got her permission to order it. Now the wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent and expectations. The wife gave permission for the pizza order, but maybe she expected a fair split, which to her is 50-50. The author is arguing based on size and appetite, which the wife might not agree with. Even though he mentions he takes her to sushi, maybe that's a separate issue. The problem is whether the 50-50 split is fair. The author's plan is to let her eat her half first, then take leftovers from her share, making her eat natto instead. That sounds a bit sneaky and maybe inconsiderate. The wife might feel that since she allowed the purchase, she's entitled to half. The author's reasoning about body size might not be the best approach here, especially if the wife sees it as a compromise for her allowing the pizza in the first place. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her terms of the agreement. Even if it's a small thing, it's about mutual respect. The answer could be A, but I need to make sure. The wife's perspective is important here. If she agreed to the purchase under the condition of equal sharing, the author is breaking that. So, AITA for not adhering to the agreed split? Maybe the author is the asshole for not respecting her conditions.\n"
