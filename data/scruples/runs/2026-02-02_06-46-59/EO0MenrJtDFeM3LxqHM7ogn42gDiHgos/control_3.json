My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who ordered a pizza with a coupon, and their wife expects half, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more.\n\nFirst, the wife gave permission to buy the pizza because of the coupon, so that part seems okay. The author mentions they don't order pizza often, like four times a year, and they also take her to sushi places the same number of times. The key point here is the division of the pizza. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks it's unfair because of their different appetites.\n\nI need to consider fairness and mutual respect. The wife might feel that sharing equally is a way to be fair, but the author's reasoning is based on physical differences. However, in many relationships, equal sharing is about mutual respect and not just physical needs. The author's plan to take more after she's done eating might come off as sneaky and could hurt her feelings. Even though the author has a logical reason, it might be seen as not respecting her wishes, leading to the \"asshole\" label. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
