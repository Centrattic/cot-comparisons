My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because they're taller and eat more, but the wife demands half each. The author plans to let her eat her half first and then take the leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed the pizza purchase with a coupon, so she's given in to the request. The key issue here is the division of the pizza. The author argues that their body size justifies a larger share, but the wife insists on equality. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being fair. In relationships, fairness can be subjective. The author's reasoning is based on physical needs, but the wife's demand is based on equality and maybe fairness in the relationship. The author is planning to manipulate the situation by letting her eat first, then taking the rest, which could be seen as underhanded. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife doesn't like pizza, so she might prefer more of it if it's available. But the wife's stance is on equal sharing. The author's approach might come off as not respecting her boundaries, even if the wife eats less. The act of taking the leftovers could be seen as taking more without consent. \n\nThe author's history of taking her to sushi 4 times a year might balance out the pizza situation, but the issue here is the immediate action. The wife's insistence on half might be about equality in how they split things, not just the quantity. The author's plan to take more after she's done could be seen as a way to avoid the agreement they didn't reach, which might be the problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not forcing the wife to agree to 50-50, but they're not honoring her request either. The manipulation part (letting her eat first and then taking the rest) might be the key point. The answer could hinge on whether respecting the agreed-upon terms (even if not explicitly agreed) is necessary. If the wife wants half, the author should stick to that, even if they end up with leftovers. Otherwise, the author is being sneaky, which could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might be A, but I need to make sure."
