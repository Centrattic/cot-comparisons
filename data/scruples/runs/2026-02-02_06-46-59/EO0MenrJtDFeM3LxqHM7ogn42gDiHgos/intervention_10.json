My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting to get 60% of the pizza instead of 50/50. The situation is that the author and his wife are splitting a pizza, but he thinks 60/40 is fair because he's taller, eats more, and he feels his body requires more. The wife insists on equal halves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to buy the pizza with a coupon, so she's already giving in to his request. The author mentions that he takes her to sushi often, and he encourages her to order more expensive items. So there's a balance in their activities. \n\nThe main issue is about splitting the pizza. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60/40 is fair. The author's reasoning is based on their physical differences and eating habits. However, fairness can be subjective. The wife might see it as equal sharing, while the author sees it as proportional sharing. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the wife has consistently demanded 50/50, the author's plan to take the remainder after she's done her half could be seen as manipulative. The author is planning to eat more than his share by letting her eat first, which might lead to her not getting enough, especially if she actually eats all her half. This could cause resentment. \n\nAlso, the author is using the fact that he's bigger as a reason. But in a relationship, sometimes it's about equality rather than physical needs. The wife might feel that equal sharing is a sign of respect and partnership. The author's approach could come off as dismissive of her preferences or feelings. \n\nThe plan to make her eat natto the next day instead of leftovers isn't helping the situation. It might be a petty action that adds to the conflict. So, the author is not just splitting the pizza unequally but also planning to make her deal with the consequences, which is not a good approach. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is possibly in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's stance on equality, and his plan to take more could be seen as unfair, even if he has his reasons. It's about mutual respect and compromise in the relationship.\n"
