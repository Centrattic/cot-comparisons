My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. So the situation is that the author wants to split the pizza 60-40 in his favor because he's taller, eats more, etc. His wife insists on a 50-50 split. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning is based on physical size and appetite. He mentions he's bigger and eats more, so he thinks 60% is fair. But the wife's argument is about equality, saying they should be equal. Then the author plans to let her eat her fill, which he expects would be less than half, and then he'll take the leftovers from her half. He also notes that he brings her to sushi four times a year, but she might have to eat natto the next day instead of leftover pizza.\n\nHmm, in relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife's perspective is equality, which is a common value. The author's counter is practicality based on his needs. But is it about equality or about compromise? Maybe the wife feels that insisting on half is her way of showing fairness, especially if they are sharing the expense. The coupon was given with the condition that they split it, so maybe she expected that. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take from her half after she's eaten could be seen as manipulative. Even if she eats less, taking her leftovers without consent might be a problem. It's about respecting each other's boundaries. The fact that he's willing to make her eat natto the next day adds a bit of a sting, maybe implying he's being petty. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning isn't unreasonable. People have different appetites. But in a partnership, sometimes equal sharing is about balancing other aspects too. The question is whether the 60-40 split is a fair compromise or if it's being inconsiderate. The wife might feel that the author isn't respecting her right to an equal share, even if she doesn't eat all of it. \n\nThe author also mentions he orders sushi for her, but he prefers the cheaper options. Maybe the wife values the experience of getting her preferred dish, so expecting the pizza to be split similarly might not consider that. The key issue is communication and mutual respect. If the wife is set on half, maybe the author should accept that, even if it means he'll have leftovers. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The author's approach might be seen as selfish, even if he has a reason. Relationships often require compromise. If they agreed on splitting the pizza 50-50, then going against that could be the problem. Also, the plan to take from her leftovers without her consent could be the asshole move here.\n"
