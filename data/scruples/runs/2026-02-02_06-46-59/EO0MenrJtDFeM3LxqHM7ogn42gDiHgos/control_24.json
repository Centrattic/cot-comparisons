My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The wife says half is hers, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on equality, even though the author argues about their different appetites and physical needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order the pizza because of the coupon, so there's some mutual agreement there. The author is trying to be fair based on their body sizes, but the wife wants equal halves. The author also mentions that he takes her to sushi often, so he's making an effort in return for her allowing pizza. \n\nOn one hand, the wife might feel that since they're a couple, sharing equally is the fair thing to do, especially in terms of partnership and equality. She might not want to feel like she's being given less, even if it's based on appetite. On the other hand, the author is considering their physical differences and actual consumption. But maybe the wife values the symbolic act of equal sharing more than the literal amount.\n\nAlso, the author's plan to let her eat first and then take from her half might not be the best approach. It could lead to tension or resentment. The key here is whether the author is respecting his wife's boundaries. Even if he thinks 60-40 is fair, if the wife has set the condition that it's half each, he's not respecting her wishes. She might see it as him dismissing her feelings about equality in the relationship, even if it's over something small. \n\nThe author's argument is practical, but relationships often involve compromise beyond just practicality. Insisting on his own way despite her repeated demands might make him seem inconsiderate. The fact that he's planning to go ahead without her consent could be seen as the asshole move. So, the answer is likely A, he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her agreement terms and the value of equality in their relationship.\n"
