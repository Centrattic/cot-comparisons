My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a couple ordering pizza, and the wife insists on getting half each time, even though the husband feels their body sizes and appetites mean he should get more, like 60-40. The husband mentions he orders pizza four times a year and takes her to sushi places four times a year, but he prefers the kid's menu, while she likes the expensive fish. He plans to let her eat her half first and then take from it once she's done.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the norms are in relationships regarding sharing food. The wife's argument is that they should be equal, so each gets half. The husband argues that his larger size and bigger appetite justify a different split. But the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness, not just portion size. Maybe she feels that if he's ordering it, he's being selfish, so splitting it equally is her way of maintaining balance.\n\nThen, the husband's response is to let her eat until full, which he expects will be less than half, and then he'll take the rest. That sounds strategic. He's not just taking more, but trying to outsmart her by letting her eat first. However, the wife might feel disrespected if he's taking her leftovers without her consent. Even if she eats less, taking her leftovers could be seen as taking advantage of her, especially if she had already agreed to half being hers. \n\nAlso, the author is planning to make her eat natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza, which he says he won't feel bad about. That's a bit of a passive-aggressive move. Instead of negotiating openly, he's preparing to take his own way, which might lead to resentment. The wife's point about equality could be about mutual respect rather than just the quantity. If he's taking her share, even after she's done, it's not respecting her initial agreement. \n\nThe fact that he brings her to sushi places but sticks to cheaper options doesn't necessarily balance things out. She might want to enjoy the sushi as he does with pizza, but he's not allowing her to have the same experience. However, the pizza situation is about sharing a single order. The wife's request for half might not be about the value but about feeling like they share equally in the meal. \n\nThe husband's main argument is his appetite, but people's preferences and dietary needs can be complex. If she agreed to the pizza because he convinced her it's a treat for him, maybe she's okay with him getting more. But her asking for half could be a non-negotiable boundary. The husband's plan to take from her half after she's done is a way to avoid an argument, but it doesn't address the underlying issue of their differing needs and expectations. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The husband is not wrong for having a bigger appetite, but the way he's handling it might be. Taking her leftovers without discussing might be seen as underhanded. The wife's insistence on equality could be about feeling that their contributions and sacrifices are balanced, not just the food portions. \n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her preference for equal sharing, even if he feels it's unfair. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there are other angles. For example, in some relationships, people adjust portions based on needs, but if the wife has a specific request, not honoring it could be the issue. The husband's approach seems to disregard her stated expectation, which is about equality, even if he's bigger. So probably A.\n"
