My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether splitting a pizza 50-50 is fair, considering the author's arguments. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author wants to order a pizza, which his wife is okay with because he found a coupon. He mentions he's bigger and eats more, so he thinks a 60-40 split is fair. The wife insists on half each. The author plans to let her eat her half, then take the remaining until he's full, leaving her with natto for breakfast.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the fairness of dividing the pizza. The author is arguing based on their physical size and eating habits. The wife, on the other hand, believes in equality. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not accepting a 50-50 split.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. The author is in Japan, where pizza might be more expensive, and the wife is concerned about health and cost. The author brings up that he also takes her to sushi, where he lets her order the more expensive items. He's trying to balance their preferences, but the pizza division is a point of contention.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just the food. The author's plan to take more than his half after she's done could be seen as undermining her wishes. Even if he's taking what he believes he needs, it's important to respect her boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of her preferences. Even if he's physically bigger, the wife's right to set terms for shared meals could be important. The author's method of allowing her to eat first and then taking the rest might lead to resentment. \n\nThe fact that he's planning to ignore her stated half after she's full might be the issue. It's not just about the split but about respecting her decision. The wife's insistence on equality could be a principle, and the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if his reasoning is logical. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's wishes, even if they seem arbitrary. The answer would be A.\n"
