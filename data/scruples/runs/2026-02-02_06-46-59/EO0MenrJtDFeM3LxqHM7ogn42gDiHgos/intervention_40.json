My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon after getting permission from his wife. He wants 60% because he's bigger and eats more, but she insists on 50-50.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife allowed him to buy the pizza, so she's on board with the purchase. The main issue is the division. The husband is arguing based on physical size and eating more, but the wife wants equality. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The husband is trying to justify his portion based on his body needs, but splitting a pizza isn't typically about equal nutritional needs. It's more about shared experience or compromise. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The husband's plan to take more after she's full might seem manipulative, even if he's not directly taking it upfront. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach could be seen as undermining her autonomy. If she's okay with the initial permission, the division should be a mutual agreement. By taking her \"half\" after she's done eating, he's not respecting her choice. \n\nThe husband's reasoning might come off as selfish. Even though he does things like taking her to sushi, it doesn't directly relate to this situation. The main issue is about respecting each other's preferences and agreed-upon terms. The wife's \"equal halves\" might be a non-negotiable for her, so the husband's insistence could be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, overall, the husband is not respecting the agreed-upon split, which the wife found important. Even if he thinks it's fair based on his needs, the wife's position is about equality. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
