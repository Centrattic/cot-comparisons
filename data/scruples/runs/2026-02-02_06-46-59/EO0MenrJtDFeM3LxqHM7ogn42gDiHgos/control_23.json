My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the husband wants to order a pizza and is arguing about splitting it 60-40 instead of 50-50 based on their body size.\n\nFirst, the wife was okay with him ordering the pizza using a coupon. He orders a large because he likes eating a lot, not for value. She insists on half each, but he thinks 60-40 is fair since he's bigger. He mentions they both treat each other to things they like (sushi for her, pizza for him). He even encourages her to spend more on sushi. But she still wants equal pizza.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are consent and fairness. He had permission to get the pizza, but the split is the issue. The wife's argument is equality, while his is based on need. But equality doesn't always mean 50-50; it can mean fairness. However, if both are contributing to each other's treats, the pizza being a personal treat might not require an equal split. However, the wife agreed to him getting it, which implies mutual agreement. But her asking for half might be her way of feeling involved. The husband's plan to take her half after she eats some could be seen as undermining her, making him the asshole for not respecting her initial agreement. Alternatively, if the pizza was a personal treat, he might not be wrong. But the fact that he's taking her share after she eats some could be manipulative. So, maybe he is in the wrong. \n\nAnswer A.\n"
