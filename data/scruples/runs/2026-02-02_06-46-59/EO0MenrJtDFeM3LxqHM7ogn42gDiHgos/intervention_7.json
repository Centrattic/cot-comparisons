My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about ordering a pizza and splitting it 50-50 versus wanting a 60-40 split because they're bigger and eat more.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon with the wife's permission. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheap while she orders expensive. So he's trying to balance out his pizza indulgence with her sushi experiences.\n\nThe wife's reasoning is that they're supposed to be equals, so half each. The author's reasoning is based on their physical differences and eating habits. The key here is whether a 50-50 split is fair. The wife's argument is about equality in the relationship, while the author's is about practicality of consumption.\n\nBut relationships often require compromise beyond just physical needs. The author is using the 60-40 ratio as a justification, but the wife has already given permission for the pizza. Maybe she expects a fair split because even though he ordered it with her consent, she wants equal sharing. The author's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done might be seen as unfair or taking advantage. Also, the mention of her eating natto instead of leftover pizza could imply he's being selfish rather than flexible.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for expecting more than half. The wife's point about equality is central here. Even if one person eats more, in a shared meal, splitting it equally might be the respectful thing to do unless the other person is okay with a different split. The author's approach seems to undermine the agreed-upon equal sharing, which his wife values. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not respecting her expectation of equality despite her not liking pizza as much. The answer is likely A.\n"
