My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple splitting a pizza. The husband wants 60-40 because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife wants half each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're in Japan, where pizza might be expensive. The husband used a coupon with the wife's permission. He orders a large pizza not for value but because he likes it. The wife wants half, but he thinks 60-40 is fair. He also mentions taking her to sushi 4 times a year, but he eats cheap plates while she can get expensive ones. \n\nNow, the key points: Is it fair to split 60-40 based on size? The wife's argument is about equality. The husband's reasoning is based on physical needs. But equality in relationships isn't always about splitting things equally. Sometimes it's about mutual respect and compromise. \n\nThe husband's plan is to let her eat her half first, then take from it when he's done. That seems sneaky and not honest. Even if he's bigger, taking her portion after she's done could be seen as underhanded. \n\nAlso, the wife has agreed to the pizza once, and now he's trying to negotiate the split. Maybe the wife values equality in sharing, while he's prioritizing his own preferences. The husband's actions might be dismissive of her feelings about fairness, even if he's planning to technically follow through with her 50% but take more. \n\nThe sushi part shows he tries to be considerate by letting her have better meals, but when it comes to pizza, he's not reciprocating the same consideration. Maybe the issue is that pizza is his treat, and he's using it as an excuse to get more, but the wife feels entitled to equal parts regardless. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always a 50-50 split, but it's about mutual respect and communication. The husband's approach is passive-aggressive. Instead of discussing and finding a compromise, he's planning to take more while not being upfront. That's probably where he's in the wrong. The wife's stance on equality might be about feeling heard and valued, not just the pizza itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being fair in his approach, even if he's bigger. The way he plans to take more without mutual agreement is the issue.\n"
