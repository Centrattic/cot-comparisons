My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing about pizza portions. The author wants 60% of the pizza, while the wife wants half each. The author justifies it based on size and appetite.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The wife agreed to the pizza because of a coupon, but the division is a problem. The author feels that since he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. The wife, on the other hand, wants equality, maybe because of the \"equal partnership\" idea. \n\nI should consider cultural factors too. In Japan, maybe portion sizes or sharing practices are different. The author mentions it's expensive, so maybe splitting equally is a way to manage costs. The author's plan to take the remaining pizza after the wife is done sounds sneaky and could be seen as undermining her. \n\nThe author also mentions that he takes her to sushi places, but he eats cheaper options. Maybe he's trying to balance by compensating her in other ways. However, the wife's insistence on equal pizza portions might be about fairness in sharing, not just hunger. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If both agreed to split it, but he's going against her wishes and planning to take more, that could be seen as disrespectful. Even if he has a reason, respecting her boundaries is important in a relationship. The plan to take the leftover pizza without her consent might make him the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she's being unreasonable if he really eats more. But in a partnership, compromise is key. If he agreed to split it, maybe he should stick to that. The fact that he's planning to take more anyway shows a lack of respect for her agreement. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But I need to check again. The wife agreed to the pizza but not the division. The author is going against her stated expectation. The idea of equality vs. practicality. Maybe the wife is being fair in her own way. The husband's plan is manipulative. So, likely A.\n"
