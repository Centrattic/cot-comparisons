My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The story is about a couple where the husband wants to order pizza, and the wife expects half, but he thinks he should get more because he's bigger and eats more. The husband orders pizza a few times a year and also takes her to sushi, but she still insists on equal shares.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife gave permission to order pizza with a coupon, so that's a start. The husband argues that 60-40 is fair based on their body size and eating habits. The wife thinks equality in sharing is important. The husband's plan is to let her eat her half first and then take the remaining, which she might not finish. \n\nIs it fair to argue that he's being selfish? The wife might see it as both contributing to the meal, so sharing equally is fair. The husband's reasoning is based on physical needs, but maybe the wife values emotional equality more. The husband also mentions that he takes her to sushi, but he's eating cheaper options, which could be a point in his favor. However, the main issue is the pizza sharing. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong for not splitting it 50-50. If the wife explicitly agreed to the pizza being ordered and expects half, then he's not respecting her terms. The fact that he plans to take more after she eats her share might be seen as sneaky. On the other hand, if he's eating more, maybe the 60-40 is fair. But since she set the condition, maybe he should comply. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If he keeps overriding her expectations, that could be the issue. Even if he's bigger, mutual respect is important. The answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some contexts, dividing equally is seen as fair even if consumption differs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's condition even though it's based on equality. The plan to take more after she eats could be seen as undermining her wishes. So the answer would be A.\n"
