My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the husband wants to order pizza, and there's a disagreement over how to split it.\n\nFirst, the husband got permission from his wife to order pizza with a coupon. He argues that because he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. The wife wants half each. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, where he lets her have expensive plates while he eats cheaper ones. But she still insists on equal pizza portions.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and fairness. He had permission to get pizza, so that's a start. But the division. The wife wants equal halves, but the husband thinks 60-40 is fair based on their body size and metabolism. \n\nThe key here is that he was given permission to buy the pizza. The wife's condition now is splitting it equally. But he's planning to let her eat until she's full (which he expects would be less than half) and then eat the rest. Is this fair? \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, sharing food is a matter of personal agreement. The wife might see equal sharing as part of the deal because they're equals in the relationship. The husband is arguing for practicality based on their physical needs. But he was given permission under the condition of splitting it equally? Wait, did she specify that when she gave permission? The text says she gave permission to buy it but didn't mention the split. So maybe the wife's expectation of half is an after-the-fact addition. \n\nThe husband's plan is to let her eat her half first, but if she stops before finishing it, he'll take the rest. That might be seen as manipulative. Even though he's not technically wrong in a legal sense, morally, it's about mutual respect. If she agreed to the purchase under the assumption of equal sharing, and he's going to go back on that, that could be seen as breaking an implicit agreement. \n\nAlso, the husband's justification is based on their sizes, but maybe the wife feels that equality in the relationship means equal sharing regardless of physical needs. So there's a conflict between practical fairness and emotional fairness. \n\nI think the husband's approach is self-serving. He's using the fact that she agreed to let him get pizza, but then trying to take advantage of her by not adhering to her expectation of equal split. Even if he's bigger, if the wife expects half, then not honoring that could be seen as inconsiderate. Plus, his plan to take her leftovers after she's done is sneaky. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her terms even though she allowed him to get pizza. The initial permission was given, but the split was part of the agreement. If she expects half, and he goes against that, he's being unfair. Alternatively, if she didn't specify the split when giving permission, maybe she's adding that later. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The community on AITA often considers the emotional and relational aspects. Since he's planning to deceive her by taking her portion after she's done, that's probably where the wrongdoing is. So the answer would be A.\n"
