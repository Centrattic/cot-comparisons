My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The main issue is about splitting the pizza 50-50 versus the author's suggested 60-40 split. \n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza using a coupon with his wife's permission. The wife wants half each, but he argues for 60-40 because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi 4 times a year, where he encourages her to order expensive dishes while he gets cheaper ones.\n\nThe key points here: The wife agreed to the pizza purchase with the coupon. The author's reasoning is based on his size and appetite. However, the wife values equality, which is common in relationships. The author plans to take more than half, even if she doesn't finish her share, which might be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe sushi part shows he's willing to let her have more there, but pizza is different. The wife's insistence on equal portions might be about fairness or other reasons beyond just quantity. The author's plan to take leftovers after she eats could be perceived as not respecting her wishes, even if she eats less. \n\nIn many relationships, compromise is key. The author is not wrong for wanting more, but the way he's handling it (by taking more without agreement) might be the issue. The wife's perspective of equality is valid. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's dismissing her valid request for equality despite her agreeing to the purchase. However, some might argue it's a matter of personal choice. But typically, AITA leans towards considering mutual respect, so the author might be the asshole.\n"
