My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple arguing over how to split a pizza. The husband wants a 60-40 split, while the wife wants 50-50. The husband argues that he's bigger, eats more, and they're already equal in other ways, like sushi outings. The wife insists on equal halves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The husband feels it's fair to have more based on his physical size and appetite. The wife, on the other hand, wants equality. The husband has a coupon and permission, so the pizza is ordered because the wife agreed. The key issue is the division of the pizza.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. In relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might see 50-50 as fair for equality, while the husband sees 60-40 as fair based on needs. The husband's plan to take more than half after letting the wife eat her fill might be seen as sneaky. Even though he reasons it's fair, it could be perceived as not respecting her wishes, leading to conflict.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that the wife might have to eat natto instead of leftover pizza, which could be a point of contention. The wife might feel disrespected if the husband goes against her stated preference without discussion. The husband's approach of letting her eat her half first and then taking more could be seen as a way to get around her wishes, which might be the issue here.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, dividing things equally is often expected in relationships, especially when both parties contribute to the expense or decision. The husband's justification based on size and appetite might not hold up in a relationship context where mutual respect and equality are emphasized. The fact that he takes more after she eats her half could be seen as undermining her agreement to split it equally.\n\nTherefore, the husband's actions might be considered inconsiderate of his wife's preferences, even if he believes it's fair. The answer would likely be that he is the asshole because he's not respecting her terms once the agreement was made to split it equally. So, the answer is A.\n"
