My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is the asshole in this situation. The scenario is about a husband and wife disagreeing on how to split a pizza. The husband thinks he should get 60% because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife wants half each. He feels she's not considering their differences and plans to take the leftovers after she's done eating.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the core of the issue. The wife gave permission to order pizza because he found a coupon, but she wants an equal split. The husband argues that since he's taller and eats more, it's fair to give him more. But the problem is that they agreed to split it equally when she allowed him to order it. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's making a fair division based on their physical needs. However, the wife's point is about equality in the relationship. Even if he eats more, she might feel that sharing equally is a way to show fairness and compromise. The husband's plan to take her leftovers after she's done could be seen as undermining her right to have equal say, even if he ends up not eating all his share. \n\nAlso, he mentions he brings her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, but he orders cheap stuff from the kid's menu. Maybe he's trying to balance by taking her out, but if he's not allowing her to fully enjoy the sushi because he picks cheaper options, that could be a point of contention. However, in the pizza situation, the main issue is the initial agreement to split it 50-50. \n\nThe key here is whether mutual respect and compromise are being upheld. The wife's insistence on equality might be about feeling respected, not just the portion size. The husband's approach of letting her eat her half and then taking the rest could be seen as manipulative or not honoring the agreed-upon split. It's possible that the wife feels her needs as an equal partner are being ignored, even if he's not being selfish in the sense of hoarding food. \n\nSo, even though he has a rationale for needing more, the act of going against her agreed-upon terms could be perceived as being inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because he's not respecting her boundaries and the mutual agreement they made. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe in some cultures, splitting equally is expected regardless of appetite. The husband's plan to take the leftovers after she's done could be seen as unfair, as he's not honoring the initial agreement. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
