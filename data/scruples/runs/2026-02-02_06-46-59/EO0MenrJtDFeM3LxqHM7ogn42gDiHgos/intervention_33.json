My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a couple arguing over how to split a pizza. The husband wants to have 60% and the wife 40%, based on his larger size and higher food needs. She insists on a 50-50 split, citing equality. He plans to let her eat until she's full, which he thinks will leave him with the rest, but he's considering taking more if she doesn't finish her half. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the core issue. The main conflict is about fairness in the division of food. The husband's argument is based on physical needs, while the wife's is based on equality. The question is whether his reasoning justifies taking more than half.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many relationships, splitting things equally is seen as fair, regardless of individual needs. The wife's insistence on 50-50 might be about equality in the relationship, not just food. The husband's counter-argument is about his larger appetite, but does that override the principle of equality?\n\nAlso, the husband mentions other gestures, like taking her to sushi four times a year, where he encourages her to spend more. That might show he's willing to give her more in other contexts. However, the pizza issue is different because it's something he loves and orders less frequently. Maybe he feels it's a personal treat that he should have more of.\n\nBut then, the wife's point is about mutual respect and equality. If they are in a relationship, expecting equal sharing might be important for her to feel valued. The husband's plan to take more than half, even if she doesn't finish, could be seen as being selfish or not respecting her wishes. He's making a plan to circumvent her expectation, which might be the part that's problematic.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The husband has brought this up before, and she still insists. Maybe they need a compromise, but he's not willing to meet halfway. The wife's stance might be non-negotiable for her, and his response is to plan to go against it without discussing further. That could be where the issue lies.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? If fairness is about mutual agreement, and he's not respecting her terms, then maybe he is. Even if he's bigger, the 50-50 rule could be a boundary she's set. His plan to take more without her consent might be the problem. The answer might be A, he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her agreement and is planning to take more unilaterally.\n"
