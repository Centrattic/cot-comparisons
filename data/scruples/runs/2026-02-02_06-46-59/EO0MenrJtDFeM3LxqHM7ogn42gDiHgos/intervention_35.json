My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about pizza division between the author and his wife. The author wants a 60/40 split based on size and appetite, while the wife insists on 50/50. The author also mentions that they compromise in other areas, like sushi, where he lets her have the better stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the fairness of each perspective. The author's argument is about physical size and appetite. He's taller and bigger, so he eats more. But is that a valid reason to ask for a different split? The wife's stance is on equality, which is a common value in relationships. She might feel that splitting things equally is fair, regardless of physical differences.\n\nThen there's the context of their other interactions. The author makes an effort to let her enjoy sushi, even if it's more expensive. That shows he's willing to compromise. However, when it comes to pizza, he's pushing back. Maybe the key is whether the pizza is a special treat they both agree on, and if the wife's permission was conditional on splitting it 50/50.\n\nThe author's plan to take her portion after she's done eating might come off as sneaky or not respecting her wishes, even if he doesn't directly confront her. Honesty and mutual agreement are important in relationships. If he's going to take more without her consent, that could be seen as unfair or manipulative.\n\nAlso, the wife's insistence might be about feeling valued or included. Even if the author eats more, she might want to share the experience equally. The health and cost concerns are mentioned, but the author has a coupon and permission, so the issue isn't about that now.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, splitting things equally in a partnership is often expected, even if there's a difference in consumption. The author's argument could be seen as a personal preference versus a shared value. The wife's stance on equality is likely more about the relationship dynamic than the pizza itself.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's approach might be selfish, even if he's justifying it by his appetite. The wife's expectation of equality is reasonable, and the author's plan to circumvent her wishes could make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
