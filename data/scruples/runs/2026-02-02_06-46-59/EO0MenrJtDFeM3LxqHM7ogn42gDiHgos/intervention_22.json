My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation involving pizza sharing with his wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza using a coupon the wife gave permission for. The key issue is the division of the pizza. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The author mentions that he brings her sushi four times a year, so he's trying to be fair there. However, the wife still insists on equal pizza portions.\n\nThe author's plan is to let the wife eat her \"half\" first, then take what's left until he's full. That sounds a bit sneaky. If she eats less than half, he gets more. But he's aware she might not finish her half, leading to leftover pizza. He doesn't want to feel bad about it, even if she has to eat natto for breakfast instead.\n\nNow, considering fairness and equality in a relationship. The wife emphasizes equality, so she might feel that equal sharing is important. The author argues based on physical size, but that's subjective. The sushi example shows he caters to her preferences, which is good, but pizza is about his own preference. However, the wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so maybe he should respect her terms. Plus, the author's plan could be seen as undermining her wishes, even if he's not directly confrontational. It's about respecting mutual agreements and not exploiting the situation. The author's approach might come off as manipulative, even if he's not mean-spirited. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting her stated terms despite the reasoning.\n"
