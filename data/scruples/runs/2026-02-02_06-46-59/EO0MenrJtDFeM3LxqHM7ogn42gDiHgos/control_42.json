My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants 60% because he's taller, bigger, and eats more, while the wife wants half each. The author feels it's fair to take more since he eats more, but the wife insists on equal halves because of equality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author ordered pizza once a year, which is a special treat. He got permission from his wife using a coupon because she's concerned about health and cost. The wife wants equal portions, which she argues is fair as they are equals. The author, on the other hand, thinks that physical size and appetite should determine the split.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, fairness can be subjective. The wife might see equality as each person getting the same amount, regardless of their appetite. The author might think fairness is based on need or consumption. But the key point here is that the wife has already given permission for the pizza, maybe expecting an equal share. The author's plan to take more than half after letting her eat her fill could be seen as sneaky or not respecting her wishes. Even if he's eating more, he's not just taking more based on her eating but taking what she didn't finish. That might be where the conflict is. The author is planning to take advantage of her eating less than half, which might not be fair. The wife's insistence on half each is about equality, but the author is using a different metric for fairness. The question is whether the author is respecting the agreement (half each) or manipulating the situation by taking more after she eats. The answer might depend on the agreed-upon division before the pizza is eaten. If they agreed on half each, then the author's plan to take more might be wrong. If the agreement was just permission to buy, but not how to split, then maybe not. But since the wife explicitly wants half, and he's not honoring that, he might be in the wrong. So I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
