My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about how a couple divides a pizza they're ordering. The husband wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on a 50-50 split because they're supposed to be equals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon and it's otherwise expensive. He does order pizza four times a year, which isn't too often. Also, he takes her to sushi four times a year, and he lets her order the expensive ones, while he goes for the cheaper ones. That seems like he's making an effort to accommodate her preferences. \n\nThe main issue here is the division of the pizza. The husband argues that his size and appetite justify a larger portion, but the wife wants equality. The question is whether expecting more than half is fair. \n\nNow, in relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife's perspective is about equality in the relationship, which is a common value. The husband's argument is based on physical needs. However, the way he plans to take the leftover of her half after she's done eating might come off as manipulative or not respecting her wishes. \n\nThe key points to consider are mutual respect and communication. If they've discussed this before and the wife keeps insisting on half, maybe the husband should respect that to maintain harmony, even if he doesn't agree. But he's planning to go against her wishes by taking more, which might be seen as not respecting her boundaries. \n\nAlso, the part about her eating natto instead of leftover pizza the next day shows he's not planning to compromise, which could be seen as selfish. The wife's insistence might be about feeling equal, and his actions undermine that. \n\nSo, while the husband has a valid point about his appetite, his approach might be the problem. The wife's stance is about equality, which is a value they might have agreed upon. The husband's plan to take more without respecting her split could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her terms even though they're both adults and she's allowed the pizza in the first place.\n"
