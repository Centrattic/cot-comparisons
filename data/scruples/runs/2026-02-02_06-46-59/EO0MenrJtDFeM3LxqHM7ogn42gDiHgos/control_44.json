My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants a 60/40 split because they're taller and eat more, but the wife wants equal halves. The author mentions they sometimes order sushi, but the wife still insists on half the pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife allowed the pizza order because of the coupon, maybe trusting that it's a shared meal. The author loves pizza and orders it more than sushi. The wife might feel that since she's okay with him getting pizza, she should get an equal share. But the author is bigger and eats more. However, equality in relationships isn't just about physical needs; it's also about mutual respect and considerations. The wife's insistence on half might be about fairness, not just her own consumption. \n\nThe author's plan to take the remaining pizza after she's done is a bit sneaky. While it's true he eats more, taking from her share without consent could be seen as not respecting her wishes. The wife's argument is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. Even if he consumes more, she might feel that equal division is a principle they should follow. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be fair based on their body size and eating habits. They also bring her to sushi places, which she likes. But the issue is the pizza split. It's a small thing, but might represent a larger issue of respecting each other's preferences and agreements. \n\nThe wife might not mind the pizza as much as she minds not being treated equally. The author's approach of letting her eat her half first but then taking the rest could backfire if she feels her share is being taken away. Maybe communication is needed here, but the author is already entrenched in their view. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though he eats more, the principle of equal sharing in a relationship is important. The wife's expectation of equality should be respected, and the author's plan to take from her share without agreement might be seen as unfair. The fact that he's using her permission based on the coupon to justify his actions could be a stretch. Respecting her demand for half is part of mutual respect, even if he ends up not eating his full share.\n"
