My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author wants 60% for themselves and 40% for their wife, while the wife says it should be 50-50. The author argues that they are bigger and eat more, and that they both treat each other to their favorite foods four times a year.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of fairness in relationships. The wife says they're supposed to be equals, which is why she wants half. The author thinks their physical size and appetite should dictate the split. But in many relationships, equality in sharing costs or portions isn't always about splitting things exactly evenly. Sometimes it's about mutual respect and considering each other's preferences and circumstances.\n\nThe author mentions that they take the wife to sushi four times a year and she does the same with pizza. But the key difference is that the author orders cheap sushi while the wife gets the expensive stuff, whereas when the author gets pizza, the wife is supposed to take half. The author is trying to balance the enjoyment of each other's favorite foods, but the way they split the pizza seems to be a point of contention.\n\nIs it fair to base the pizza split purely on physical size and appetite? Maybe not, because that's a personal need, not necessarily a fair split in a relationship. The wife's insistence on half might be more about equality and compromise, even if she doesn't eat all of her share. The author's plan to take the leftover from her half after she's full could be seen as underhanded or not respecting her decision. \n\nThe author also mentions they don't plan to feel bad about their plan, which might indicate a lack of consideration for the wife's feelings. Even if the wife ends up not eating all her half, the author is being dishonest by taking it, which could hurt the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. If the wife has made it clear she wants half, the author should honor that even if it's not what they personally think is fair. The author's approach seems to prioritize their own wants over the wife's expectations, which could be seen as inconsiderate. So I think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
