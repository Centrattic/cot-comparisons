My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're a \"tit for tat\" asshole for expecting 60% of the pizza instead of a 50-50 split after their wife allowed them to get a pizza using a coupon. The key points here are the context of their agreement and the underlying reasons for the split.\n\nFirst, the wife gave permission to order the pizza because they found a coupon. The person mentions they do this four times a year, and in return, they take her to a nice sushi place four times a year, even though they prefer cheaper options. The wife wants half the pizza, citing equality, but the person feels that 60-40 is fair because they're taller and eat more.\n\nNow, considering fairness and mutual understanding. The coupon might have made the pizza more affordable, but the wife's main concern was the expense and health, so she allowed the order but set a condition for splitting. The person, however, is planning to circumvent that by taking the remaining half after she's done eating. This seems like they're not respecting her condition. Even if they eat more, the agreement was for 50-50, and by not adhering to that, they're being sneaky. The wife's request for half is about fairness in sharing the purchase she agreed to, not just about body size. The husband's justification is based on personal consumption, but the wife's perspective is about equal contribution, especially since she's allowing something she usually disapproves of. The husband's plan to let her eat first and then take the leftovers might leave her with less, but it's a way to get around her stipulation. This manipulation could be seen as the wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
