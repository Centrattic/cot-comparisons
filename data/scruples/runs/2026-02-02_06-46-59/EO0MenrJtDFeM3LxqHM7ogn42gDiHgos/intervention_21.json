My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with his wife. He ordered a large pizza using a coupon she gave him. He wants 60/40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but she insists on 50/50. He mentions he takes her to sushi places 4 times a year, but he orders cheap while she can have expensive. He plans to let her eat her \"half\" until she's full, then take the rest, even if she's left with natto for breakfast.\n\nHmm. First, the core issue is about fairness in splitting the pizza. The author argues for splitting based on body size and eating habits, while the wife wants equality. The author feels 60/40 is fair, but the wife doesn't agree. \n\nHe also mentions that they both have equal opportunities in other areas, like sushi. He takes her to sushi 4 times a year, but he orders cheap, she gets expensive. Maybe he's trying to balance it out? But then he's upset about the pizza split. \n\nThe key points here are about respect for each other's preferences and agreements. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza but expects half. The author is trying to push back, but maybe he's misinterpreting the agreement. If she gave him permission with the condition of splitting equally, he might be going against that. \n\nAlso, his plan to take what's left after she eats her half could be seen as manipulative. Letting her eat her half until she's full, but then he takes the rest, possibly leaving her with nothing. That might not be fair, even if she eats less. It's about respecting her terms. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If the wife wants 50/50, maybe the author should respect that, especially since she's already made sacrifices (like allowing pizza despite disliking it). The author's reasoning about body size and eating more could be his justification, but in a shared meal, splitting equally might be expected for equality. \n\nThe sushi example might not balance it out because those are different contexts. Sushi is a treat she gets more of, but pizza is something he gets to have 4 times a year. Maybe the author is overcompensating by trying to take more pizza. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed terms with his wife. Even if he thinks 60/40 is fair, she's set the condition for 50/50, and he's planning to circumvent that. That's being dishonest. So answer A.\n"
