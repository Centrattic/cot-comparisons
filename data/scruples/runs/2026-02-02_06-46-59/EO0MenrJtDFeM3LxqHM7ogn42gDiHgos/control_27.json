My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple arguing over how to split a pizza. The husband wants 60% for himself and 40% for his wife because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on a 50-50 split. The husband plans to let her eat until she's full (which he thinks will be less than half) and then take the remaining half for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife gave permission for the pizza after a coupon was found, so that part is okay. The husband's reasoning is based on physical size and appetite. However, the wife feels it's about equality. The husband also mentions that they both indulge in things the other prefers (he takes her to sushi, she allows pizza), so maybe there's a balance in their relationship.\n\nBut is it fair to argue that splitting food based on appetite is acceptable? The wife wants equality, which might be about fairness in their relationship. The husband's plan to take leftovers after she eats might be seen as manipulative or not respecting her wishes. Also, the idea of \"equality\" could mean different things\u2014maybe she feels that splitting equally is about equal respect, not about how much they eat. \n\nThe husband's approach could be seen as dismissive of her feelings if she wants an equal share. Even if he's bigger, the wife's preference for equality might be more about the relationship dynamic than the actual food quantity. The husband's plan to let her eat her half and then take the rest might be perceived as not honoring the agreement they made, leading to potential resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is being thoughtful by taking her to sushi, so he's trying to accommodate her preferences. However, the core issue is the pizza split. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect a different split based on appetite or if equality in the relationship means splitting equally regardless of appetite. \n\nIn many relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might feel that insisting on half is about maintaining balance, while the husband thinks it's about practicality. The husband's plan to not honor the 50-50 split after she eats might be seen as dishonest or not respecting her wishes. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether respecting the agreed-upon 50-50 split (as per the wife's expectation) is more important than the husband's practical reasoning. If the wife was given permission under the condition of splitting equally, then the husband going against that could be seen as the asshole. However, if the permission was just about buying the pizza without specifying the split, then the husband's approach might be justified. But since the wife has repeatedly demanded half, and the husband plans to go against it, that's where the issue lies. The husband's plan to take the remaining half after she eats could be seen as deceitful or not honoring the agreement, making him the asshole.\n"
