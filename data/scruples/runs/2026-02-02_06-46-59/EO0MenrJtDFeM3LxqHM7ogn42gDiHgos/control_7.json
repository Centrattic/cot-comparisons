My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about pizza division between the author and his wife.\n\nSo the author ordered a pizza, got permission from his wife using a coupon. He wants 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more. Wife insists on 50-50 for equality. The author plans to let her eat her half, but then take the leftovers after she's done, which would be less than half. He doesn't feel bad about making her eat natto instead of leftover pizza.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual agreement. The wife gave permission to get pizza, so that's a start. But the disagreement is on the split. The author argues based on his body size and eating more, while the wife wants equality. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife's stance is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The author is using a utilitarian approach, saying he needs more. But how does that affect their agreement? If he agreed to get pizza, maybe the compromise should be mutual. However, the author is planning to take advantage of her eating less than her half, which might be seen as unfair. \n\nAlso, the wife might feel that her agreement was for a shared meal, not one where he's going to take most. The author's plan to take leftovers after she's done could be seen as sneaky. But then again, maybe the wife's insistence on 50-50 is not considering practicalities. \n\nThe other part about sushi: he takes her there, but orders cheap plates himself while encouraging her to order expensive. That might show he's willing to compromise or spend more on her, but perhaps expects the same in return. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, he's using a \"fair\" split based on his needs, but the wife's argument is about equality. If they can't agree, maybe the author is being a bit selfish. But the wife's demand for 50-50 might not be considering their actual needs. However, the way the author plans to take more after she eats seems to undermine the agreement. \n\nIn the end, the author's approach could be seen as not respecting her terms once agreed. If he didn't agree to 50-50, maybe he shouldn't have ordered the pizza if he couldn't meet her condition. So maybe he's in the wrong because he's breaking their implicit agreement by taking more than half, even if he thinks it's fair.\n"
