My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. The author ordered pizza with a coupon and got his wife's permission. He argues that since he's bigger and eats more, a 60-40 split is fair. His wife insists on a 50-50 split because they're supposed to be equals.\n\nFirst, the wife's perspective: She allowed him to order pizza, maybe with the understanding that they'd share it equally. She might see fairness as equal portions regardless of size. The author's argument is about physical needs, but that's subjective. The wife's insistence on equality could stem from a different value system.\n\nThen there's the part about sushi. The author takes her to a nice place but eats cheaper items, while encouraging her to spend more on what she likes. That shows he's willing to adjust his own choices for her. But when it comes to pizza, he wants to adjust the portions in his favor. That might be seen as inconsistent.\n\nThe key issue is mutual respect and compromise. The wife might feel the 50-50 split is fair, and the author's plan to take more without her consent could be seen as dishonest. Even if he thinks she'll eat less, taking her share might make her feel disrespected. The author's approach to \"let her eat her fill\" sounds like an excuse to take more, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the wife's expectation of equality is valid, and the author isn't respecting her terms. The answer is likely A.\n"
