My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author wants to order a pizza, which his wife is against because it's unhealthy and expensive. He found a coupon and got her permission. But now, she wants half of the pizza, and he thinks a 60-40 split is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he orders cheap while she gets the expensive stuff. He plans to let her eat her half until she's full and then take the rest, even though that means she can't have leftovers.\n\nSo, the main issue is the fairness of the pizza split. The wife wants half, but the author thinks he should get more. The author's reasoning is based on their body size and consumption habits. However, the wife's stance is that they should be equal. \n\nI need to consider if it's reasonable to expect an equal split when the wife gave permission for the pizza purchase. The author might be overstepping by not respecting her terms for the split. Even if he eats more, once she agreed to the purchase, the distribution is part of the agreement. The author's plan to let her eat until full and then take the rest seems manipulative. He's using her acceptance of the coupon to justify taking more later, which could be seen as not honoring her initial terms. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that she can't have pizza leftovers for breakfast, which he doesn't feel bad about. This shows a lack of consideration for her potential disappointment or hunger. The wife's insistence on half might be about fairness or her own enjoyment, not just quantity. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is usually important. The author's approach might be seen as selfish because he's not respecting her wishes even though he got permission to get the pizza. The fact that they have different preferences (sushi vs. pizza) adds another layer. He allows her to get more expensive sushi, but he's not willing to share pizza in her way. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's argument about body size and eating more is valid, but sharing with a spouse often involves mutual respect. If she's okay with the coupon and the purchase, maybe the split should be flexible. However, the author is not negotiating but rather planning to take more after she's done. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's terms for the split. Even if he believes his reasoning is fair, in a relationship, honoring the other's wishes is important. His plan to take the remaining pizza after she's full could be seen as taking advantage of her agreement. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to double-check. \n\nAnother angle: if the wife gave permission under the condition of splitting equally, the author's refusal to do so might invalidate her consent. That would definitely be a problem. So, the author is acting against her conditions, which would make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
