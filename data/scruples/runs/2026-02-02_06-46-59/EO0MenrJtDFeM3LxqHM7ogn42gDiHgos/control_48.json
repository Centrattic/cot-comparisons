My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about pizza division between a husband and wife. The husband ordered a pizza after getting permission from his wife, but she wants half, while he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He's planning to take more than half if she doesn't eat all her half.\n\nFirst, the wife agreed to the pizza purchase because of the coupon. She might have expected an equal split as part of that agreement. The husband's reasoning is based on his body size and eating habits, but the wife values equality in sharing. The key here is mutual agreement. If the wife set the condition that it's half each, and he agreed to that as part of getting permission, then he's going against her terms. The husband's plan to take more than half without her knowledge could be seen as dishonest. Even if he's bigger, respecting her boundary is important in a relationship. Plus, he's using a \"take what's left\" strategy, which might be manipulative. The fact that he's not considering her feelings and is planning to make her eat natto instead of pizza the next day shows a lack of consideration for her. The sushi part shows he's thoughtful about her preferences, but this pizza situation is different. So, the husband is being inconsiderate by not respecting her agreed-upon share. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
