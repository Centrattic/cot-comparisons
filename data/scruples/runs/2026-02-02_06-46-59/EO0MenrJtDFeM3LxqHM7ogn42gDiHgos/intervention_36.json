My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves pizza sharing between a husband and wife.\n\nFirst, the husband ordered a pizza using a coupon, and his wife allowed it. He wants 60% for himself because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. He argues that their size difference justifies unequal portions, even though he brings her to sushi places and lets her order expensive items. The wife thinks equality means equal shares.\n\nI need to determine if the husband is wrong. The key points are fairness in their relationship. The wife's stance is about equality, but the husband is using physical size and eating habits to justify unequal division. However, the wife has given permission for the pizza because of the coupon and understanding his preference. The husband's counter is that he's being fair based on their bodies, but the wife sees it as unequal treatment.\n\nThe husband's plan is to let her eat her half first, then take from it if he's still hungry. This might leave some leftover pizza, which the wife can't have. It seems like he's trying to assert his point by manipulating the portions. The wife wants equality, but the husband is prioritizing his own needs over her expectations of fairness. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and compromise are important. Even if the husband eats more, insisting on 60-40 might be seen as disregarding her feelings about equality. The wife's insistence on 50-50 could be about feeling valued and respected, not just about the amount of food. The husband's approach might be seen as selfish, even if he has a logical reason. So, the answer might be that he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her perspective on fairness in their shared meals.\n"
