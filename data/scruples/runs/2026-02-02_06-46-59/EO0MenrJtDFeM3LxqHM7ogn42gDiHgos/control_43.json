My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author wants a 60-40 split because they're taller and eat more, but the wife insists on half each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness. The wife gave permission for the pizza, so she's on board with having it. The author's reasoning is based on physical size and appetite. But in relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might see equal sharing as fair, regardless of differences in appetite. The author is planning to take more than half by letting the wife eat until satisfied first, which might be a way to get around the 50-50 split without being direct.\n\nThe author also mentions they take the wife to a nice sushi place, but they order cheap plates while encouraging her to spend more. There's an imbalance there too. The wife might feel that the pizza split is a way to balance things, even if the author's logic is about consumption. The key point is mutual respect and compromise. The wife's insistence on equal shares could be about feeling valued equally, not just about food quantity. The author's plan to take the remaining pizza after she eats might leave the wife with less, which could be seen as not respecting her agreement. So, maybe the author is being inconsiderate by not compromising. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because the wife's perspective on equality is important, and the author is prioritizing their own needs without sufficient respect for her feelings of fairness.\n"
