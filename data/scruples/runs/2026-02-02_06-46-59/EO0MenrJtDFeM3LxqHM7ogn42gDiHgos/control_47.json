My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between him and his wife. He ordered the pizza using a coupon his wife allowed him to use. The key point is the division of the pizza. The wife wants half each, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to a nicer sushi place where he encourages her to spend more on better sushi, but he still insists on his pizza share.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so she's not against it entirely. But she wants an equal split. The author is arguing that his body size and appetite justify a larger portion. On the other hand, the wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in sharing, not just food. \n\nBut then, the author's plan is to let her eat her half until she's full, and then take the rest of her half. That seems a bit sneaky and maybe disregards her wishes. Even if she's not eating as much, he's going against her stated preference. The wife might feel disrespected because she wanted an equal split. Also, the author's reasoning about equality being \"we are supposed to be equals\" could be a feminist perspective, but he's countering that with physical needs. \n\nBut is it fair to impose his own eating habits on her? If she's okay with the pizza, but wants half each, even if he could eat more, she's the one who set the terms. Maybe the issue is about respecting mutual agreements. The author is allowed to have the pizza, but the terms of sharing are set by her. So if he goes against her wishes, even if he's technically allowed to have it, he's violating the agreement. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to take the leftover of her half might lead to her having to eat natto instead. It's a bit of a punishment or consequence she didn't agree to. So the author is not just splitting it differently but also maybe manipulating the situation to his advantage. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife might see the equal split as a way to ensure both get what they want, even if one eats more. The author is prioritizing his own needs over her stated preference, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's terms for sharing the pizza, even if his reasoning is about his appetite. The key issue is mutual respect and agreed-upon terms. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
