My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the pizza dispute is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author wants to split the pizza 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, but his wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest, even if she's not full.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza with a coupon, which shows she's okay with the expense. She might have agreed to the order but still has conditions about the split. The author argues that body size and appetite justify unequal division. But the wife's stance is that equality is important, even if their appetites differ. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife's insistence on equal sharing could be about fairness rather than just the physical aspect. Even if he eats more, in a relationship, equal sharing might be a way to show consideration. The author's plan to take the remaining pizza after she eats her half seems to undermine her decision. It might come off as manipulative or not respecting her wishes. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he takes her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, but he orders cheap plates. That could be a point where he's not being fair in that scenario either, but the main issue is the pizza split. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on practicality (appetite and body size), but relationships often involve compromise. The wife's expectation of equality might be a non-negotiable for her. The author's plan to go ahead and do what he wants, despite her wishes, could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo in terms of being in the wrong, the author is not respecting the agreed-upon split his wife has set. Even if he believes his reasoning is valid, if the wife has made it clear that she expects half, then going against that without discussion might be the problem. The author is not just taking more, but also planning to ignore her declared share. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's terms for the pizza split, even if his reasoning is about appetite. In a relationship, mutual respect and compromise are important, and the wife's expectation of equal sharing should be honored unless they can find a middle ground through discussion.\n"
