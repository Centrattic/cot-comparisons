My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon she gave them, and they want to take 60% because they're bigger and eat more. The wife wants half each.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and equality in their relationship. The author argues that their physical size and appetite justify a larger share, but the wife insists on equal halves. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the wife's perspective: she might value equality and not want to feel like her input isn't respected. Even if the author eats more, she might see the act of sharing as a mutual agreement. The author's past behavior, like taking her to a nice sushi place but ordering for her, could be a factor. Maybe the wife feels the author doesn't respect her preferences in other areas, so this is about more than just pizza.\n\nThen the author's plan to take the remaining pizza after the wife is full seems like a way to get what they want without being fair. That might come off as sneaky or not considering her feelings. The wife's insistence on half could be her way of asserting her autonomy or health concerns, especially in a place where pizza is expensive and unhealthy. \n\nThe author's argument for fairness based on appetite might not align with the wife's expectations of equality. Relationships often involve compromise, and the author might be overstepping by not honoring the agreed-upon split. Even if they think 60-40 is fair, the wife's repeated demand suggests she values equal sharing. \n\nAlso, the mention of the author encouraging her to order expensive sushi while they choose cheaper options might imply they don't fully respect her choices there. So the wife's stance on pizza could be part of a larger pattern where she feels her preferences aren't considered. \n\nThe author's plan to take her share after she's full feels like they're not being honest and might be causing her to eat something she doesn't like (natto) because of leftover pizza. That's not good for the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong because they're not respecting the wife's request for equality, even if they think their own reasoning is fair. The wife's health and equality concerns are valid, and the author's approach might be manipulative.\n"
