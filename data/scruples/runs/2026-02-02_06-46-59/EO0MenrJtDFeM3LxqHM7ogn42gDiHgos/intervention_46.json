My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple arguing over splitting a pizza. The husband wants to split it 60-40 in his favor because he's bigger and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50. The author plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest, even if that means she has to eat natto the next day instead of leftovers.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural context. In Japan, which the user mentioned, there's a strong emphasis on harmony and politeness. Maybe the wife's expectation of equality is part of that. The husband's argument is based on physical differences, but equality in relationships isn't always about splitting things equally. It's about mutual respect and consideration.\n\nThe author's plan sounds a bit manipulative. If he lets her eat her half first, then takes the rest, he's not being transparent. The wife might feel cheated when she realizes he's taking more. The husband's reasoning is that she'll eat less than half, but that's assuming. Maybe she does eat all her half, and then he's taking from her leftovers. That's disrespectful. Also, he's not considering her feelings; he's justifying it by saying he won't feel bad, which is a red flag.\n\nThe husband also brings up that he takes her to sushi places, but he orders cheap items while she gets expensive ones. Maybe he's trying to balance things out, but the pizza issue is a different context. The wife might see the pizza as a shared meal where they should both enjoy it equally, regardless of quantity. The husband's approach seems to undermine her autonomy in deciding how much she wants to eat. It's about fairness versus equality. Even if he eats more, forcing her to take what she's given without considering her actual needs or desires could be problematic.\n\nSo, the husband is not in the right because he's not respecting his wife's wishes and is being manipulative. His plan to take leftovers after she eats is sneaky and not considerate. The answer should be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
