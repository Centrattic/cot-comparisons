My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon that the wife gave permission for, and he wants a 60-40 split because he's taller and eats more. The wife wants half each. The question is whether he's being reasonable or an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed him to order pizza, so there's no issue there. The author points out that he's bigger and eats more, so he argues for taking a larger portion. On the surface, it might seem fair, but there's more to it. The wife wants half, and the author is planning to take more than half by letting her eat until she're full, which he expects to be less than half, and then taking the rest. That's a bit manipulative, maybe? Like, he's not actually splitting it 50-50 but using her initial half as an excuse to take more.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year. But he orders cheap plates off the kids' menu, even though he knows she likes the expensive ones. So he's being kind in taking her to a place she likes, but then he's not letting her order what she really wants. Maybe there's a pattern here where he's trying to balance things but in a way that's not entirely fair.\n\nThe wife's argument is about equality. She might feel that sharing a meal should be equal, regardless of their sizes. The author is challenging that by saying physical size justifies a different split. But is that a valid argument? Maybe not, because equality in relationships isn't always about equal portions but about mutual respect and compromise. The fact that he's using her own declaration of half the pizza to take more could be seen as taking advantage of her, even if it's just a pizza.\n\nAlso, the plan to let her have her fill first and then take the rest of her half sounds like he's trying to justify taking more without directly confronting her. That might not be the best approach. Instead of being upfront about the split, he's using a strategy that could make her feel like she's not getting her fair share. The wife might feel disrespected if he's not honoring the agreement she thought was set.\n\nIn terms of the cultural context, in Japan, where the story is set, maybe there's a different approach to sharing food. But the story doesn't specify any cultural norms, so I shouldn't assume that. The main issue is the fairness and respect in their relationship. If they had a prior agreement, the author should respect that. If not, maybe they need to discuss it more openly instead of using a tactic that could be seen as sneaky.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not necessarily in the wrong, but his approach might be. He's trying to get a better deal for himself under the guise of fairness. The wife's insistence on half might be a principle, but the author's plan to undermine that could be the problem. Therefore, the answer might be A, as he's not respecting her preference and is being manipulative.\n"
