My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pizza split between the author and his wife. The wife says half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife has given him permission to buy the pizza with a coupon, but he's planning to take more than half.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife allowed him to order pizza, which shows some compromise. She wants equal halves, maybe as a fair division. The author argues that his body size justifies a larger portion. The question is whether his argument is valid or if he's being unfair.\n\nIn relationships, equality vs. fairness is a common topic. The wife might see equal sharing as equitable, while the husband thinks adjusting for their different needs is fair. But the wife's insistence on half could be about equality in contribution or other factors. The author mentions that he also takes her to sushi, but in a way that he's not fully appreciating her preferences, ordering cheap plates while encouraging her to get expensive ones. That might show some imbalance in his approach.\n\nHowever, the main issue is the pizza split. The author is planning to take more than agreed, using a strategy where he lets her eat her half first, then takes from it. That seems manipulative. The wife might feel disrespected if he's not following through on the agreement she expects. The fact that he's not apologetic about making her eat natto instead of leftover pizza suggests he's not considering her feelings or the agreement they made. \n\nSo, while there might be arguments on both sides, the author's plan to undermine the agreed-upon split (half each) by taking more without her consent could be seen as the wrong approach. The wife's request for equal portions might be about equality, and the husband's response is disrespectful to her wishes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
