My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband wanting to order a pizza and splitting it with his wife. The wife says half is hers, but the husband thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The husband also mentions that he brings her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he orders cheap kid's plates while she can have the expensive ones.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is the division of the pizza. The wife wants an equal split, while the husband thinks it should be based on their appetites. The husband is using his physical size and eating habits as justification. But the wife argues for equality as a partnership. \n\nThe husband also brings up the sushi outings. He claims he's being fair by taking her to a nice place, but he himself orders cheap food, which might indicate he's not valuing her preferences equally. He encourages her to take the expensive options, but maybe that's just so he can have a reason to justify his own pizza portion? It's a bit of a red herring perhaps.\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about exact equality. It's more about mutual respect and consideration. The wife's stance is about equality in sharing, while the husband is arguing based on individual needs. The husband's plan to take more after she's had her half might seem underhanded. Also, the fact that he's planning not to feel bad about it suggests he's not respecting her feelings, even if his logic seems pragmatic.\n\nAdditionally, the husband is making a conscious choice to indulge in pizza four times a year, which he acknowledges is against her preferences. The wife gave permission because of the coupon, but maybe she expected a respectful sharing. The husband's insistence on 60-40 might not be respecting her comfort level, even if she doesn't like pizza herself. It's possible she's allowing it for his happiness but expects a mutual sharing.\n\nThe husband's approach could be seen as using logic to justify taking more, which might come off as selfish. The wife's position is that they're equals, so splitting in half is fair. The husband's argument is based on physical needs, but that's not always a valid reason in shared meals. Relationships often require compromise, and the husband's plan to take more after she's had her half could be seen as manipulative.\n\nAnother angle: the husband is using the sushi outings as a counterpoint, but if he's not valuing her preferences there (ordering kid's plates), maybe that's another area of imbalance. The sushi outings might not be a fair trade-off if he's not actually sharing the experience equally. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is not respecting his wife's boundaries and expectations for equality. His reasoning about body size and eating habits is a way to justify taking more, but it might not be fair in a relationship context where mutual respect is key. His plan to take her leftover pizza also shows a lack of consideration for her wishes. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong.\n"
