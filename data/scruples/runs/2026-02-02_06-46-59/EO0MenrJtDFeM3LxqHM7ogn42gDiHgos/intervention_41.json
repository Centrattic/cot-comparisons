My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife. The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon, and his wife says he should take half and she half. He argues that he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. The wife insists on equal halves as they're supposed to be equals. The husband also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he prefers the kids' menu, and she likes the expensive stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The wife gave permission to order pizza because of the coupon, so that's a point where the husband is respecting her wishes. But now the issue is the division. The wife's reasoning is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The husband's counter-argument is based on physical size and appetite. \n\nThe key points to consider: Is expecting equal halves a reasonable request? The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in sharing, not necessarily about appetite. Even if one person eats more, splitting equally can be a way to ensure both get a fair share without arguing. The husband's plan to let her eat her fill first, which he knows will be less than half, and then take the leftovers is a bit sneaky. It might be seen as undermining her wishes, even if he's not directly violating the coupon agreement. \n\nAlso, the husband's claim about sushi: he takes her to a nice place but orders from the kids' menu. If he's doing that, maybe the wife feels he's not fully reciprocating when it comes to pizza. She might be trying to balance it by asking for equal shares. The husband's approach of taking 60% seems self-centered and doesn't consider her perspective. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, in Japan, sharing food equally might be more common, but that's not the main issue here. The main issue is mutual respect and consideration. The wife's request for half the pizza is a fair way to ensure both get something they like, even if only one of them eats more. The husband's plan to take more after she gets full is a bit of a passive-aggressive tactic. \n\nSo, the husband is trying to justify taking 60% based on his physical needs, but the wife's point about equality is also valid. The husband's behavior might be seen as not respecting her agreement, even if it's about how they split the food. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the wife's request for equal halves is a reasonable expectation in a relationship where they're supposed to be equals, and the husband is circumventing that by taking more after she eats her share. The sushi analogy doesn't fully align because it's about different preferences, but the pizza split is about mutual agreement. The husband's actions are disrespectful and manipulative, making him the asshole.\n"
