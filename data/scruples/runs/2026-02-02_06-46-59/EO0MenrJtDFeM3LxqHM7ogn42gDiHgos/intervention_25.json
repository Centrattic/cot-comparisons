My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about dividing a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants 60% for himself because he's taller and eats more, but his wife insists on a 50-50 split. The author is planning to take more than half even if she agreed to split it, which he's not admitting to her.\n\nFirst, the wife allowed him to order the pizza with a coupon, so she's already okay with having pizza for dinner. The author argues that since he eats more, 60-40 is fair. But the wife's stance is about equality. The question is whether fairness here is based on individual needs or equal sharing as partners.\n\nThe author mentions that they both take each other to their preferred restaurants, so it's a mutual exchange. However, he's planning to take more than half the pizza without her knowing, which seems underhanded. Even if he thinks it's fair, manipulating the situation without her consent could be seen as deceitful. Also, he's not respecting her stated boundary, which is that she wants half. The fact that he's going to take more after she eats her fill, even if it's less than half, is a bit sneaky. The wife might feel disrespected if she finds out. So maybe the author is being inconsiderate of her feelings, even if he thinks he's being reasonable. The key point is whether fairness is subjective here, but the act of not being honest about the plan might make him the asshole.\n"
