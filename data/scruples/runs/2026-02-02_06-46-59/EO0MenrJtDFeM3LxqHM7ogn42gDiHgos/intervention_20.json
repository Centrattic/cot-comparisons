My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants 60% for himself because he's taller and eats more, while the wife insists on 50-50. The author has tried to reason with her before but she won't budge. He plans to let her eat her half, then take the rest if she leaves some. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The wife allowed him to order pizza because he found a coupon, so maybe she's already made a compromise. The idea of equal shares might come from a sense of fairness, even if their appetites differ. The author is suggesting a different ratio based on physical size, but maybe the wife feels that equality in sharing is more important, regardless of individual needs. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, but he orders cheaper items while she gets the expensive ones. This might imply that he's already making some sacrifices for her, but the pizza issue is a point of contention. However, the key here is mutual agreement and respect. If the wife is set on splitting it evenly, the author's plan to take more after she eats her half could be seen as sneaky or disrespectful. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The wife's stance is based on equality, and the author is trying to assert his different needs. In relationships, compromise is important. If the wife is insisting on 50-50, perhaps the author should respect that, even if he ends up eating less. His plan to take more after she eats might not be fair to her, as she might end up not getting her full share if he takes from what's left. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as undermining her wishes and not respecting the agreed-upon split. Even if he feels his needs are different, he's choosing to ignore her preference. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
