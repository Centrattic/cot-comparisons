My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting a pizza between him and his wife. He ordered pizza after getting a coupon, and his wife agreed as long as he splits it 50-50. But he thinks 60-40 is fairer because he's bigger and eats more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their agreement. The wife gave permission with the condition that it's split evenly. The author is now considering not following that agreement. Even though he's bigger, does that mean the agreed-upon split is invalid? Maybe the wife's insistence on half is about equality in sharing, not just physical size. They might have different food preferences\u2014like he likes pizza more, she might not as much. Maybe she's okay with eating less if she's not as hungry, but the principle of equal sharing is important to her.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they both take each other out to their preferred meals. So maybe the pizza and sushi outings are balanced, but the pizza split is a point of contention. The author's plan is to let her eat her half, then take leftovers from her portion. That could be seen as undermining her choice and not respecting the agreement. Even if he's not hungry anymore, taking her leftovers without her consent might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Has the author tried to explain his reasoning to her, or is he just going to ignore her request? If they've discussed this before and she still wants half, maybe her needs are more about fairness in the relationship. The author might be prioritizing his own preferences over mutual respect. The wife's argument is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The husband's reasoning is practical (body size), but that might not outweigh the importance of mutual agreement.\n\nSo, the husband is not necessarily wrong in his reasoning, but he's choosing to disregard an agreement they made. That could make him the asshole because breaking an agreement without discussion can be seen as disrespectful. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a valid argument for B. If the wife is being unreasonable by not considering his needs, but the story says they have different preferences and he accommodates her with sushi. So maybe the wife is right to expect fairness in the split she agreed to. The husband's plan to take her leftovers is a bit sneaky and disrespectful. So AITA says the author is the asshole. Answer A.\n"
