My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a pizza split between them and their wife. The author wants 60% for themselves because they're bigger and eat more, but the wife insists on 50-50. They also mention that they bring her to sushi places four times a year, but they prefer cheaper options, while she likes expensive ones. The author plans to let the wife eat her half, but after she's done, they'll eat the leftover until they're full, even if she has to eat natto the next day instead of leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife has allowed the author to order pizza using a coupon because she knows he likes it as a taste of home. The author is making an effort to take her to sushi places, showing some consideration. The issue is the division of the pizza.\n\nThe author argues that a 60-40 split is fair based on their body size and appetite. The wife, on the other hand, wants equal halves, emphasizing equality in the relationship. The key here is whether expecting equal portions is reasonable despite differing appetites. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might feel that since the author is indulging in something she's not keen on, they should share equally. The author might see it as practical, given they eat more. However, the author's plan to take the leftovers from the wife's half after she's done might be seen as underhanded. Instead of discussing and agreeing on a different split, they're planning to take advantage of the situation. \n\nAlso, the author's justification for ordering a large pizza is that they like eating a lot, not for value. This suggests they might not need to compromise. But the wife's insistence on half could be about feeling that her permission is respected equally. Maybe she's okay with the cost if they split it, but the author is prioritizing their own preference. \n\nThe fact that the author brings up body size and appetite as reasons might not be the best approach. Relationships often involve compromise, and maybe the wife's request is more about feeling equal rather than the actual amount eaten. The author's plan to take leftovers could be perceived as not respecting her autonomy in the decision. \n\nSo, while the author's reasoning is logical, the approach might be seen as not considering the wife's perspective. The act of secretly taking her leftovers without negotiation could be the asshole move here. The wife's insistence on half might be about the principle of shared expenses or equal consideration, not the physical amount. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not finding a middle ground or respecting her terms even if they differ from their needs.\n"
