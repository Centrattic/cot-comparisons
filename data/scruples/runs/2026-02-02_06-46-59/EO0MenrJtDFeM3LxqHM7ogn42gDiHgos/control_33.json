My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for expecting more than half the pizza. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author wants to order a pizza using a coupon, which his wife allowed. He's bigger and eats more, so he thinks a 60-40 split is fair. His wife insists on a 50-50 split because of equality. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, even though he prefers cheaper options. The main conflict is about dividing the pizza. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of fairness here. The wife's argument is based on equality\u2014each person gets half. The author argues based on their body size and appetite. But is it fair to base meal portions on physical size? In many relationships, people might split things equally unless there's a specific reason not to. However, the author is using that as a justification. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's ordering the pizza because he loves the taste from his home country. His wife is allowing it despite her concerns about health and expense. So maybe the wife is already making a concession by letting him get pizza, and he's pushing back on her terms for splitting it. \n\nThe author plans to let her eat her fill, which he assumes will be less than half, and then eat the rest. This seems like he's not actually respecting her half, even if she eats less. It might come off as manipulative or not honoring the agreement. \n\nAnother angle: compromise. The wife is asking for half, and the author is refusing. If they can't agree, maybe there's another solution, like him taking a bigger portion of something else in return. But the author doesn't seem willing to compromise here. \n\nHe also brings up the sushi outings as a point of fairness. He takes her to nice places, even if he doesn't enjoy it as much. Maybe this is a way to show he's making sacrifices, but the pizza is a personal preference. However, the wife isn't getting the same in return. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to respect her decision once she allowed the pizza order? If she said half is hers, maybe he should follow through. Even if he eats more, the agreement is about sharing. The author's plan to take the leftovers after she's done might be seen as undermining her right to her half. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for 60-40 is based on his own needs, but does that justify not respecting an equal split? In relationships, sometimes equal division is about fairness in sharing, not just physical needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreement his wife made, even if he has a different view on fairness. The wife's insistence on equality could be important to her sense of fairness in the relationship. The author's plan to take her leftovers without her consent might be seen as selfish, even if he's bigger.\n"
