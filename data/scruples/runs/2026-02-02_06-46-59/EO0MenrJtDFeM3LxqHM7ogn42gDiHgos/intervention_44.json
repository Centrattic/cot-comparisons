My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple splitting a pizza. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while his wife wants exactly half each. He mentions that he orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places the same number, but he usually gets the cheaper kids' menu and encourages her to get the more expensive ones. The wife still wants half the pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is being unfair. The wife asked for half because they are supposed to be equals. The author is trying to justify a different split based on body size and consumption. But maybe the issue is about respecting the agreed-upon terms. The wife gave permission only if he ordered a large, which he did, but the split is another matter. He used a coupon to make it more affordable, but the wife's condition is half each. If he agreed to that when he got permission, then going back on it could be the problem. He also mentions he'll take her leftovers after she eats her \"self-declared half,\" which might be manipulative. The key points are consent, fairness, and mutual respect. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't stick to the agreement about splitting it equally. Even if he eats more, the wife might value equality in sharing, and he's trying to circumvent her wishes. Plus, the part where he takes her leftovers without her consent could be seen as underhanded. So the answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
