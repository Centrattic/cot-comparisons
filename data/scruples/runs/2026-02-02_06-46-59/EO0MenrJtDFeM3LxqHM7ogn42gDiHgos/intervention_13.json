My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants 60% to themselves because they're bigger and eat more, while the wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The author also mentions they take her to sushi places, but she still wants the pizza split equally. They plan to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The wife gave permission to order the pizza with a coupon, so that's agreed. The author's reasoning is based on their body size and eating habits. However, the wife's stance is about equality. The author is planning to take more than agreed, which could be seen as going back on a compromise. \n\nThe author mentions that they take her to sushi, but she still wants the pizza split equally. Maybe the wife feels that even though he's doing something for her, she should have equal say in the pizza. The part where the author plans to take leftovers after she's done could be seen as underhanded. Even if the wife eats less than half, taking her leftovers might violate the initial agreement. \n\nAlso, in relationships, fairness isn't always strictly about quantity. The wife might value equality in how things are shared, even if their appetites differ. The author's argument is practical, but the wife's is about mutual respect and partnership. The author might be seen as not respecting the agreed-upon arrangement, which could be the root of the issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they agreed to split it 50-50, taking more than that could be a breach of that agreement, even if they think their reasoning is fair. The answer might be A (Yes), because breaking the agreed split could be seen as disrespectful, even if the reasoning is based on personal needs.\n"
