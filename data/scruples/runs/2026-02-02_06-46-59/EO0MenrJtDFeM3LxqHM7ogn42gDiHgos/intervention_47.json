My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife.\n\nThe author ordered a pizza using a coupon, and the wife agreed to let him buy it. But she wants half, while the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The author mentions that they both do things for each other, like sushi and pizza. The wife wants equal halves, but the author plans to take more than half after she eats her fill. The author also says he won't feel bad if she has to eat natto instead of leftover pizza.\n\nFrom the story, the wife agreed to the purchase, so the author isn't doing anything against her wishes. The issue is the split. The author argues that his body size justifies a larger share. The wife values equality, which is a common cultural value. The author's plan to take more than half after she's done seems manipulative, even if he's not forcing her to eat it. However, he's not taking it by force; he's letting her have her fill first. The key here is consent and mutual respect. The wife's demand for equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. The author's reasoning is based on personal needs, but in a relationship, compromise is usually expected. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting her preference for equality, even if his own reasoning is logical. The answer would depend on whether fairness in a relationship requires equal sharing despite differing individual needs.\n"
