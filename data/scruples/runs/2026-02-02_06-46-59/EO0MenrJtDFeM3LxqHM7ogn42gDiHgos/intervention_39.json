My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong in a situation involving pizza division with their wife.\n\nFirst, the husband wants to order pizza, which his wife is okay with because he found a coupon. He's planning to order a large pizza, not for value but because he likes to eat a lot. The wife insists on splitting it 50-50, but the husband thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife keeps pushing for equal halves despite previous discussions.\n\nThe husband also mentions that he takes her to sushi 4 times a year, but he orders cheaper kid's plates, while encouraging her to get the more expensive ones. He plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the leftovers, even if she has to have natto for breakfast. He's not feeling bad about it.\n\nSo, the key points are about fairness and respect in the relationship. The wife values equality and might see the pizza as a shared expense, hence the equal split. The husband's reasoning is based on his physical needs, but the wife's perspective is about equality and perhaps shared responsibilities. The husband's plan to take leftovers after she's done could be seen as manipulative or not respecting her wishes. \n\nAlso, the sushi example: he's giving her expensive sushi but only orders cheap for himself. That might be a sign of generosity, but maybe the wife still feels the pizza should be split equally. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. The husband is disregarding his wife's preference, even if he's been told before. His plan to take the leftovers after she eats might be seen as undermining her. Even if he's bigger, the wife's insistence on equality might be a non-negotiable for her. The husband's approach could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her wishes and is being self-serving despite her concerns. Answer A.\n"
