My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about pizza sharing between a husband and wife. The husband ordered a pizza, which his wife is okay with if he uses a coupon. But she wants half, and he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on equality, and the husband plans to take the remaining after she's done. \n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The wife agreed to the pizza because he found a coupon and ordered a large for his preference, not just value. But she's asking for half, maybe because of the expense in Japan, and the idea of equality in the relationship. The husband is pushing for a different ratio, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nHe also mentions other times he does things for her, like taking her to sushi. But that doesn't necessarily negate the issue here. The wife's insistence on half might be about feeling respected, not just the quantity. The husband's plan to take the leftovers after she's done could make her feel taken advantage of, even if she eats less. \n\nSo, the question is whether it's wrong to expect a 60-40 split. Relationships often require compromise. If the wife is uncomfortable with the idea of not getting exactly half, even if he agrees to a different ratio, that's her boundary. The husband might be in the wrong by not respecting her request for equality, especially if she's already given in by allowing him to order pizza. The idea of \"half\" might be a way to ensure both feel their needs are met equally, not based on physical size. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A, as he's not respecting her insistence on equality despite their differences in appetite. But I should check if there's nuance I missed. The husband's reasoning is about body size and eating more, but if the wife has a different perspective, maybe she values equal sharing regardless. So, the husband's plan to take the other half after she's done might be considered selfish or not considering her feelings. So, AITA, the answer is A.\n"
