My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon, got permission from his wife, but they disagree on how to split it. He wants 60-40 because he's bigger and eats more, while she wants exactly half. He also mentions other times they do things for each other, like sushi.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are about fairness, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife is asking for equal halves, while the author believes a different split is fair. He's planning to take more after she eats her half, possibly leaving her with less if she's full. \n\nThe author's justification is based on their physical differences and metabolism. However, in relationships, equality isn't always about physical needs but also about mutual respect and compromise. The wife might feel that her preference for equality is being dismissed, even if it's not the most efficient split in terms of consumption. \n\nHe also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, where he's more frugal. That might be a point in his favor, but the core issue is the pizza division. The author's plan to take her share after she's full could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful. \n\nThe question is whether the author's expectation of a 60-40 split is unreasonable. While it's a personal choice, the way he approaches it\u2014by not directly communicating and instead taking from her portion\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. The wife's insistence on equality might stem from a desire for fairness in their shared expenses and meals, even if it's not perfectly aligned with their consumption. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's perspective and is using a somewhat sneaky method to get more. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
