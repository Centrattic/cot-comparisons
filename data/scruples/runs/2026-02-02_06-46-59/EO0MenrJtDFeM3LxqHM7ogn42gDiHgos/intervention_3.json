My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband wants to eat 60% of the pizza because he's taller and eats more, but his wife insists on splitting it 50-50. The husband plans to let her eat her fill first, but since he thinks she'll eat less than half, he'll take the remaining from her half. He wants to know if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm, first, the wife gave permission to order pizza because of a coupon and the cost in Japan. The husband ordered a large pizza not for value but because he likes to eat a lot. The wife's argument is about equality, saying they should be equal in sharing. The husband's counter is based on his physical size and dietary needs. \n\nBut wait, equality in relationships doesn't always mean splitting everything 50-50. Sometimes it's about mutual respect and understanding each other's preferences. The wife might be okay with the husband having more pizza if it's a rare treat, especially since he also brings her to sushi places where she can indulge in her preferences. \n\nThe husband's plan to take from her half after she's had her fill seems a bit underhanded. Even though he thinks she'll eat less, he's not being upfront. Maybe this could lead to resentment. The wife might feel cheated because she's sacrificing her preference for the husband's, but he's not reciprocating. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about his body size might not be the best approach. Everyone's appetite can vary, and using that as a justification for a 60-40 split could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Maybe they need to communicate better. The husband could offer to order two different pizzas or adjust the size next time, but taking from her share without her knowledge isn't fair. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband is being inconsiderate of his wife's expectations and the agreement they made. Even if he has a good point about his body size, the way he's handling it undermines mutual respect. The answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
