My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The wife says half is hers, but the author thinks a 60-40 split is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The author mentions that they order pizza about 4 times a year, and he also takes her to a fancy sushi place 4 times a year, but he eats from the kid's menu while she gets the expensive stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the split. The wife wants an equal split, but the author argues based on body size and appetite. Is expecting equal shares inherently unfair? Or is it reasonable for the author to think that since he's bigger, he should get more?\n\nThen there's the aspect of their relationship dynamics. The author has a coupon and got permission to order the pizza. The wife's concern about health and cost is mentioned. The author's plan is to let the wife eat her fill, which he assumes will be less than half, and then he'll take the remaining. But this could lead to the wife feeling her share is being taken, even if she's done eating. That might be a point of contention.\n\nAlso, the author's approach to sushi\u2014taking her to a nice place but ordering cheaper items for himself. Is that a form of reciprocity? Or is it just the author's preference? It might show that he's trying to accommodate her tastes, but that's a different context than the pizza situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being reasonable in his 60-40 split. The wife's insistence on equality might be about fairness in the relationship, not just physical needs. The author's plan to take her leftover pizza after she's done could be seen as inconsiderate. Maybe the wife wants the assurance of having her own share without worrying about the author taking more after she's eaten.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, his logic about appetite and body size is practical. But relationships often involve compromise and respecting each other's preferences beyond just physical needs. If the wife values equality in the split, then going against that might be seen as not respecting her wishes. The author's approach to the sushi might show he's willing to be generous in other areas, but the pizza is a personal craving he wants to prioritize. However, the way he plans to handle the pizza by taking her leftovers could be perceived as manipulative or not honoring the agreed-upon split. That might make the author the asshole here because he's not following through on the agreement he was given to order the pizza. Even if he thinks his split is fair, he's going against what the wife expects, which could undermine trust or mutual respect.\n"
