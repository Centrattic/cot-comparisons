My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the pizza situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author wants to order a pizza and expects to get more than half (60%) because he's bigger and eats more. His wife, on the other hand, insists on a 50-50 split. The author feels that the 50-50 split isn't fair given their body sizes. He also mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, where he eats cheaper items, but he's encouraging her to order expensive ones she likes.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and equality in a relationship. The author argues that physical size and appetite should determine the split, while the wife believes in equal sharing as partners. The author's plan is to take her share after she's done eating, which he doesn't feel bad about, even if she has to eat natto the next day.\n\nNow, in relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife's stance is on equality, which is a common value in relationships. The author, however, is advocating for a share based on individual needs. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not adhering to the 50-50 split despite the wife's consistent requests.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on his physicality, but the wife's expectation is about equality. The fact that the author is willing to take her leftovers without guilt might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if he's eating more, respecting her wishes might be more important than the literal division of food. Also, the author's actions could be seen as undermining her autonomy in decision-making. \n\nBut then, the author is also giving her other treats, like sushi, which he himself doesn't enjoy as much. That might balance things out, but the core issue is the pizza split. The wife might feel that the 50-50 is about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. The author's plan to take her share after she's done could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate, making him the asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple had discussed and agreed on a different split, maybe it's okay, but the wife has consistently demanded half. The author's refusal and his plan to take her leftovers could be seen as disrespectful. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
