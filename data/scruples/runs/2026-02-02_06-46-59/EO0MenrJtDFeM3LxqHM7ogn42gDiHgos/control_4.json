My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband and wife arguing over how to split a pizza. The husband ordered a pizza using a coupon, and the wife wants half, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. The wife insists on equal halves because they're supposed to be equals. The husband plans to let her eat her half but then take the remaining if she doesn't finish it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about fairness and mutual agreement. The wife gave permission for him to buy the pizza, so he's following through. But the split is the issue. He argues based on his size and appetite, while she's going by equality. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when people split something, especially in a relationship, it's often about compromise. Even if they are equal in rights, individual needs might differ. However, the wife's stance is that they should split it equally because of equality. The husband is using physical size as a justification for a larger share. \n\nBut does that make him in the wrong? Well, it's a matter of perspective. If they had agreed on splitting it 50-50, then he's breaking that agreement by taking more. But he hasn't agreed to that split, so he's not necessarily wrong. However, planning to take more than agreed without discussing it could be seen as manipulative. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions he takes her to sushi places. Maybe there's an imbalance in how they spend together. But the question is specifically about the pizza split. \n\nThe wife's argument is about equality, which is a common value. The husband's argument is about practical needs. The husband's plan to take more after she eats her half might be seen as unfair because he's not respecting her initial request. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends. If they had an agreement to split 50-50, then yes. But since he never agreed, and he's just stating his preference, maybe not. However, his plan to take more without her consent could be seen as wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not agreeing to 50-50 but also for planning to take more unilaterally. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. If the husband is willing to let her eat until satisfied and then take what's left, maybe it's a middle ground. But by planning to take more, he's not respecting her share. \n\nI think the answer is A, he's in the wrong. Because even if he disagrees with 50-50, he should respect her wishes and not take more than he's supposed to. Planning to take more without agreement is unfair.\n"
