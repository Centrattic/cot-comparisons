My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author wants to have 60% of the pizza because he's taller and bigger, eats more, but his wife insists on a 50-50 split. The author is planning to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest himself, even if she ends up eating natto the next day instead of leftover pizza. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is okay with him buying the pizza because he found a coupon and it's a treat. The author does things like taking her to sushi four times a year, where he encourages her to get the more expensive options, while he gets cheaper ones. So there's some balance in their exchanges.\n\nThe main issue is the pizza split. The author argues that since he eats more and is bigger, a 60-40 split is fair. His wife, however, thinks equality means 50-50. The author's plan is to let her eat her half, then take the rest. But if she eats all her half, he's okay with that, but if she leaves some, he'll take it. But if she's left with leftovers, she'll have to eat natto the next day instead of pizza. \n\nNow, is 50-50 fair? In relationships, fairness can be subjective. The wife might value equality, while the husband values equity (giving based on need). However, the husband's actions here might be seen as taking advantage. Even if he's bigger, the wife's preference for equality could be a valid perspective. Also, the husband's plan to take the leftover half if she doesn't finish it could be seen as undermining her choice. \n\nAnother angle: the husband is using the coupon and the permission from his wife to get pizza, but then not respecting her terms for splitting. If she agreed to the pizza because of the coupon, maybe she expected the split to be 50-50. The husband's previous attempts to negotiate 60-40 and her insistence on 50-50 suggest that this is a recurring issue. \n\nThe husband's plan to take the leftover pizza might be considered selfish. Even if he's bigger, respecting her wishes in their agreements could be important for mutual respect in the relationship. The husband's argument is based on his own needs, but relationships often require compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be being unreasonable if the husband's dietary needs or preferences are legitimate. But the husband's solution of letting her eat first and then taking the rest could be seen as manipulative, especially if he knows she won't finish her half. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting his wife's terms for the split, even if he believes his reasoning is fair. Relationships require compromise, and if the wife has made her position clear, the husband's plan to circumvent her wishes might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
