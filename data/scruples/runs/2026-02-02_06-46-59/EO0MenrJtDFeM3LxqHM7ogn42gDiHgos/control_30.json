My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where they want to split the pizza 60-40 instead of 50-50. So the author ordered pizza for dinner, the wife agreed but wants half each. The author says they're bigger and eat more, so 60-40 is fair. The wife insists on equal halves. \n\nFirst, I need to think about fairness in relationships. The wife is asking for equal division because they're supposed to be equals. But the author feels their body size justifies a different split. However, the key point here is that the wife gave permission to order the pizza, so maybe she's okay with them sharing it. The author's argument is based on their eating habits and physical size. The wife might see the 50-50 split as a way to ensure she gets her fair share, especially if she's not as enthusiastic about pizza. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they take her to sushi places, but they order from the kid's menu. Maybe that's a pattern of not respecting her preferences in some way? But the user says they encourage her to order the expensive plates. So that's a plus. \n\nThe problem is whether expecting a different split is unreasonable. If the wife has already agreed to the pizza being ordered under the condition of splitting it, the author might be in a tough spot. Even if they think 60-40 is fair, the wife's agreement was based on the 50-50 split. The author's plan to take the remaining after she's done might be seen as underhanded. It's about respecting the agreed terms, even if the person thinks they could get away with more. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If the wife's main point is equality, then the author might be in the wrong by not honoring that. Unless there was a misunderstanding, but the author should have considered that when asking for permission. Maybe they should have discussed the split beforehand instead of assuming. \n\nSo the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the agreed split and are being sneaky about taking more.\n"
