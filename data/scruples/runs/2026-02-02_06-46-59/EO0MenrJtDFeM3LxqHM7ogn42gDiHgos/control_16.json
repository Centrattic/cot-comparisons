My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person wants to order a pizza but their wife insists on splitting it 50-50, even though the author thinks they should have 60% because they're bigger and eat more. The wife is okay with them getting pizza because of the coupon, but the division is an issue.\n\nHmm, first, the author acknowledges that the wife doesn't like pizza being ordered because it's unhealthy and expensive. So they got permission with a coupon. That part seems fair. But then the split. The wife wants half each, which the author disagrees with. The author argues that because they're taller and bigger, they should have more. The wife wants equality.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, maybe fairness isn't just about body size. The wife might feel that since they're both adults, they should have equal shares, regardless of their size. But the author is trying to justify it based on their physical needs. However, the wife's reasoning is about equality in the relationship. \n\nBut also, the author mentions that they order pizza 4 times a year and take her to sushi places. They even let her order expensive sushi while they get cheaper options. So maybe the author is already giving her more in other ways. The pizza might be a small thing, but the wife is pushing for equal shares. \n\nThe author's plan is to let her eat her half, then take some of it if she leaves leftovers. That might be seen as sneaky or not respecting her wishes. The wife might feel disrespected if the author doesn't follow through on the agreed 50-50 split. Even if the author thinks it's fair, if the wife is okay with the coupon deal but not the split, the author might be overstepping. \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect and compromise. The wife might feel that equality is important, and the author is insisting on their own terms without considering her perspective. Even if the author's reasons are logical, the wife's feelings about equality could make the author the asshole here. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the agreed-upon split and their wife's preference for equality, despite their reasoning.\n"
