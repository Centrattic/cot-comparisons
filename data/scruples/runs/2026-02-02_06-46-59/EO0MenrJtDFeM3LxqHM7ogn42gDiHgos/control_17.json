My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author wants to order a pizza, which their wife is okay with because they found a coupon. The wife says they should split it 50-50, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more. The author also mentions that they take the wife to a nice sushi place four times a year, where they order cheaper food, but let her have the expensive stuff. Now, the author plans to let the wife eat until she's full, which they think will be less than half, then take the rest. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting the pizza. The wife's argument is that they should split it equally as equals. The author argues that their body size and appetite justify a 60-40 split. That makes sense because people have different appetites. But the wife's insistence on half might be based on principles of fairness, even if practical appetite varies. \n\nThen there's the part about the sushi. The author takes the wife to a nice place but orders from the kid's menu, which is cheaper. They encourage her to get the expensive plates. That seems generous, but maybe the wife feels the pizza situation isn't being handled with the same generosity. The author's plan to take the remaining pizza after the wife eats her \"half\" might make the wife feel disrespected. Even if she eats less, the author is taking more without asking, which could be seen as a power play. \n\nAlso, the wife doesn't like pizza and allowed the author to get it as a special treat. Maybe she's compromising by letting the pizza happen at all, so expecting an equal split is her way of maintaining some balance. The author's response, though, might be seen as undermining that compromise by not respecting her request. \n\nIs the author being reasonable by considering their own appetite? Maybe, but they're also planning to take more without consent after the wife eats. That could be seen as manipulative. The key here is mutual respect. If the wife asked for 50-50, and the author goes against that, even if it's based on personal need, it's a breach of agreement. The author's justification might be logical, but the action is disrespectful. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
