My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple arguing over splitting a pizza. The author wants a 60-40 split because he's bigger and eats more, while his wife insists on 50-50 for equality. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband ordered pizza because he loves it, got a coupon, and his wife allowed it. He chose a large pizza not for value but because he likes eating a lot. The wife's request for half is based on equality, while the husband argues for a split based on physical size and eating habits.\n\nThe husband also mentions that he takes his wife to sushi four times a year, where she gets expensive plates while he gets cheaper ones. This seems like a balancing act where he's making up for her disliking pizza. But he's still not satisfied with the pizza split. \n\nSo, the question is whether the husband's plan to take advantage of her eating her half and then eating the rest is asshole behavior. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife's stance is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The husband argues that equality in portion size isn't fair because they have different needs. However, fairness can be subjective. In many relationships, equal sharing is seen as equitable unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise, and communication is key. The husband has brought this up before, but the wife still insists on half. \n\nThe husband's plan to eat more than his share by letting her eat her half and then taking from hers is a bit of a passive-aggressive tactic. It might be seen as underhanded because he's not directly negotiating but trying to take advantage of the situation. \n\nAlso, the husband's justification for taking more pizza because he's bigger and eats more could be problematic. It's similar to the sushi situation where he gets what he likes while she gets more expensive, high-end options. It might imply that he expects different treatment in different scenarios, which could be seen as inconsistent or unfair.\n\nThe wife's perspective is that since they're equals, they should split it equally. The husband's argument is about his physical needs, which could be valid, but the way he's planning to handle it might be the problem. By not negotiating and instead taking more underhandedly, he's not respecting her wishes. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences and agreements is important. Even if the husband believes that 60-40 is fair, the wife's agreement was for the whole pizza, and she expects half. If she's not willing to budge, the husband's best approach would be to either accept her terms or communicate better. Instead, he's planning to circumvent her by letting her eat her half, then taking the rest, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's main issue is not necessarily wanting a different split but the way he's handling it. The plan to take more under the guise of letting her eat her fill is where he goes wrong. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
