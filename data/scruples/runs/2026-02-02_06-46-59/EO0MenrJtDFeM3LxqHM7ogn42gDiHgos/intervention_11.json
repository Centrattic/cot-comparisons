My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered a pizza, got permission from his wife using a coupon, but now she wants half each. He argues that since he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he eats cheaper, so he thinks she should be okay with less pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reasoning is valid. The wife gave permission for the pizza, so he's following through. But the disagreement is about the split. The author is suggesting an unequal division based on their body size and eating habits. However, the wife wants equal halves. The concept of equality in relationships is often emphasized, but that doesn't necessarily mean equality in every aspect. \n\nIn relationships, fairness can be subjective. The author feels that his size and appetite justify a larger share. But the wife might see it as a matter of partnership and fairness, expecting equal sharing. The author's plan to take more from her half after she's full seems sneaky, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if he's not in the wrong in his own mind, his approach might undermine trust or respect. \n\nAlso, the fact that he orders sushi for her more often and eats cheaper options might be his way of balancing, but the wife might not view it that way. She could see the pizza as a special treat and want to share it equally. The key here is mutual respect and communication. If the author had discussed the 60-40 split earlier and both agreed, it might be okay, but since she's insisting on half, he's not respecting her boundary. \n\nSo the author is being inconsiderate of his wife's preferences, even if he thinks his logic is sound. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her wishes and is planning to take more than agreed, which could be seen as unfair or dishonest.\n"
