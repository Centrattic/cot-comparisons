My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about splitting a pizza between a husband and wife.\n\nSo the husband wants 60% of the pizza because he's taller, bigger, and eats more. The wife insists on 50-50 because they're supposed to be equals. The husband orders pizza 4 times a year and takes her to sushi places too, but he's not happy with the equal split.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and equality in a relationship. The wife is advocating for equal shares, which she sees as fair. The husband argues based on physical size and appetite. But relationships often prioritize mutual respect and compromise over strict fairness based on individual needs.\n\nThe husband's plan to take more after the wife eats her half could be seen as deceptive. Letting her eat her fill first and then taking the rest of her portion might make her feel disrespected. Even if she eats less, he's taking more without agreement, which could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the wife allowed him to order the pizza with a coupon, so maybe she expected a fair split. The husband's approach undermines her expectation. Relationships require consideration of each other's feelings, not just logical arguments. The husband's insistence on 60-40 might be seen as not valuing equal partnership, even if he's bigger. The wife's stance on equality is a common value in relationships, so the husband's plan to take more without consent might be the issue here.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon equal split and his plan is manipulative. Even if he's bigger, the wife's feelings and the mutual agreement are important. The husband should communicate better instead of taking more without consent.\n"
