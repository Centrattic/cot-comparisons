My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. They provided the context and their own opinion, thinking the author is at fault, and want to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband wants to order a large pizza, not just for value but because he likes to eat a lot of it. His wife has agreed because he found a coupon, but she insists on having half. He argues that since he's bigger and eats more, 60-40 is fair. He mentions he takes her to sushi places four times a year, but he prefers cheap plates while she likes the expensive ones. Now, he's planning to let her eat her fill (which he expects will be less than half) and then take the rest of her half, leaving her with natto for breakfast instead of leftovers.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is about fairness and compromise in their relationship. The wife agreed to the pizza order because he found a coupon, so she might be more lenient about the cost. However, she's setting a boundary on the portion size. The husband is dismissing her preference by saying he'll take more after she's done. That seems like he's not respecting her initial condition. Even if he thinks her half is excessive, she might have her own reasons\u2014maybe she actually wants to eat half, or she's trying to balance their meals, especially since she's concerned about health and cost.\n\nThe husband's plan involves tricking her into giving up her half by letting her eat first, then taking the remaining. This is manipulative. He's not being honest about his intentions. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If she's set on half, he should either agree or not order pizza. Instead, he's circumventing her request, which is disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the fact that he takes her to sushi places but encourages her to eat expensive plates while he sticks to cheap ones might imply he's used to her preferences being accommodated. But in this case, he's not doing the same. He's using the coupon as a reason to get her permission, then breaking the agreement. That's a problem. \n\nSo, even if the couple has different sizes and appetites, the husband isn't honoring the agreed-upon split. His approach is sneaky and undermines her autonomy. The wife's insistence on half could be about equality, health, or cost, and he's not respecting that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
