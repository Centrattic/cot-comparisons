My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered a large pizza using a coupon their wife allowed them to use. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more. The author also mentions they take the wife to a nice sushi place four times a year, but they order cheap plates while she can have the expensive ones. Now, the author plans to let the wife eat her fill, which they expect to be less than half, and then eat the rest of her half. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The wife gave permission for the pizza because of the coupon, but she expects equal sharing. The author feels that their body size and appetite justify a larger share. The author also points out their own gesture of taking the wife to sushi, where they let her have the expensive items while they stick to cheaper options.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The wife agreed to the purchase under the condition of splitting it equally. The author is now trying to get a larger share, which the wife doesn't agree with. Even though the author has a different idea of fairness based on their size and eating habits, the wife's expectation is 50-50. The author's plan to take advantage of the wife's portion after she's done eating seems manipulative. The author is being selfish here, not respecting the agreed-upon terms. Even if the author feels it's fair, the wife's consent was based on equal division. The author's actions would lead to the wife having less food, maybe even missing out on breakfast, which is a bit harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to justify their stance by mentioning their own sacrifices, like the sushi outings. However, those are separate instances and don't necessarily balance out the current situation. The wife might see the pizza as a special treat that she agreed to under specific terms. The author's refusal to honor that agreement could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's plan to take the leftover of her portion after she's had enough might be seen as exploiting the situation, which could be viewed as the asshole move. \n\nIn relationships, compromise and respecting agreements are important. The author is not respecting the wife's stated terms, even though they have their own reasoning. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're not honoring the agreement they were given to order the pizza in the first place. The wife's insistence on equality, while perhaps not considering the author's needs, is part of the mutual agreement. The author's plan to circumvent that agreement by their own method is the issue here.\n"
