My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is planning to order a pizza, and their wife doesn't like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive. But he got a coupon and she allowed him to buy it. Now, the wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks 60/40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions he takes her to sushi 4 times a year, where he eats cheaper, and she eats expensive. He plans to let her eat until she's full (which he thinks will be less than half), then he'll eat the rest of her half. He also says she'll have to eat natto instead of leftover pizza the next day and he's not feeling bad about it. The question is, is the author the asshole?\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The wife gave permission for the pizza, but set a condition of splitting it 50-50. The author disagrees and wants 60-40. The wife's reasoning is about equality, the author's is based on body size and appetite. The author is okay with her having less than half, then he'll take her leftovers. But is that fair?\n\nFirst, the wife agreed to the pizza purchase on the condition of splitting it equally. The author is going back on that agreement. Even if he thinks the ratio is unfair, he could have negotiated. But instead, he plans to let her eat her half, but take the leftovers. That seems like he's circumventing her rule. She might feel disrespected if he doesn't follow through on the initial agreement. Also, he's being a bit controlling by deciding she'll have to eat natto instead of pizza, which could be seen as dismissive of her preferences.\n\nThe author's justification is about equality vs. physical needs. But in a relationship, compromise is important. The wife might feel that the 50-50 is a fair compromise given that pizza is a treat, and expecting different portions based on appetite could lead to resentment. The author is also comparing it to sushi, where he's letting her eat more expensive things, but that's different because the sushi is her preference, and he's making a choice to eat cheaper. However, in the pizza case, he's making a choice to take more, which might not be as balanced.\n\nSo overall, the author is not respecting the agreed-upon terms (50-50) and is planning to take more by letting her eat her half and then taking the rest. That seems manipulative. The wife's argument is about equality, and the author is undermining that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
