My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about pizza sharing between the author and their wife. The author ordered pizza because they have a coupon and their wife allowed it. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're bigger and eat more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The author mentions they take their wife out for sushi four times a year, but they order cheap plates while encouraging her to get the expensive ones. So, maybe there's a pattern of unequal sharing here. But the wife is asking for equal halves. The author is planning to take the remaining pizza after the wife eats her half if she doesn't finish it, which could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's perspective is about equality, which is a common value in relationships. The author's argument is based on physical size and appetite, but that might not be a strong enough justification for others. Also, the author's plan to take extra if the wife doesn't finish her half could be seen as not respecting her decision. \n\nSo, considering mutual respect and the idea that agreements between partners should be honored, the author's plan to overeat might be at fault. Even if they think 60-40 is fair, the wife has stated her expectation, and the author is not respecting that. The part where they mention not feeling bad about it might indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting the agreed-upon split and are planning to take more than half regardless.\n"
