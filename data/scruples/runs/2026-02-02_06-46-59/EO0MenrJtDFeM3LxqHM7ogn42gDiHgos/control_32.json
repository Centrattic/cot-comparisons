My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about pizza sharing between the author and his wife. The author ordered a pizza using a coupon his wife allowed him to use. The wife wants half, but he thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi places where he eats cheaper, so he feels like he's balancing things.\n\nFirst, consent is a big part here. The wife gave permission to buy the pizza, so maybe she expects some agreement on how to split it. The author thinks 60-40 is fair based on their body size and eating habits. However, the wife insists on equality, 50-50. They've had this discussion before, so there's a history of disagreement.\n\nThe author's plan is to let the wife eat her fill (which he believes will be less than half) and then take the remaining. But he's okay with her having to eat natto instead of leftovers. The question is whether this is fair or if he's being inconsiderate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the coupon permission but not the agreed-upon split. He's justifying it by his physical needs. On the other hand, the wife might see it as unfair because she's being forced into a less fair split. Even if she eats less, the initial agreement was 50-50, so breaking that could be seen as not respecting her wishes. Also, the author is planning to take advantage of her eating less, which might come off as manipulative. \n\nConsidering mutual respect in a relationship, if the wife clearly states her expectation and the author disregards it, that might be the issue. Even if he's trying to be fair based on his view, not honoring her preference could be seen as inconsiderate. Plus, the fact that he's not feeling bad about her having to eat natto the next day suggests he's not considering her feelings or the potential conflict. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's expressed wishes despite their prior discussions. Even if he thinks his reasoning is logical, the key is whether he's respecting the compromise they've agreed upon. The answer might be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
