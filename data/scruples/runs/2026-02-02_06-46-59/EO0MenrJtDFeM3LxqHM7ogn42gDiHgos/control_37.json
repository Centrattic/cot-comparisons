My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants 60% for themselves and 40% for the wife, while the wife wants half each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife allowed the purchase because of a coupon and agreed to the dinner. The author argues that since they're bigger and eat more, 60-40 is fair. The wife insists on equality because they're supposed to be equals.\n\nThe author also mentions that they take her to sushi 4 times a year, but they order cheap plates while encouraging her to get expensive ones. So maybe there's a pattern of the author giving her more in other areas, but expecting an unequal split here.\n\nBut the key point is the fairness of the split. The wife's reasoning is based on equality, which is a common value in relationships. The author's reasoning is based on physical needs. However, splitting a pizza is often about sharing, not just physical needs. The author's plan to take leftovers from her half after she's full might be seen as underhanded, even if they don't take it directly. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting more than half. The wife's agreement to the purchase might not imply agreement to the split. The author's argument about their size and appetite isn't necessarily a valid reason to others. Relationships often require compromise, so the author's refusal to split equally could be seen as not considering the wife's feelings, even if she's okay with the purchase. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as taking advantage of the wife's agreement to buy pizza and then asserting a different split. The wife's insistence on equality could be about fairness in the relationship, not just the pizza. The author's plan to take the leftovers after she's done could be manipulative, which might make them in the wrong. \n\nBut does wanting a 60-40 split make the author wrong? Maybe not inherently, but the way they handle it and their reasoning could be problematic. The fact that they mention not feeling bad about taking her leftovers might indicate a lack of empathy. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the equal partnership the wife values, even if their logic is based on physical needs.\n"
