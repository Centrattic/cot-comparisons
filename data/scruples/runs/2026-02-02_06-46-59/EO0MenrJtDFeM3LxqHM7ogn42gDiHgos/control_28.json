My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza with their wife.\n\nFirst, the author ordered a pizza using a coupon their wife allowed. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He mentions that he takes her to sushi places four times a year, but he doesn't really like the expensive sushi. He encourages her to order the better stuff there. Now, he's planning to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest of her half, leaving her with natto for breakfast. He's not feeling bad about it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual agreement. The wife wants equality (half each) as she sees them as equals. The author argues that their physical differences mean he should get more. But maybe the wife values emotional or symbolic equality over physical needs? Also, the author's reasoning for sushi\u2014encouraging her to get the better stuff even though he doesn't care for it\u2014suggests he's being considerate in other areas. But he's taking that into account when arguing for pizza. \n\nBut here's the thing: if the wife agreed to the coupon deal, she might have expected a certain arrangement. However, the author is now going against her expectation of splitting it equally. The author's plan is to take more after she eats her half. That seems a bit sneaky. Even if he's bigger, if the agreement was half each, maybe he's going beyond that by not just taking his half upfront. \n\nAlso, the author is using the sushi example to show he's considerate, but in that case, he's letting her have the better parts, which she likes. But with pizza, he's not being as considerate. Perhaps the wife feels that the pizza is a shared meal, so equality is important. The author's approach might be undermining mutual respect if he's not following through on the agreed split.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because he agreed to the coupon deal under the condition of splitting equally but is now trying to take more than agreed, even if he thinks it's fair. The wife's expectation of equality in the meal might be about fairness in the moment, not just based on physical size. The author's plan to take her leftovers after she's full could be seen as being petty or not respecting her wishes, even if he's justifying it by his needs.\n"
