My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about splitting a pizza with their wife. The author wants 60% and the wife wants 50-50. The author argues that since they're bigger and eat more, 60-40 is fair. The wife insists on equality. \n\nFirst, the key points here are about fairness and mutual agreement. The wife gave permission to order the pizza, but the split is an issue. The author mentions that they take her to sushi four times a year, but they order cheap for themselves and let her have the better stuff. Maybe that's part of the reasoning for the unequal pizza split.\n\nBut when it comes to sharing, the general idea is that if both are contributing to the expense, a 50-50 split is common. However, in this case, the author used a coupon and the wife allowed them to buy it. So they might be the sole buyer here. The author's argument is based on their own consumption needs versus the wife's. \n\nThe wife wants equality in division, maybe because she feels it's a joint meal or they are equals in the relationship. The author's plan to take more after she's full seems manipulative. They're taking advantage of her initial amount to eat and then taking the rest. That might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author doesn't feel bad about it. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are mutual respect and agreed-upon terms. If the wife is uncomfortable with the 60-40 split, the author is not respecting her boundaries. The author's strategy to take more after she's done might come off as sneaky and disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that their body needs justify more food. But in a relationship, compromise is often necessary. The wife's insistence on equality might stem from fairness in their shared life, not just the pizza. The author's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as prioritizing their own needs over mutual agreement. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they're not respecting their wife's wishes and are planning to undermine her declared half. Even if the reasoning is logical, the action might not be considerate enough. So the answer is A.\n"
