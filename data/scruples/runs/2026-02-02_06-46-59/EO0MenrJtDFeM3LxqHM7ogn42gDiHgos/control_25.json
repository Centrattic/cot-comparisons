My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person wants to order a pizza, which their wife doesn't love because of health and cost. They found a coupon and she allowed them to buy it. Now, the wife wants half the pizza each, but the author thinks that's unfair because they're bigger and eat more, so they want 60-40.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife agreed to the pizza because of the coupon, but she's setting a condition on how it's split. The author feels that 50-50 isn't fair based on their size and eating habits. The author also mentions that they take her to sushi four times a year, where they order cheaper for themselves and let her have the more expensive stuff. So they see this as a balance.\n\nBut the wife's side is that they should be equal. She might be trying to be fair in her own way. The author's plan is to let her eat her half first, and then take the rest if they're still hungry. That sounds manipulative, though. By letting her eat until she's full (which might be less than half), they can get more. But the wife might feel like she's being taken advantage of, even if the author isn't directly forcing her.\n\nIs it fair to split based on body size? Some people might argue that splitting food equally is about fairness, not about how much each person eats. Others might say it's reasonable if one person eats more. But the wife's argument is about equality. The author is trying to justify an unequal split by their own logic. However, the wife agreed to the purchase under the condition of equal split, so the author might be going against that agreement. Also, the author's plan to take advantage of her portion after she's full could be seen as sneaky and disrespectful.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is often important. The author could have tried to explain their reasoning and see if there's a middle ground, like a different split they both agree on. Instead, the author is planning to go ahead and take more, even if it means the wife has to eat natto the next day. That could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author doesn't feel bad.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be seen as not respecting the wife's terms, even if they have a reason. The wife's insistence on equal split might be her way of balancing things out, especially since the author allows her to have more expensive sushi. The author's plan to take more after the initial agreement is made could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
