My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting a pizza between the author and his wife. The author ordered a large pizza using a coupon his wife allowed. He wants a 60/40 split because he's bigger and eats more, but the wife insists on 50/50. The author plans to let the wife eat her half first, and then take the remaining part himself if she's not full. The wife, on the other hand, wants equal shares despite the husband's reasoning.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about fairness and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife gave permission to order the pizza, maybe with the expectation that it would be shared equally. The husband's argument is based on his physical size and eating habits, which he uses to justify taking more. But equality in relationships often isn't just about physical needs; it's also about respecting each other's preferences and the social norm of sharing equally when something is a shared expense or meal.\n\nThe husband mentions that he takes her to a nice sushi place four times a year, and he encourages her to order expensive items. However, in the pizza case, he's pushing for a different ratio. The wife might feel that the sushi outings are her way of enjoying her favorite food, while the pizza is his. But he's not forcing her to eat the pizza; he's just splitting it. The problem is that the wife's preference for equality is being disregarded because the husband thinks his needs are more. \n\nThe husband's plan to take more by letting the wife eat first and then take the remaining might be seen as manipulative or not respecting her right to her half. Even if she doesn't finish, he's taking the leftovers, which could be seen as not considering her wishes. The wife's insistence on half might be because she values equality, and the husband is undermining that by using his size as a reason. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The husband could argue that he's bigger, but the wife's perspective is about fairness and equality. The fact that the husband is planning to ignore her wishes and take more could be seen as disrespectful. So, the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting the agreed-upon share and is prioritizing his own needs over the wife's expectations of equality. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
