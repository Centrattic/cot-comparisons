My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author wants to order a large pizza because they like eating a lot of it. Their wife doesn't like pizza because it's unhealthy and expensive in Japan. She allowed them to get it with a coupon. But she wants half each, while the author thinks 60-40 is fair because they're taller and bigger, so they eat more. The author mentions they take her to sushi 4 times a year and encourage her to order expensive dishes, but she still insists on equal pizza portions. The author's plan is to let her eat her half until she's full, then eat the rest of her half. They don't feel bad about her having to eat natto for breakfast instead of leftover pizza.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and equality in a relationship. The wife is setting a boundary when she allows the pizza order, saying half is hers. The author is arguing that their body size and appetite justify a different split. But when the wife gave permission, she specified half each. The author might be overstepping by not honoring that agreement.\n\nEven though the author is bigger and eats more, the wife might have her own reasons for wanting half. Maybe she's okay with eating less of the pizza but still wants to partake, or she values the balance in their shared meals. The author is also bringing up the sushi outings as a point of comparison, but that might not be relevant here. If they agreed to her having half the pizza as part of the compromise for her allowing him to order it, then he's not honoring that. His plan to eat the leftovers from her half could be seen as manipulation, making her eat natto instead. It seems like the wife's request for equality is about mutual respect and compromise, not just the physical amount. So the author might be the asshole for not respecting her agreement and for the sneaky plan to take her share after she's done. The answer is likely A, yes.\n"
