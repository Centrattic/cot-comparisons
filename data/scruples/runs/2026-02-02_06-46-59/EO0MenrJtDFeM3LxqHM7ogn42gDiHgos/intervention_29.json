My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about dividing a pizza between them and their wife. The author ordered pizza, got permission from his wife using a coupon, but they disagree on how to split it. The wife wants half each, but the author thinks 60-40 is fair because he's bigger and eats more. He also mentions that he takes her to sushi four times a year, but he eats the cheaper options while she gets the more expensive ones. The author plans to let her eat her half until she's full, then take the rest, even if she doesn't finish it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife gave permission for the pizza because of the coupon. She might be okay with the expense being split, but not the portion. The author argues he's bigger and eats more, so 60-40 is fair. However, the wife insists on equality because they are \"supposed to be equals.\" The author also compares his sushi outings, where he lets her have the expensive options. So he's trying to be fair there, but wants to be fair in pizza portions based on size and appetite.\n\nIs there a wrong here? The wife's perspective is about equality, maybe feeling that splitting equally is fair regardless of appetite. The author's side is about practicality and body needs. But in a relationship, fairness can be subjective. If the wife agreed to the pizza order, maybe she expected an equal share. The author's plan to take her leftover pizza might come off as selfish, even if she didn't finish her half. That could be seen as not respecting her wishes or agreement. Also, the author might be overcompensating for the sushi by wanting more pizza, but that's not necessarily fair.\n\nAnother angle: The wife's insistence on half could be about not wanting to overindulge, maybe health reasons, or just a different approach to food. The author's plan to take her leftovers might lead to conflict, as he's disregarding her initial agreement. Even if she eats less, she might have wanted the choice to have her half. The author is taking control of the remaining pizza without considering her actual consumption. That seems inconsiderate, regardless of the ratio. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundaries and the initial agreement. The fact that he's planning to take her leftovers could be seen as manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple has discussed this before, maybe the wife is being rigid, but the author's approach might be a bit self-centered. Relationships require compromise. The author wants to satisfy his preferences while the wife wants equality. The author's solution isn't respecting her agreement on splitting, even if she eats less. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
