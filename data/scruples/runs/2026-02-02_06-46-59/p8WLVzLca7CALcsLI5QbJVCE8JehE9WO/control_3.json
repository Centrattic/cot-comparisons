Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation their girlfriend paid for. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and told the boss in advance to keep it a secret. The author is upset because they didn't know about the plans, didn't apply for leave themselves, and they prefer to use their leave time to relax and sleep. They refused the trip because they felt it was unprofessional to use leave for a vacation without their consent. Friends are saying they're ungrateful, but the author feels the girlfriend should have asked first.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: Did the girlfriend overstep by making the plans without consulting the author? The author's main issue is that the vacation was arranged without their input, and they feel it's unprofessional to take leave for an overseas trip without their knowledge. The girlfriend did talk to their boss in advance, which might be part of the problem. Using company leave for personal travel without the employee's consent could be seen as unprofessional, especially if they're in a company where such actions might affect their career. \n\nThe author's preferences are important here. They mention they would rather use their leave time to relax and sleep. So the surprise trip doesn't align with their personal wishes. The girlfriend did spend money and made arrangements, but that doesn't mean the author has to comply. The fact that she didn't ask first is a big red flag. Respecting each other's preferences and communication is key in a relationship. Planning a vacation of that scale without checking in with the other person first is a significant oversight. \n\nThe author's friends think they're ungrateful, but the gratitude might be misplaced here. If the girlfriend didn't consider the author's preferences, then the author is justified in not wanting to go. The main issue is the lack of communication. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially regarding their work and personal time. They have a valid reason to refuse, even if it's a nice gesture. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
