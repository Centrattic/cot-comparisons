Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but the partner refused to go because he didn't want to use his leave that way and felt it was unprofessional since she didn't ask him first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend arranged the trip without consulting the author. She talked to their mutual boss in advance to get leave approved. The author feels that using couples' leave is unprofessional and that she should have asked him first. His friends think he's ungrateful, but he believes he's right because of the lack of communication and his personal preferences.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The girlfriend's intention was a surprise, which is a common gesture to show love. She went through the trouble of planning and paying for everything, which is a big gesture. However, the author's main issue is that she didn't consult him. He has valid concerns about professionalism, especially since they report to the same boss, and using leave for an overseas trip might be seen as inappropriate if not discussed with him. Also, the author prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep, which is a personal preference he didn't get a chance to express.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more appreciative of the effort she made, even if he wanted to decline. Declining might have hurt her feelings, but the root issue is about communication. Did he have the right to refuse because she didn't ask? Relationships require mutual respect and communication. By not discussing the trip with him, she made a significant decision that affects him. However, he also could have communicated his travel preferences earlier instead of waiting until the surprise moment.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's a common reaction. The key here is whether the girlfriend overstepped by not consulting him, which she did. The author's decision to refuse was based on valid reasons, so he might not be in the wrong. However, the way he reacted could have been more considerate. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best response. Since the girlfriend didn't ask, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not going. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
