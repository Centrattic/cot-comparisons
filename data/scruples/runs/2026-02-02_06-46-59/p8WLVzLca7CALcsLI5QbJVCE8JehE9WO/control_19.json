Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to go on a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland as a birthday surprise. She used their mutual boss to arrange the time off without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't agree to the trip, feels it's unprofessional to use work leave for a vacation like this, and didn't want to go overseas anyway. His friends think he's being ungrateful, but he argues that she should have asked him first.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The girlfriend made decisions about the author's leave without his input. 2) The author didn't want an overseas trip. 3) Friends are saying he's ungrateful, but he feels she crossed a boundary by not asking. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is consent and communication. The girlfriend planned the trip without discussing it with him, which is a problem because any vacation, especially one using time off work, should involve both people's agreement. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to go\u2014personal preference for relaxing at home and professional concerns about how using leave for travel might affect his career. \n\nBut the girlfriend went ahead and booked everything, which might have been a nice gesture, but she didn't respect his autonomy in the decision-making process. The author's refusal isn't about not appreciating the gesture but about the lack of mutual agreement. \n\nThe friends argue he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to accept something that you're uncomfortable with, especially if it's a major life decision. The girlfriend's approach was to surprise him, but surprises in relationships can sometimes backfire if they don't consider the other person's preferences and boundaries.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend made a mistake by not discussing the trip with him. The author is justified in his refusal because his preferences weren't considered. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
