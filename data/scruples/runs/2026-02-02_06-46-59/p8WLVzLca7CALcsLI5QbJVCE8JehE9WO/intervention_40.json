Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he refused because he thinks it's unprofessional to have the boss involved in taking leave for a trip, and he wasn't consulted beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip, talked to their mutual boss months in advance without the boyfriend's knowledge. The author is upset because he didn't agree to it. He prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep instead of traveling. He's worried about professionalism and the boss's involvement. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked him first.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but she made a significant decision without consulting him. Using company leave, especially with their boss involved, could be a big deal. The author's main issue is that he wasn't consulted, which is a valid concern. People have the right to decide how they want to use their personal time. The girlfriend's approach might have been overreaching, especially since she paid for everything and now he's caught in a situation where canceling might be expensive.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action was a surprise, which can be sweet, but the method involved a third party (their boss) without the boyfriend's consent. That could be seen as a breach of trust or overstepping boundaries. The boyfriend's refusal is based on his own preferences and concerns about professionalism. His friends' opinion that he's ungrateful might come from the perspective of not appreciating the gesture, but the core issue is the lack of consultation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for refusing. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants input. From another angle, the girlfriend's actions were perhaps presumptuous, and the author is justified in standing up for his own wishes. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author has valid reasons related to personal choice and professionalism.\n"
