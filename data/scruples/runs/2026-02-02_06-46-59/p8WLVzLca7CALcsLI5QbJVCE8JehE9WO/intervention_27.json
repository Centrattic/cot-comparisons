Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves a couple working at the same company but different branches. The girlfriend surprised the author with tickets to Switzerland, arranged with their mutual boss. The author is upset because she didn't consult him and arranged leave without his input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points of conflict. The girlfriend spent money and organized time off without his consent. The author's main issue is that she didn't ask him and that he prefers to use his leave time to relax at home. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he feels it's unprofessional to use company leave for a trip, especially as a couple. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that his preferences and professional boundaries were disregarded. He didn't want an overseas trip and would have preferred to use his leave differently. Also, the fact that she went around him to get time off from their shared boss could be a point of contention, possibly affecting their careers if other employees found out.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for him, which is a common gesture in relationships. She might have thought her surprise was a way to show appreciation without knowing his preferences. The author's immediate reaction could be seen as dismissive of her effort, even if her method was flawed.\n\nNow, considering cultural or social norms, surprises in relationships are common, but they should ideally respect each person's boundaries. The author's right to have his time off preferences respected is important. If he communicated that he prefers not to travel, then her action is problematic. However, if he never expressed that, maybe her assumption was reasonable. But in this case, the author clearly states he would have preferred to relax and sleep, so his preferences were likely not communicated, leading to the conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The girlfriend paid for everything, and the author is aware that returning the tickets would cost her. His refusal could be seen as causing her financial loss, which complicates the situation. Is he being selfish by not going because of his own dislike, knowing she's out money?\n\nProfessionally, having the boss aware of personal leave for a trip might not be ideal, but the girlfriend took the initiative to handle it. The author's concern about unprofessionalism is valid, but that's his own perspective. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not going despite the financial and emotional investment.\n\nThe key here is consent and communication. The author believes he should have been consulted. Since he didn't want to go, it's his right to refuse, but the way he reacted might be seen as ungrateful. However, if he had communicated his preferences earlier, maybe the situation would have been different. The girlfriend's action was a surprise, but without checking his availability or preferences, which is a valid point.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both parties have valid points. The author is justified in feeling that his preferences were overlooked, but the girlfriend's gesture was meant to be kind. The answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is inconsiderate given the effort she put in, or if respecting his own boundaries is more important.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's main issue is about respecting his personal preferences and the potential professional implications. Since he clearly states that he doesn't want to use his leave for travel, and she didn't consult him, he's not in the wrong for refusing. However, the way he declined might have been abrupt, but the core issue is about respecting his wishes. So the answer would lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
