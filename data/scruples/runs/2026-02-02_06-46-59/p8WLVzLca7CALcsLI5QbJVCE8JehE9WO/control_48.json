Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and his girlfriend work for the same company, different branches. She planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, got their boss's approval months in advance without consulting him. The author is upset because she didn't ask if he wanted to go, and he prefers relaxing at home. Friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she overstepped by using company leave for travel without his input.\n\nNow, the main points to consider. The girlfriend organized the trip without his consent, even arranging leave through their mutual boss. That's a big deal because taking leave for a trip, especially a two-week one, is a significant decision that affects work. The author is right to feel that his input was necessary. Using their boss to arrange leave without discussing it with him might have been unprofessional, as the author mentioned. Also, the fact that she paid for everything, including resorts, complicates things because returning them would cost her money, but he's not obligated to go just because she spent money.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for him, and his reaction might come off as dismissive of her efforts. But his right to make his own decisions about travel and work time is important. The key issue here is consent and communication. She made a major decision without involving him, which is a breach of mutual respect in a relationship. Plus, the professional implications are real\u2014using company leave can affect job security or performance if not handled properly.\n\nThe author's friends think he's being ungrateful, but gratitude shouldn't override personal preferences. He's within his rights to decline. The fact that he tried to explain his reasons (preference to relax at home, not wanting to travel) shows he's being honest about his feelings. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
