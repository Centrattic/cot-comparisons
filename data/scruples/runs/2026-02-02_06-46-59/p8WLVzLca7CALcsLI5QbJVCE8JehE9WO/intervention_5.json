Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the author's birthday, paid for everything, and even got their boss to approve the time off. But the author is unhappy because the girlfriend didn't ask him first and he didn't want to take an overseas trip. He ended up refusing, and now she's upset, while his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. The girlfriend clearly put a lot of effort into planning this surprise. She went to the trouble of coordinating with their boss, which might be risky given they work in the same company. The author is in IT, and the girlfriend in HR at the same company. They have different schedules, so maybe they don't get much time together. The surprise was intended as a nice gesture for his birthday.\n\nThe author's main issues are two-fold: he didn't like the unprofessional approach of asking their boss about couples' leave, and he didn't want to go on an overseas trip. He felt she should have asked him first. But the girlfriend had already paid for everything, including ski resorts, so returning the tickets would cost her money. The author's friends think he's ungrateful.\n\nNow, was the girlfriend wrong to plan without consulting him? The author believes she should have asked. But in relationships, surprises are common. However, this is a significant financial and time commitment. Using company leave might be a sensitive issue, especially if the boss isn't supposed to know. The girlfriend might have thought she was doing something romantic, but the author feels it's unprofessional and that his autonomy was disregarded.\n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as a conflict between personal preference and the girlfriend's gesture. But he made it clear he doesn't want to go overseas, so maybe his stance is valid. On the other hand, the girlfriend's intentions were good, but her approach was flawed. She assumed he would be happy and didn't consider his personal preferences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not showing more gratitude? The friends think he's ungrateful, but he did explain his reasons. He's not rejecting the gesture itself but the method. The key here is whether the girlfriend overstepped by making decisions without his input, especially regarding his work and personal time. If he's uncomfortable with the travel plans and didn't want to go, then it's his right to refuse. However, the way he handled it might have been abrupt, leading to her being upset.\n\nSo considering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. He has valid reasons for his refusal. The girlfriend could have consulted him first, and the author's preferences should be respected. But maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing it before the trip and finding a compromise. But since the trip is already booked, the author's refusal is his choice. I think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his personal preferences and the girlfriend didn't ask first.\n"
