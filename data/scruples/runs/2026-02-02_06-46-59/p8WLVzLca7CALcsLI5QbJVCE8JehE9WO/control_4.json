Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to go on a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a trip to Switzerland with return flights and ski resorts. She talked to their boss in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because she didn't ask him and taking leave for a couples' trip might seem unprofessional. Also, he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep instead of traveling overseas.\n\nThe key points here: the girlfriend made decisions without consulting him, which he finds disrespectful. He's worried about professional implications. His friends think he's ungrateful. The girlfriend is annoyed because he wasn't enthusiastic.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wanted to do something nice, but maybe overstepped by not getting his consent. The author has valid concerns about work and personal preferences. Was it wrong for her to arrange it without him? And is it wrong for him to refuse?\n\nIn terms of the question, the author's main issue is that she didn't ask first. He has the right to decide how to use his leave. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. His friends saying he's ungrateful might not be right because he has legitimate reasons. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
