Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend surprised him with a vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go. The key points here are: the girlfriend arranged it without asking him, used his leave time (which she discussed with their boss), and the author is upset because he didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and prefers to relax and sleep instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend clearly put effort into planning a surprise, which she thought he would appreciate. She did consult the boss, so it's not like she did it without some planning. The author is upset because he wasn't asked, which is valid. He has his own preference for how he wants to spend his leave. But since the tickets are already paid for, returning them might incur fees, so he's in a bind.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, sometimes surprises can backfire if they don't consider the other person's preferences. The girlfriend might have assumed he would love the trip, but she didn't check in with him first. On the other hand, the author didn't express his preferences beforehand, so maybe he should have been more clear. However, the girlfriend did book the trip without his input, which could be seen as overstepping. The author's main issue is that his autonomy in deciding how to use his leave was not respected. In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate about such big decisions. So maybe the girlfriend did make a mistake by not asking. But the author is also not wrong for being upset and choosing not to go, especially if he really doesn't want to. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has a right to his own preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed it first. So the answer might be B.\n"
