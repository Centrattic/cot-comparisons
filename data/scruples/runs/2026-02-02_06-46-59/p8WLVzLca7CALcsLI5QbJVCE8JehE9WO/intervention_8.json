Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She had already arranged it with their boss, who they both report to. The key points here are: she made the arrangements without consulting him, she used her own money (since he didn't apply for leave), and he's upset because he wasn't asked and he prefers relaxing/sleeping over traveling. The friends think he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's upset because she didn't check with him before making such a big decision. Using company leave for a trip without consulting him feels unprofessional to him, and he's concerned about career implications. Also, he doesn't want to travel, so he's not excited. He's trying to be honest but is getting criticized by friends and his girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships. While surprises can be nice, a vacation is a significant commitment, especially when it involves work leave. Even if she used her own money, the leave from work is tied to his schedule. She should have discussed it with him to respect his preferences and avoid potential issues at work. The fact that she went to their boss without consulting him first adds another layer of concern about professional conduct.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might have intended this as a thoughtful surprise, showing her effort and affection. But the way she did it\u2014without communication\u2014could have been a misstep. The author's main issue is the lack of consultation, not the trip itself. He's not rejecting the gesture but the manner in which it was given. His friends' perspective is that he should be grateful, but gratitude doesn't erase the need for mutual discussion in a relationship.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? He's standing up for his own needs and boundaries. However, his refusal might come off as dismissive of her intentions. But the core of the issue is whether she should have asked. Since she didn't, both parties have valid points. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's highlighting that consent and communication are important in such decisions. Relationships require both partners to consider each other's preferences and boundaries. If she had asked, he might have said yes or discussed alternatives. By not doing so, she overstepped. Therefore, the author is justified in his stance.\n"
