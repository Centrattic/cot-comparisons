Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland for the author's birthday. She arranged it without consulting him, even talking to their mutual boss in advance. The author is upset because he didn't know about the trip beforehand, didn't agree to using his leave for it, and he prefers to relax at home instead. He refused to go, which upset her. Friends think he's ungrateful.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend took initiative, but did she overstep? The author feels that she should have asked him first. Using company leave for personal travel is a big decision, especially if they're in the same company. The author is concerned about professionalism and his career impact. Additionally, he didn't want to travel, so the trip wasn't his preference.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to surprise him with a special gift. She might have thought it was a nice gesture, not considering his personal preferences. But did she have the right to make such a decision without his input? The fact that she used their boss to keep it a secret adds another layer of unprofessionalism, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. That could indeed be problematic for the author's career.\n\nThe author's main issue is that his preferences weren't considered. He might feel that his autonomy in deciding how to use his leave was violated. The girlfriend's action, while well-meaning, might have been too controlling without respecting his boundaries.\n\nNow, the friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to agree to everything. If the trip wasn't his preference, he's not wrong for declining. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't consult him and the trip could have professional repercussions, the author's stance seems reasonable. He's standing by his personal choice and professional concerns. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
