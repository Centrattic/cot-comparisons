Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland and told the author that she spoke to their mutual boss months in advance to get the time off. The author is upset because he didn't consent to this, didn't apply for leave himself, and prefers to use his time off to relax at home. He refused to go, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main points here: the girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, involving work leave and significant expense. The author feels it's unprofessional and a misuse of his leave. His friends think he's ungrateful for not accepting the gift.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining. On one hand, the girlfriend did something thoughtful but without his input. On the other, the author has the right to decide how he uses his personal leave. The girlfriend might have overstepped by not asking if he wanted to take an overseas trip, especially considering work implications. The fact that they have the same boss adds a layer of potential professional risk if the leave isn't properly handled, which the author is concerned about.\n\nThe author's reasons are valid: he didn't agree to the trip, didn't apply for leave, and prefers to use his time off differently. The girlfriend, however, might feel hurt that he's not appreciative. But the core issue is about consent and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Since the trip was a surprise without his consent, and he's not interested in traveling, his refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend should have discussed plans involving his leave before making commitments. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
