Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing the surprise vacation. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for it, and even got their boss to approve the time off without telling the author. The author didn't like that she didn't ask him first, and he prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. He refused to go, and now she's upset. Friends think he's ungrateful. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the girlfriend overstep by making plans without consulting him? Should the author have communicated his preferences earlier? The girlfriend used her own money and arranged the trip, which she might have done out of love, but it's a big decision that affects both of them. The author's main issue is that he didn't get to choose, which is valid. However, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she put effort into a surprise she thought he'd appreciate. \n\nThe author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but maybe he's justified in feeling that his preferences matter. However, refusing without considering her feelings could be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't ask for his input, which is a problem. So, maybe both have some responsibility here. But the question is about the author specifically. Did he do something wrong by refusing? If he had a valid reason (preferring to relax) and communicated it, maybe not. But if he didn't express his preferences earlier, then he might be at fault for not being upfront. \n\nWait, the author mentions he would prefer to use the time to relax and sleep, which is a personal preference. The girlfriend didn't ask, but he didn't communicate his own plans either. Maybe he should have had that conversation months ago if he wanted to avoid taking the trip. But since the boss was involved, it's a professional risk. The author might be right to be cautious about using leave for an overseas trip, especially if it's not discussed with his employer. However, the girlfriend's approach was to handle it without his input, which is the main issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he refused without considering her feelings and the effort she put in, maybe a bit. But if the problem is that she didn't ask, then he's justified. The answer might depend on whether the refusal was abrupt or if he tried to explain his reasons. The story says he told her he would refuse because she should have asked him first. That's a valid point, but maybe he could have been more considerate in his response. \n\nIn the end, both parties have some blame, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't consult him, he's not necessarily wrong for objecting. However, his refusal could have been handled better. The friends' perspective is that he's ungrateful, which might not be entirely accurate. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
