Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, using both their annual leave, which she arranged with their boss months in advance without consulting him. The author is upset because he didn't want to take an overseas trip and thinks she should have asked first. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he feels she overstepped by not discussing it with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend did plan the trip without his input, which is a big deal. Annual leave is a personal choice, so using it for something he didn't agree to could be an issue. Also, coordinating leave with their boss without his knowledge might be unprofessional, as the author points out. The girlfriend might have thought she was doing something thoughtful, but not checking in with him first is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the trip was a surprise, and she did pay for everything, including possible cancellation fees. The author's refusal might hurt her feelings, especially if she put a lot into planning it. But the main question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the intention was good, not discussing such a major trip that affects both people's time off is a significant oversight. The author isn't wrong for wanting to use his leave as he prefers. So, he's not being ungrateful just for wanting to opt out. The girlfriend should have discussed it first, especially since it's about their personal time and career-related leave. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend didn't consult him about using his leave, which is his right to manage. The author has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preference.\n"
