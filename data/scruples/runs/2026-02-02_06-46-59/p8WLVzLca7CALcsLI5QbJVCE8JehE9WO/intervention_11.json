Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe context is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for her birthday, paid for it, and got their boss to approve leave months in advance without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't want to take a vacation to Switzerland and felt it was unprofessional for her to arrange it without his input. He's being criticized by friends for being ungrateful and not going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to give a surprise, which she did with financial commitment and coordination. The author feels that using company leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional, which might be valid depending on the company's policies. Also, he didn't want to go on the trip and was not consulted, so his autonomy in planning his leave is a point.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she made a surprise to celebrate his birthday, which is a thoughtful gesture. However, she did it without his knowledge, which might have been a mistake. The fact that she arranged leave without checking with him could be seen as overstepping, especially if the company has specific leave policies that require the employee's consent.\n\nOn the author's side, he's refusing to go because he doesn't want to use his vacation time for a trip he didn't plan. He's concerned about professionalism and personal preference. His friends are telling him to go, but he's prioritizing his own preferences here.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? The key points are: 1) Did the girlfriend have the right to plan the trip without asking? 2) Is the author justified in refusing? \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been well-intentioned, but she didn't consider his preferences. The author has the right to his own vacation plans. Even though she paid for it, the trip wasn't something he wanted. The surprise element is nice, but without his input, it's a problem. \n\nThe author is also concerned about the professional implications. If the boss approved without the employee's knowledge, that might be an issue in the workplace. However, if the boss is okay with it, maybe that's a different matter. But the author's right to choose how to use his vacation time is a personal choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to go and for expressing that. He's standing up for his preferences, which is valid. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
