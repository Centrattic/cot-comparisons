Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author's girlfriend planned a surprise trip using their vacation days, which she arranged with their boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask first and they want to use the time to relax at home.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend paid for everything, including flights and ski resorts. The author mentions that she talked to their boss in advance, which the author thinks is unprofessional. But since they work in different departments with the same boss, maybe the boss is okay with it? The author is concerned about using vacation time for an overseas trip, but the girlfriend might not know that preference.\n\nThe main issue here is lack of communication. The girlfriend didn't ask if the author wanted to go, which is a big decision. Even though she had good intentions, surprising someone with such a significant trip without their input can lead to resentment. The author's friends say he's ungrateful, but he's not against the idea of a trip\u2014he just prefers to use his leave differently. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt because she put effort into planning this, but the author's point is valid: he should have been consulted. It's about mutual respect. The author didn't show excitement, which added to her annoyance. However, the problem lies in her not seeking his opinion first. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing; he's standing up for his personal preferences. The girlfriend's mistake was assuming he would want to go. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he communicated his preference and had valid reasons for not wanting to go.\n"
