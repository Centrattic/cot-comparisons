Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, using their leave time. She didn't consult him, even though they both work at the same company with the same boss. The author is upset because she went to their boss without his knowledge, which he sees as unprofessional and risky for his career. Plus, he didn't want an overseas trip and prefers to relax and sleep instead.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she planned a surprise as a birthday gift. She thought she was doing something nice, maybe to show her affection. But she didn't check with him about his preferences or the logistics. Using company leave for a trip without his input is a big deal, especially since they work at the same company. It's possible she meant well but overlooked his autonomy and work-related concerns.\n\nThe author's main issues are: 1) She didn't ask him if he wanted to take the trip. 2) She approached their boss without his knowledge, which he perceives as a risk. 3) He has different preferences for his leave. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, using company leave for personal travel without proper communication could be problematic. The author's job security is a valid concern. Also, personal autonomy is important; he should have a say in how he uses his time off. \n\nHis friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to agree with the gesture. The fact that she didn't consider his preferences might be a bigger issue. He's not rejecting the gesture out of spite but because it conflicts with his values and needs.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt because she put effort into the surprise, but the author's concerns are legitimate. The key points here are consent and communication. She should have discussed the trip with him first, especially given the professional risks involved.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend made the decision unilaterally without considering his input or the potential work implications, then the author's refusal is justified. He's not obligated to accept a surprise that he wasn't consulted about, especially one that affects his job. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
