Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend, who works in HR, arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him, using his leave time that she had discussed with their boss in secret. The author is upset because he didn't know about it, he didn't apply for leave, and he prefers to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to plan a surprise, which she might see as a thoughtful and generous gesture. She went to the trouble of coordinating with their boss, which could be seen as a big effort to make the trip happen. On the other hand, the author is not happy because the arrangement was done without his input, and he has different preferences for his time off. Also, there's a professional aspect here since they work for the same company and the boss was involved.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The girlfriend made a decision about his leave without his consent. 2) Using their boss to keep it secret might be a problem. 3) The author's preference for a different kind of vacation. 4) The potential for professional repercussions if the leave wasn't properly requested. \n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but that's subjective. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the context. If the girlfriend used her HR position to manipulate the leave request without the author's knowledge, that could be unprofessional. The author is within his rights to refuse if he's not comfortable with the arrangement. However, the surprise element and the effort she put in might make some think he should have been more receptive.\n\nAlso, the boss being in on it without the author's direct request could affect his standing at work. It's possible that the boss could view the unapproved leave as a breach of protocol, even if it was a surprise. The author's right to control his own leave is important. The girlfriend should have discussed this with him before making any commitments. So, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing because he has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preferences. The girlfriend's actions were overstepping by not getting his input. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
