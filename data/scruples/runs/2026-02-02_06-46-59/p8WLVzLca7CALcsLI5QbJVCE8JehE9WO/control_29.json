Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the author's birthday. She paid for it and even coordinated with their mutual boss to get the time off. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and that he didn't know about the plans until receiving the envelope. He's worried about the professionalism of their boss being involved and not wanting to use his leave for an overseas trip, preferring to relax at home instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are: surprise trip planned without his input, using company leave without his consent, and the author's discomfort with the situation. The author's friends think he's being ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's about autonomy and communication. He might feel that having a significant decision made for him, especially regarding his personal time, is a breach of trust or respect. Also, the fact that she involved their boss without his knowledge could make him feel that his professional reputation is at risk. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something special for his birthday. She might have thought it was a thoughtful gesture, not realizing how he would feel about the lack of consultation. Her actions could stem from wanting to create a memorable experience, but she might not have considered his preferences or boundaries.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author declined the trip because he didn't want to go, even though she had already arranged it, is that ungrateful? Or is it reasonable for him to express his preferences, especially regarding his own leave and personal time?\n\nIn terms of rights and expectations, it's important to note that while the girlfriend's intentions were good, she did make a decision that affects him without his input. The author has the right to his own time and should be involved in decisions about how to use it. Additionally, using company resources (boss's approval) without his knowledge could be a problem, depending on company policies, but the author's main issue is about personal preference.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel hurt or disrespected by his refusal, but the author's stance is about autonomy. In relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. The author's decision to decline isn't about being ungrateful but about his personal boundaries and preferences.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he has valid reasons related to personal choice and professional concerns that the girlfriend should have considered before making the plans.\n"
