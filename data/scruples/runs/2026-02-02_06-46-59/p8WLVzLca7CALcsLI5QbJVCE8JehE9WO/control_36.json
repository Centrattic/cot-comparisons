Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author's girlfriend planned a surprise birthday trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and even spoke to their mutual boss in advance to arrange time off. The author didn't like that the girlfriend went behind his back to get time off from work, which he thinks is unprofessional and might risk his career. Also, he didn't want to take an overseas trip and would prefer to relax and sleep during his leave. He decided to refuse the trip, leading to conflict with his girlfriend and friends saying he's being ungrateful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the girlfriend's actions. She planned a surprise without consulting him. While her intention might have been to make his birthday special, she didn't consider his preferences or professional concerns. She used her position in HR to coordinate with their boss, which could indeed be unprofessional, especially since they work in the same company. The author has valid concerns about how this could affect his job. Also, using company resources or relationships for personal reasons without the employee's consent is generally frowned upon.\n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The author's main point is that he wasn't asked if he wanted to go. The girlfriend assumed he would be happy, but he has different preferences. It's important in relationships to check in with each other's preferences and boundaries. The fact that she had already paid for everything complicates things, but that shouldn't override his right to be consulted.\n\nThe author's friends think he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean he has to accept something that goes against his values or job stability. He's standing up for his boundaries, which is healthy. However, he could have approached the situation differently, maybe expressing gratitude while explaining his reasons. But the core issue is that the girlfriend didn't seek his input, which is a significant oversight.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. The girlfriend made decisions without his consent, potentially risking their professional situations and ignoring his personal preferences. The author's refusal is about asserting his own needs and boundaries, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
