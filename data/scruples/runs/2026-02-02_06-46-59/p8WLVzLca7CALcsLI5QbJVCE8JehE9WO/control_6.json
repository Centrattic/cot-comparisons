Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation funded by her, using leave that was arranged without the author's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset because his girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She talked to their boss in advance, which he finds unprofessional, and he prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep. He didn't express initial enthusiasm, which made her annoyed. Friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, from the author's perspective: He's not happy about the surprise because it's a big decision that affects his work and personal preferences. Using company leave for a trip without his input seems like a breach of trust or at least poor communication. Also, the fact that she involved their boss in keeping a secret might be a red flag for him. He's concerned about professionalism and his own preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to give a surprise birthday gift. She went to the effort of booking everything and might have thought it was a great way to celebrate. Friends are telling him he's ungrateful, implying he should be happy to receive such a gift. But the author's issue is that it wasn't discussed with him first. Gifts are fine, but using his leave without consent could be a problem.\n\nLegally and ethically, using someone's leave without their input might not be ideal. Even if the intention is good, the method of not consulting him is problematic. He has the right to decide how he uses his own time off. The girlfriend might have overstepped by making such a significant decision without his approval. Plus, arranging it with their boss could be seen as unprofessional, which the author is justified in feeling concerned about.\n\nThe author's friends calling him ungrateful might be missing the point. Gratitude is important, but mutual respect in decision-making is also key in a relationship. The girlfriend didn't consider his preferences, which is a valid issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to go. He's standing up for his own needs and boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
