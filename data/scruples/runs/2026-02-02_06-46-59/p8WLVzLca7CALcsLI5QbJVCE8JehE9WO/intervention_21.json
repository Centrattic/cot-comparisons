Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and got his leave approved without asking him first. The author is upset because he didn't want to go on an overseas trip and feels it was unprofessional to get his leave approved without his input. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked him first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but she went ahead without consulting him. The author has valid concerns about professional boundaries and his personal preferences. The key issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to take the trip, even though it involves his leave time and career. That seems like a major oversight. While surprising someone can be a good gesture, it's important to respect their autonomy, especially when it affects their work. The author's refusal isn't about the value of the gift but about the lack of communication and the potential risks to his career. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was planning a surprise for his birthday, which she saw as a romantic gesture. But without checking in with him first, she bypassed his agency. The author's friends might be focusing on the gift rather than the process. So, is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't have to go, and his reasons are valid. He's not being ungrateful for the trip itself but for the way it was arranged. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his boundaries and preferences. The girlfriend made a decision that affects him without discussion, which is the main issue here.\n"
