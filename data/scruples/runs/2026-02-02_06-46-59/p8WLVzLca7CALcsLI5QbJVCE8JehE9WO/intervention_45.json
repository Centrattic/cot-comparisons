Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend. The author is conflicted because his girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him, using their mutual boss who had to keep it secret. He's upset because he didn't know about the plans beforehand and he prefers to relax and sleep during his leave instead of traveling. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he believes his girlfriend should have asked him first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend organized the trip without consulting the author. She used their shared boss, which might be a professional risk since they work in the same company but different departments. The author is not happy about the trip because of personal preference and potential professional issues. He's concerned about how it might look if they both take leave for a vacation, which could affect their careers.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a decision that affects both of them without discussing it first. Even though she paid for everything, the author's ability to choose how he uses his leave is important. His primary concern is about using his leave time for something he's not interested in, which is valid. The surprise aspect might have been well-intentioned, but the lack of communication is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action shows that she wanted to do something special for his birthday. She may have thought it would be a nice surprise, but she didn't consider his preferences. The fact that she involved their boss without his knowledge adds another layer of unprofessionalism, which the author is right to be concerned about.\n\nHis friends are telling him to go because it's a gift, but the author's main issue is the lack of consent and the potential professional repercussions. He's not in the wrong for expressing his discomfort and refusing to go. The girlfriend should have discussed the plans and considered his feelings and career impact.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons to refuse the trip, especially since his girlfriend didn't consult him and the arrangement could affect their professional lives. His right to make decisions about his own leave time is important, and the lack of communication from his girlfriend is the main issue here.\n"
