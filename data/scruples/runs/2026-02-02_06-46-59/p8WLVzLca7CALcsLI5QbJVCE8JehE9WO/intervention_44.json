Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend surprised him with a two-week vacation to Switzerland, which she paid for and arranged with their mutual boss. The author didn't agree to it and now the girlfriend is upset. The author is conflicted because he feels it's unprofessional to take couples' leave and would prefer to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend probably thought she was doing something nice, using her HR role to coordinate with the boss and plan this surprise. She might have thought it was a romantic gesture and believed the author would appreciate it. She already paid for everything, so returning the tickets would cost her money. On the other hand, the author feels that she should have asked him first because it's his vacation time. He didn't want to take an overseas trip and preferred to relax at home, which is a valid personal preference. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't get a chance to express his preferences, and the girlfriend made a significant decision without his input. Even though the girlfriend had good intentions, the author's right to decide how to use his own vacation time is important. Using company resources (like coordinating with the boss) without his consent could also be an issue, especially since they work in the same company. \n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but the problem isn't about being ungrateful; it's about autonomy over personal time. The girlfriend should have discussed the plan with him before making the arrangements. The author's reasons for declining are valid\u2014personal preference and professional concerns. So, the girlfriend is in the wrong for not seeking his approval first. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
