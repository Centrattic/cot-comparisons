Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation without the man's consent, even using their mutual boss to coordinate time off. The key points here are about consent, professional boundaries, and personal preferences.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend took the initiative to book a trip and inform their boss without consulting the man. The man feels that this was unprofessional because using a mutual boss for personal leave might not be appropriate, especially since they work in different departments. Also, he didn't want to go on an overseas trip and prefers to relax at home. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he argues that she should have asked first.\n\nIn terms of consent, it's clear that the man didn't agree to the trip. Even though she paid for it, the fact that he didn't want to go is important. Surprise gifts can be nice, but when they involve significant personal decisions like vacation time, consent is necessary. The girlfriend overstepped by not discussing it with him, especially since it affects his work and personal preferences. \n\nProfessionally, using a mutual boss to coordinate leave without the employee's knowledge could be problematic. It might lead to issues with HR or the company's policies, especially if other employees find out. The man's concern about jeopardizing his career is valid here. \n\nThe man's decision to decline the trip because he wasn't asked first is about respecting his own boundaries. His friends' advice that he's being ungrateful might stem from a perspective that appreciates the effort, but the core issue is whether the trip was planned without his input. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the man isn't in the wrong for refusing. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
