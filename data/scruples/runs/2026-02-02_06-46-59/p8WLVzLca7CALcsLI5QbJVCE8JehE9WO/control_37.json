Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation, paid for it, and told the author's boss in advance without asking him. The author is upset because he didn't get to choose and feels it's unprofessional to use their boss for leave without prior discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend used company resources (talking to their boss) to plan this trip. The author didn't agree to it, and he prefers to spend the time relaxing at home. He refused, leading to her being upset. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nIs the author wrong for refusing? Well, the girlfriend did a few things without his consent. She used their boss without consulting him, which could be a problem. Also, she made a significant decision about his leave time, which is his personal time. Even though the trip was a surprise, the way she went about it might have overstepped. The author has the right to his own time and preferences. By not asking first, she assumed his availability and interest in traveling, which he clearly doesn't share. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend did plan the trip and incurred expenses. However, the main issue is whether she respected his autonomy. The author isn't ungrateful for the gesture, but the method was wrong. He's justified in wanting to spend his leave how he wants. The fact that she told the boss without asking could be a big issue in their professional environment, possibly affecting both their careers. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. He has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
