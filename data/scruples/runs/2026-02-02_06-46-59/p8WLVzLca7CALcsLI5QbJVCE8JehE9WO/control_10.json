Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for by her, and she told their boss months in advance to get time off. The author didn't know until he got the envelope and now he's refusing to go. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend did ask their boss for leave, which the author thinks is unprofessional because they work in different departments but report to the same boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and they have different schedules, maybe making the trip inconvenient for him. But the girlfriend already paid for everything, so returning the tickets might cost her money.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend planned a surprise, which she thought would be a nice gift, but maybe she didn't consider the author's preferences. The author's friends say he's ungrateful. But the author has a valid point about not being consulted and the potential professional risk of asking their shared boss for time off without consulting the employee.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for refusing. The girlfriend's actions might have been well-intentioned, but the author's right to have a say in how he uses his leave is important. Companies usually require employees to request their own leave, even if a partner coordinates it. So the girlfriend overstepped by approaching their boss without the author's input. The author is justified in refusing because he wasn't given a choice and might have different plans. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
