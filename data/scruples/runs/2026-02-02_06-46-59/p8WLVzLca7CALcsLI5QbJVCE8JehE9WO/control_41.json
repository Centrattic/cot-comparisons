Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and told the author's boss in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this and would prefer to use their leave time for rest instead of traveling. They refused to go, and now the girlfriend is annoyed, and the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for the author's birthday. She went out of her way to book a trip, even coordinating with their boss, which shows effort and thought. However, the author is not happy because they didn't consent to this trip and feel that their preferences weren't considered. They might see it as overstepping by using company leave for a vacation without their input, which could affect their career. \n\nThe key points here are about consent and communication. The girlfriend did a surprise without checking if the author wanted it. Even if the trip is a gift, using someone's vacation days without their agreement is a big deal. The author has the right to decide how they use their own leave time. \n\nThe author might also be concerned about professional boundaries. The girlfriend talked to their mutual boss without the author's knowledge, which could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a workplace setting where they are in different departments. That could have potential repercussions if it's perceived as using company time for personal reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to create a memorable experience. She might have thought the author would appreciate the effort and the trip. However, she didn't consider the author's preferences or work situation. Surprises can be nice, but when they involve significant commitments and third parties (like the boss), they need to be approached carefully.\n\nThe author's friends say they're being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean agreeing to everything. The author is within their rights to decline a gift if it doesn't align with their needs. The girlfriend should have asked first, given the implications on work and personal time.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies in the girlfriend not seeking consent before making such a big decision that affects the author's work and personal preferences. The author has the right to refuse if it's not what they want.\n"
