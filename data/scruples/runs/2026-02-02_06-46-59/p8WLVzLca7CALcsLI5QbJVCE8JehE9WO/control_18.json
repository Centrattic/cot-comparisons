Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, bought the tickets, and got their boss's approval for time off without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't want to take a couples' trip, prefers to relax and sleep instead, and thinks the way she handled it was unprofessional. He refused, now she's annoyed, and friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend made decisions without consulting him, used their boss's time without his input, and he feels it's unprofessional. The author didn't want to use his leave for travel. The girlfriend already paid, so there's financial commitment. The question is about whether he's wrong for saying no.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's actions might be seen as thoughtful and extravagant. She wanted to do something nice for his birthday, and went ahead to make it happen. Maybe she thought he would like it. She did check with their boss, so maybe she was trying to make sure the leave was approved. But she didn't ask him directly, which is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns. Using company leave without discussing it with him is a big deal. Work schedules and leave should be something both people agree on, especially if it's for a trip. The author's preference to relax and sleep is his right. Also, the way she approached the boss without his input could be seen as overstepping, especially since they work in the same company. It might look like she's using company resources inappropriately.\n\nThe author's refusal is about respecting his boundaries. He didn't want to go, so he said no. The girlfriend's friends are saying he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to do something you don't want. The girlfriend should have discussed the plans first. Even though she paid for everything, that doesn't mean he has to go. The author's right to make his own choices is important here.\n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend didn't consult him and the author is within his rights to refuse, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main issue is consent and communication. The girlfriend's actions were presumptuous, and the author is justified in standing by his decision.\n"
