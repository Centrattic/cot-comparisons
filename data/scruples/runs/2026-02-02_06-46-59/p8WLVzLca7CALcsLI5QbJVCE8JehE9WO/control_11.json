Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She talked to their mutual boss in advance, which he found unprofessional. The main issues here are: the surprise nature of the trip, using company leave without his consent, and the potential risks to his career by involving their boss like that.\n\nHe didn't want to take a vacation, preferring to relax at home. The girlfriend paid for everything, so returning the tickets might incur fees. He told her he's not going because she didn't ask first. Now she's upset, and his friends think he's ungrateful.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend made a generous gesture, planning something exciting. On the other, she didn't check with him, which is a big deal. Using company leave and involving their boss without his knowledge could be a problem. He has legitimate concerns about professionalism and personal preferences.\n\nIs he wrong for prioritizing his own wishes? Maybe not. People have different vacation preferences. But the surprise aspect and not involving him in the decision-making could be the main points. The girlfriend should have discussed it first, especially since it involves work leave. So, he's not in the wrong for refusing. Answer B.\n"
