Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland. She used their mutual boss to coordinate the time off without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't know about it beforehand and would prefer to use his leave to relax and sleep. He also thinks it's unprofessional for her to involve their boss without his input.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision that affects the author without his agreement. While the surprise might have been thoughtful, she didn't consider his preferences. The author's main issue is that he wasn't asked, which is a valid concern. People have different ideas about how to spend their time off, and it's important to respect each other's wishes.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially involving their boss without the author's knowledge. That could indeed be a professional risk. The author is within his rights to decline if he's not comfortable with the trip. His friends saying he's ungrateful might not be considering his valid reasons.\n\nSo, the key point is whether the author's refusal is justified. Since the girlfriend didn't ask him, his refusal isn't inconsiderate but rather a standing up for his own preferences. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
