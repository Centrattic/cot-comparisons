Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise trip arranged by his girlfriend. The main points are: the girlfriend booked a vacation using company leave without the author's input, and he's upset because he didn't want to go on a trip and preferred to relax at home.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend did plan this surprise. She went ahead and booked everything, even talking to their boss. The author is upset because he feels she should have asked him first. But she did plan it as a surprise, so maybe she thought it was a nice gesture. However, using company leave for a trip without consulting him might be an issue. \n\nHe's not against the trip itself but the method of taking leave and the lack of communication. But he didn't like the idea of using work leave for a couples' trip, which could look unprofessional. Also, he mentions he prefers to relax and sleep, so maybe he's not really into traveling. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends say he's ungrateful. But is he wrong for not being excited about a trip he didn't ask for? The key points are consent and communication. He didn't want the trip and felt she overstepped by arranging it without asking. Even though she paid for it and might have cancellation fees, the main issue is that he didn't agree to the trip or the leave time. \n\nThe company policies might matter here too. Using leave for a trip could be a red flag if they both work in the same company, even in different branches. The author is justified in feeling that his girlfriend made a unilateral decision that affects his professional life.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not into the trip and feels it's unprofessional, he's not wrong for refusing. He communicated his reasons, which are valid. However, he could have been more appreciative of the gesture while still declining. But the main issue is her not asking him first. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
