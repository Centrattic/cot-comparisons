Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation arranged by his girlfriend. The author's main points are that the trip was planned without his input, the boss was involved in a way he considers unprofessional, and he prefers to use his leave for relaxation instead. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend paid for the trip, including flights and a resort. The author didn't like that she went to their mutual boss to get the leave without consulting him. He feels she should have asked first because using the vacation time for an overseas trip might be unprofessional, and he's not interested in traveling. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nHmm, so from the author's perspective, he's upset because his preferences weren't considered. He might feel his autonomy was disregarded. On the other hand, the girlfriend did plan a surprise, which is meant to be a nice gesture, and she went through the effort to arrange everything. She might feel hurt that he's rejecting it without being more appreciative.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did say he's not interested in the trip. But maybe he could have been more appreciative of the gesture, even if he declined. However, the key issue is that she arranged the trip without his consent, which is a big deal. He has the right to decide how to use his vacation time. The fact that she involved their boss might add to the unprofessionalism he's concerned about. So, while he might have a valid point about the lack of consultation, maybe he could have handled the refusal more gracefully. But ultimately, the main wrong here is her not asking him first. So he's not in the wrong for refusing, but perhaps his reaction could have been better. Wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the one who skipped the consultation, then he's not the one at fault. So answer B.\n"
