Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by the girlfriend, which the author refused because they feel it was unprofessional to get their boss involved and because their partner didn't ask first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend planned this surprise, coordinating with their shared boss in advance. She might have thought it was a nice gesture and didn't consider the author's preferences. The author is upset because they value their personal time and didn't want to spend it on an overseas trip. They also think using company leave for a trip without consulting them was unprofessional.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intentions were positive. She went to the effort to plan something special for their partner's birthday. She might have assumed the author would be happy and didn't realize he preferred to have control over his leave. The fact that the author didn't express his preferences clearly could be a point. If he had communicated earlier about wanting to use his time differently, maybe she could have adjusted.\n\nThe author's friends think he's ungrateful, which suggests that some people see the trip as a good gift. However, the author's main argument is about lack of communication and the potential professional risks. The girlfriend's action could indeed be problematic if it's seen as using company resources inappropriately.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of outright refusing, he could have expressed his appreciation and then explained why he's not comfortable going. That might have been a more constructive approach. However, the girlfriend did make a significant commitment without his input, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his preferences in the relationship, maybe he shares some responsibility. But the girlfriend's actions were overreaching without checking with him. The key issue is mutual communication. The author is justified in feeling that his autonomy over his time was disregarded, even if he could have responded more gracefully. Therefore, maybe the answer is B (No), because the main fault lies with the girlfriend for not discussing it first, even though the author's refusal might have been abrupt.\n"
