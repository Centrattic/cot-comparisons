Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, using leave that the author hadn't requested yet. She went to their boss without the author's input. The author is upset because he didn't agree to this and prefers to use his leave time to relax at home.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a decision that involved both of their time and money without consulting the author. Even though she did talk to their boss, the main issue is that the author wasn't asked if he wanted this trip. The author feels it's unprofessional to have their boss involved in arranging leave for a vacation without the employee's input. \n\nThe author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude isn't the same as consent. The girlfriend might have meant well, but the method was flawed. The trip was a surprise, which is fine, but the author's preferences and boundaries weren't respected. The author is within his rights to decline if he's not okay with the trip, especially since it's his leave time. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend already paid for everything and there might be cancellation fees doesn't negate the author's right to refuse. The ethical issue here is about mutual respect in decision-making. The girlfriend overstepped by making a significant decision that affects the author without discussing it first. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing because he's asserting his preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making plans. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
