Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend surprised him with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go because she didn't consult him, and he didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip. He's upset that she involved their mutual boss in getting leave, which he found unprofessional.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned this surprise, which she paid for, and she had to coordinate with their boss. The author is upset because he wasn't consulted, and he thinks it's unprofessional to ask their boss for leave for a couples' trip. He prefers to relax and sleep during his leave instead of traveling. His friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering the arguments for AITA. The main issue is consent and communication. The girlfriend made a significant decision without discussing it with him, even though it involved his work leave. Using company leave for a trip without his input could be seen as overstepping, especially since it's a major commitment. Also, coordinating with their boss without his knowledge might have potential workplace implications, which he's rightly concerned about.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did put effort into planning the trip and incurred costs. She might have thought it was a generous gesture, and the author's refusal could be perceived as unappreciative. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The core of the issue is whether the girlfriend's actions were appropriate without his consent. Since he didn't agree to the trip and has valid reasons for not wanting to go, his refusal is justified. He has the right to decide how he uses his personal leave time. The girlfriend should have discussed the plan with him first.\n\nThe author's friends think he's being ungrateful, but gratitude shouldn't override personal preferences and boundaries. The girlfriend's mistake was not consulting him, leading to a situation where the author is now expected to go on a trip he doesn't want. The author making his feelings known is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't seek his input, and he's asserting his right to use his leave as he chooses.\n"
