Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go because she didn't ask him first and he doesn't want to travel overseas.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip, got approval from their boss (they both report to the same big boss), and paid for everything. The author is upset because he didn't get to choose and he's not into overseas travel. He wanted to relax and sleep instead. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked him first.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not going. Let me think about both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend did plan this surprise, maybe expecting him to be happy. She used company leave, which might have been tricky since they work in different departments. She even talked to their boss months ahead. The author didn't like the trip and thought she should have discussed it with him. Not being asked is a big issue here. People usually expect consent for major decisions, especially when it affects their personal time and job. Also, the fact that she didn't ask might have made him feel disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something nice, and maybe she assumed he'd like the trip. She went through the trouble of getting the leave approved and paying for everything. The author's refusal could seem ungrateful, especially if she put in a lot of effort. His friends think he's being ungrateful, which adds another layer. But maybe her approach was wrong in not discussing it first. \n\nThe author's point about using leave for overseas travel versus just relaxing at home is valid. People have different preferences for their free time. The girlfriend might not have considered that. Also, using couples' leave could be seen as unprofessional if it's not properly handled, but she did get approval. \n\nSo, who is at fault here? The author could argue that his girlfriend shouldn't have made the decision without him, especially regarding his personal time. The girlfriend might feel her gesture was spoiled by his refusal. The act of not seeking consent is a problem, but the effort she put into planning might make the author's refusal seem harsh. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a key factor. The author has a right to his own preferences about travel. Even though the trip was planned with good intentions, the way it was done without discussion is problematic. Therefore, the author isn't entirely wrong for refusing. But he might be in the wrong if he didn't express his concerns before the trip was booked. However, he didn't have a chance to say no. \n\nWait, he didn't say anything until she asked why he was unhappy. So he might have acted passive-aggressively. But his reason is valid. The girlfriend should have discussed it first. So, the author's stance is more about respecting his autonomy. His friends calling him ungrateful might not be fair because he's within his right to decline. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making plans. So the answer is B.\n"
