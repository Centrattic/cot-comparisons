Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend surprising him with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, which she arranged by consulting their mutual boss without his knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't know about the trip until it was presented as a surprise. The girlfriend used company procedures by talking to their boss, which the author finds unprofessional because it's for a personal trip. He also mentions he doesn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and prefers to relax at home. He refused the trip because she didn't ask first, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions involved using company resources (talking to the boss) and making a decision without his input. The author's main issues are about unprofessionalism, lack of consent, and his personal preference. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, planning a surprise trip without discussing it might be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend had a good intention but didn't consider his feelings or preferences. However, the author's refusal might come off as ungrateful, especially since she went through the effort and expense. \n\nThe girlfriend's action of talking to their boss might be problematic if it's against company policy to coordinate leave for personal trips. The author is right to be concerned about how it could affect their careers. However, the surprise itself and not checking with him could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't express his preferences before the trip was planned. He could have communicated his desire to have a different kind of vacation or to not use leave for travel. But by the time he realized, the trip was already booked, making it hard to decline without causing hurt feelings. \n\nThe friends' opinion that he's ungrateful suggests that society might expect him to accept the trip as a gift. However, personal boundaries and personal preferences are important. The author's stance is about respecting his own wishes and being involved in the decision-making. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author's refusal is justified. He had valid reasons: unprofessionalism in securing leave and lack of prior discussion. But the girlfriend's intention was to surprise him with something nice. The conflict arises from differing values and communication styles. \n\nIn such cases, the line between being considerate and being inconsiderate can be blurry. If the girlfriend had discussed the trip beforehand, the author could have voiced his concerns. But since she didn't, her action, while well-meaning, might have been careless. \n\nSo, the author's refusal is based on legitimate concerns about his career and personal preferences. However, his reaction might be perceived as unappreciative, especially since she took the initiative. The question is whether his reasons outweigh the social expectation to accept a generous gift. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's standing by his personal boundaries and professional concerns. However, his communication of those reasons could have been more empathetic. The girlfriend also made a mistake by not checking with him first. But since the user's friends are telling him he's wrong, it's a toss-up. I think the answer leans towards A (in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were a surprise, but he could have handled it more gracefully. Alternatively, considering the professional aspect, maybe B (not in the wrong). Hmm. This is tricky. I need to decide based on the main points: the girlfriend's unprofessional move and lack of consent versus the author's refusal as ungrateful. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing. If the girlfriend's actions were inappropriate, then the author's refusal is justified. But if the trip was a genuine surprise without malice, maybe the author is being too rigid. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because he has valid reasons to be concerned about professional conduct and personal preferences.\n"
