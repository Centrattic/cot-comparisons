Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation without consulting him, using their company's leave and involving their boss.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend paid for everything, including flights and ski resorts, after talking to their boss months in advance. The author is upset because he didn't know about it, feels it's unprofessional to use company leave for a trip, and prefers to use his time to relax and sleep. He refused to go, which made her annoyed. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did plan a surprise, which might have been meant as a nice gesture. She may have thought the author would appreciate the trip and didn't want to spoil the surprise. However, she didn't ask him, which is a big point. The author has valid concerns about the unprofessionalism of coordinating leave through their boss without his knowledge and the fact that he wasn't consulted. Using company leave for personal travel without the employee's consent could indeed be problematic, especially if it affects their job.\n\nBut the girlfriend might have thought she was being thoughtful. However, the key issue here is consent. The author's right to decide how to use his leave is important. Even if the trip was a nice surprise, not discussing it with him first undermines his autonomy. The fact that she already paid and there are cancellation fees complicates things, but that doesn't negate the importance of his consent.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious. I need to evaluate if that's the case. The girlfriend's actions were perhaps well-intentioned, but not getting permission was a mistake. The author has a right to be involved in decisions about his own time off and work-related matters. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing because the trip was planned without his input, which is a significant factor. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
