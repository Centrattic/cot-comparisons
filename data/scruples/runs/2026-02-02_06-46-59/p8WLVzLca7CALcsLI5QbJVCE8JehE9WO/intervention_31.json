Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising him with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't ask him first and he didn't want to take that kind of trip.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The girlfriend went to the effort of arranging the trip, probably thinking it's something the guy would enjoy. She used their boss's approval without consulting him, which might be a problem. The author is upset because he didn't get to choose, and he feels it's unprofessional to have his leave used without his input. Also, he prefers to relax at home instead of going on an overseas vacation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something nice, and the author's refusal could come off as ungrateful. His friends say he's being ungrateful. But the key point here is that she didn't ask him first. Using company leave, even if it's approved, without discussing with him might be a big mistake. The author has the right to decide how he uses his own vacation time. Even though the trip is paid for, he's within his rights to decline if it's not what he wants. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's being ungrateful for not wanting to go, maybe. But if he's just asserting his autonomy over his leave, then he's not. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because she didn't get his consent. But maybe some would say he should be more appreciative. It's a bit of a grey area, but the main issue is consent and respecting his choice.\n"
