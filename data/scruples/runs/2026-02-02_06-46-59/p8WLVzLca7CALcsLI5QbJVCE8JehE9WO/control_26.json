Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, using her connections to talk to their boss months in advance without consulting him. He didn't like it because he thought it was unprofessional and didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip. He refused to go, and now she's upset. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did surprise him with a nice gift, using her HR position to arrange time off, which might be a big deal. But the guy is right to be concerned about how she got the leave. Asking their mutual boss for couples' leave could be seen as inappropriate, especially if they work in different departments. Also, he didn't know about the plans and wasn't asked if he wanted to go. That's a point in his favor\u2014he has the right to decide how he uses his vacation time.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something nice, and maybe she assumed he would enjoy it. But she didn't get his input, which is important. Vacation time is personal, and using it for something he wasn't comfortable with could be an issue. Also, the fact that she already paid for everything and there might be cancellation fees complicates things, but that doesn't mean he has to go if he's not happy about it.\n\nThe key points here are consent and professional boundaries. She didn't ask him, which is a big problem. His job is in IT, different department, so maybe she overstepped by involving their boss. He's justified in feeling that she shouldn't have made such a big decision without his input. His friends calling him ungrateful might be missing the fact that he's not ungrateful for the gesture, but for the way it was handled.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has valid reasons for refusing. She should have discussed the plans with him before making arrangements. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
