Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend surprising the author with a paid vacation to Switzerland, which she arranged without consulting him, even getting his boss's approval without his knowledge.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The girlfriend planned a two-week trip, paid for everything, and got leave approved through their mutual boss. The author is upset because he didn't know about it, didn't want to take time off for a vacation, and prefers to use his leave for relaxation at home. He refused to go, and now the girlfriend is upset, and friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the main issue is whether the girlfriend overstepped by making a major life decision (taking two weeks of leave for a trip) without consulting him. Even though she did it as a surprise, using company leave and involving their boss without his input might be a problem. The author has valid concerns about professionalism\u2014using company leave for a couples' trip without his consent could indeed look bad, especially since they work under the same boss. Also, personal preferences matter. He's clear he doesn't want to travel and would prefer to relax at home. The girlfriend didn't consider his wishes, which is a red flag in any relationship. Surprises can be nice, but they shouldn't override someone's autonomy, especially when it affects their job. Friends saying he's ungrateful might not see the lack of communication. The author isn't rejecting a gift out of spite; he's standing up for his boundaries. So, he's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
