Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation that the girlfriend paid for, which was arranged with their mutual boss.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend did something without consulting the author. She booked a two-week trip to Switzerland, used her position in HR to talk to their boss in advance, and didn't check with him if he wanted to go. The author is upset because this could be unprofessional and he would prefer to relax at home. He refuses to go, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and communication. The author feels his preferences were ignored. The girlfriend's surprise, while thoughtful, didn't consider his personal wishes. The friends say he's ungrateful, but the main issue is whether the girlfriend overstepped by making a major life decision without his input.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that using the leave for an overseas trip might affect his career. Even though the boss was involved, the author's preference is to use the time to rest. The fact that the girlfriend didn't ask first is a red flag. In relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and preferences is important. The surprise was nice, but the method was problematic.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set his own boundaries. He has a valid reason to decline. The girlfriend should have discussed it first. The answer is B (No).\n"
