Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation, paid for it, and told the author that their boss was informed in advance. The author didn't like the idea because they feel it's unprofessional to use two weeks of leave for a trip, especially without discussing it first. The friends say the author is being ungrateful, but the author thinks the girlfriend should have asked them first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for her partner, which is a common gesture. She went through the trouble of planning something, maybe thinking it would be a great birthday surprise. She did talk to the boss ahead of time, which might be a big step, so she probably believed it was okay. However, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to refuse without discussing it, especially since he didn't like the idea of using his leave that way.\n\nThe author's argument is about personal preference and professional concerns. He mentions he would prefer to use the leave time to relax and sleep instead of traveling. That's a valid personal choice. He's also worried about the unprofessionalism of taking couples' leave. But does that justify refusing the surprise? Maybe not entirely. The girlfriend might have thought she was acting in good faith to make him happy, and the fact that he didn't express enthusiasm hurt her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that his partner didn't respect his autonomy in making decisions about his own leave. Even though the girlfriend arranged it, the key point is whether she should have discussed the plans with him first. The author's right to make decisions about his time off is important. The girlfriend took a big step without consulting him, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for refusing to go because he didn't like the surprise? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for not asking him first? The friends think the author is being ungrateful. But gratitude might not be the only factor here. The author's right to control his own schedule is a significant point. The girlfriend's action, while well-intentioned, might have been a breach of his autonomy. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend did go through the process of talking to their boss, which shows she put in effort. But maybe she should have discussed it with him first instead of just informing him after the fact. The author's reaction could be seen as standing up for his own preferences, which is valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's surprise might have been a nice gesture, but without communication, it led to conflict. The author's refusal is based on his personal and professional boundaries. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his own needs. Alternatively, maybe both have some responsibility here. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer would depend on whether the act of surprising without consulting is considered wrong. Since the author clearly states that he would prefer not to travel and the girlfriend didn't ask, the author might be in the right to decline. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
