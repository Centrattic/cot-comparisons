Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation arranged by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend surprised him with a two-week trip to Switzerland. She booked it without consulting him and told their mutual boss in advance. The author is upset because she didn't ask if he wanted to go, and he feels it's unprofessional to have their boss involved in personal leave for a vacation, which could affect his career. He also prefers to relax at home instead of traveling.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the girlfriend overstep by not discussing the trip with him first? Is the author justified in refusing because of his personal preferences and career concerns?\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend did something nice, but without his input. It's important in relationships to communicate and respect each other's preferences. The fact that she went to their boss without his knowledge might be a significant issue, depending on their workplace policies. If the company allows such arrangements, maybe it's okay, but if not, that could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't express his preferences about travel before the trip was arranged. Maybe he should have been more open about his desire to not travel. But the girlfriend's approach was to surprise him, which might not consider his personal boundaries. By not asking, she assumed he would want to go, which might not be the case. \n\nAlso, the author's concern about it being unprofessional is valid if that's a real policy in their workplace. However, if the boss approved it, maybe it's okay. Still, the method of getting leave without the author's consent could be problematic.\n\nThe friends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean sacrificing one's personal preferences or career. The author has the right to refuse if it makes him uncomfortable. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making plans, especially something as significant as two weeks off and international travel.\n\nSo, considering all this, the girlfriend made a mistake by not consulting him, and the author is right to refuse. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
