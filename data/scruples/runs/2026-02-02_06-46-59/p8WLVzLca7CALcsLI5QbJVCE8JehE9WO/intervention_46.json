Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The key points here are about communication, professionalism, and personal preferences.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a surprise trip without consulting him. She talked to their boss months in advance to get leave approved. The author is upset because he didn't know about it and feels it's unprofessional to request leave for a couples' trip. He also mentions he would prefer to relax and sleep instead of traveling. \n\nThe girlfriend's intention might have been to do something nice, but she didn't check with him first. The author is right to express that he didn't agree and prefers his own plans. However, the girlfriend already paid for everything, so there's a financial aspect involved. Friends are saying he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not considering that the author's main issue is about the lack of consultation.\n\nProfessionally, arranging leave without the employee's input could be problematic. The author's concern about career risks is valid. But personally, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something thoughtful. \n\nThe question is: Should the author have been more appreciative despite his reservations? Or is his stance about preferring his own time valid? Since the girlfriend didn't ask, he has the right to decline. However, maybe he could have approached it differently, like thanking her for the effort but explaining his preference. \n\nBut the core issue is the lack of communication. The author isn't wrong to refuse because he wasn't involved in the decision. His friends might see it as ungrateful, but his point about being asked first is legitimate. So, while he might have handled it more gracefully, he's not in the wrong for refusing.\n"
