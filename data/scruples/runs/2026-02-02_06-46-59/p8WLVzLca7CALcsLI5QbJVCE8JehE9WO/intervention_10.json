Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, using both their vacation days. She didn't consult him, just told him it was a surprise after talking to their boss months in advance.\n\nThe author is upset because she didn't ask for his permission, and he feels that using company leave for a trip is unprofessional. Also, he prefers relaxing and sleeping instead. His friends are saying he's ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to plan a surprise, which she thought would be a nice gesture. She went through the effort of coordinating with their boss. On the other hand, the author values his autonomy and feels his preferences weren't respected. Using company leave for personal trips might indeed be a professional risk, especially if it's not properly approved. Also, the fact that she didn't check with him about his preferences is a key point. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach might have been well-meaning, but the author's right to make his own decisions about how to spend his time is important. The fact that he's in a different department and their lunch breaks don't align might mean they don't communicate enough, leading to misunderstandings. \n\nHe could have been more appreciative of her effort, but his main point is about consent and prior discussion. Since she didn't ask, his refusal isn't entirely without merit. However, there's a balance between respecting personal choices and appreciating the effort made. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He might not be, because he's asserting his boundaries. But he could have handled it more gracefully. The girlfriend's action was a surprise, but the key issue is consent. If he didn't want to go on the trip, not going is his right. The fact that she paid for it complicates things, but that doesn't obligate him to go if he's not comfortable. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong. He's standing up for his preferences. The friends' reaction might be harsh, but his stance is about respect for his own wishes.\n"
