Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation, paid for by her, and they had to take time off work. The key points here are: she didn't consult the author before booking, she told their mutual boss in advance without his knowledge, and he's not happy because he didn't agree to go. The author is upset because using leave for a couple's trip without his consent feels unprofessional and against his personal preference. He values relaxation and sleep over traveling.\n\nFirst, did the girlfriend overstep by booking without asking? Definitely, the author feels that way. The surprise might have been nice, but she made a big decision without his input. That's a red flag because it's a significant change to his schedule and work life. Also, informing their boss without consulting him could lead to professional issues, which the author is worried about.\n\nThe author's reaction is about his right to decide how he uses his leave. Even if the girlfriend meant well, he didn't want to go. The fact that the trip is already paid for might make it harder to back out, but he's standing by his choice. His friends think he's ungrateful, but his reasoning is valid. He's not the one who planned the trip; he's being respectful of his boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was a thoughtful surprise. But her actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, ignored his autonomy. The author is in the right to prioritize his own preferences. So, the answer would be B, meaning he's not in the wrong.\n"
