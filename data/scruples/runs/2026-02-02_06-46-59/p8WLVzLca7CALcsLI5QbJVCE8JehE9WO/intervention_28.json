Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland for the author's birthday, paid for everything, and told their boss in advance without consulting the author. The author is upset because she didn't ask first and he doesn't want to go on an overseas trip during his leave. He also thinks it's unprofessional to have asked their boss for the leave. The friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend did something nice, planned a surprise, and paid for everything. She might have thought it was a great gift and wanted to make her partner happy. However, she did it without consulting him, which is a key point. The author didn't get to say yes or no, and his preference is to relax and sleep at home. \n\nThe author's main issue is that his girlfriend didn't ask first. In relationships, communication is important. Even if the intention is good, making major decisions without discussion can be problematic. The girlfriend might have assumed he'd like it, but that's not the case. The author's career concerns about how the leave was requested are valid too. He's worried about professional repercussions, which is a real issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were motivated by love and wanting to celebrate his birthday in a special way. She went through the trouble of planning and paying for everything, which shows effort and thoughtfulness. The author's refusal could be seen as dismissing her effort, but he does have a right to his own preferences. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend didn't respect the author's autonomy by not asking first. Even if the gift is generous, it's about consent in the relationship. The author is justified in feeling upset because his preferences weren't considered. However, the way he handled it might be an issue. He didn't express his concerns until after the surprise, which could have been hurtful to her. \n\nBut the core issue is the lack of communication. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before booking and involving their boss. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his need for input. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
