Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a trip to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't ask him first and used company leave time. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend arranged a two-week vacation using their mutual boss, without consulting him. The author is upset because he didn't apply for leave, feels it's unprofessional, and doesn't want to travel overseas. He refuses the trip, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the arguments for both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but she didn't check with him, which is a problem. The author's concern is valid because using company resources without proper process could be risky. Also, personal preferences about how to spend leave time are important. He might have valid reasons to not want to travel, like needing rest instead. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt that he's not appreciative. The friends say he's ungrateful, but that's a judgment call. The main issue is whether he's wrong for refusing. The author's reasons are about respecting his own preferences and professional boundaries. The girlfriend overstepped by not involving him in the decision. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has valid concerns about work procedures and personal choice. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
