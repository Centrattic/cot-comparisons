Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author's girlfriend planned a surprise two-week vacation to Switzerland. She arranged it by talking to their mutual boss months in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because the vacation requires taking leave, which they didn't apply for themselves. They feel it's unprofessional to have the boss handle their leave for a personal trip, and also that the girlfriend didn't ask them first. The girlfriend is now annoyed because the author refused to go, and friends are saying he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend used company resources (the boss) to arrange leave without the author's consent, and she didn't consult him about the trip. The author is concerned about professionalism and personal preference.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend did a surprise without checking with him. The author has valid reasons: using their boss for personal leave without their input could be a professional issue, and the author has his own preferences about how to spend time off. The girlfriend's actions were overstepping by not getting his permission, even if it was a nice gesture. The author's refusal is based on legitimate concerns about work procedures and personal choice. The friends' opinion that he's ungrateful might overlook the fact that he didn't know about the arrangement until it was done. So, the author isn't wrong for standing up for his boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
