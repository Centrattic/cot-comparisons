Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to go on a surprise vacation that his girlfriend paid for, which was arranged with their boss. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend surprised him with flights and a resort stay in Switzerland for two weeks. She told him she had already talked to their boss months in advance to get leave. The author is upset because he thinks it's unprofessional to ask their boss for leave for a couples' trip, and he didn't want to go overseas. He didn't like that she didn't ask him first and now he's refusing to go. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the girlfriend did plan this without consulting him, which is a problem. In a relationship, major decisions like this should involve both people. She used his leave time, which he didn't agree to. That's a point for the author. Also, coordinating with their boss for leave, especially for a personal trip, might be unprofessional, especially since they work for the same company. That could be a risk for both of them. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend did put in the effort and money, and maybe she thought it would be a nice surprise. The author didn't express his preferences until after the surprise was presented, and now he's backing out. That might come off as ungrateful. However, the key issue is consent. He didn't want to go, so she shouldn't have planned it without his input. \n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, the fact that she didn't ask him first is a big deal. He has a right to his own preferences about how to spend his leave. The problem is that she made a decision that affects him without his consent. So maybe he's not in the wrong for refusing. But some might argue he should have been more appreciative and then discussed it. But the main issue is that she didn't check with him. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for standing by his decision. \n\nSo the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
