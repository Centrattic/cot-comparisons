Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. The key points here are the surprise aspect, the fact that the girlfriend arranged it without consulting him, and the author's reasons for declining.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned the trip as a surprise, which she did by coordinating with their boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he feels it's unprofessional to have the boss involved in arranging leave for a personal trip. Also, he prefers to use his leave time for relaxation and sleep, not traveling overseas. His friends think he's being ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nSo, who's right? Let's break it down. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, which is understandable. However, she made a major decision that affects the author without consulting him. Even if she thought it was a surprise, she should have considered his preferences. The fact that she went to their boss without his knowledge might have crossed a line, especially in a professional setting where such actions could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nOn the author's side, he has valid concerns. Using company leave for a personal trip, even if arranged secretly, might not be something he's comfortable with. Plus, he wasn't consulted, which shows a lack of respect for his autonomy. However, he also didn't express his gratitude or try to work it out, which his friends point out as being ungrateful.\n\nThe crux here is the lack of communication. The girlfriend, while well-meaning, didn't check with him, and the author, while right in wanting to be consulted, might have handled the situation better by expressing appreciation and discussing alternatives rather than outright refusing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did refuse a gift without considering the feelings of the giver and the effort involved. However, his right to make decisions about his own leave and personal preferences is valid. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making arrangements. In terms of fault, both have some responsibility, but the initial mistake lies with the girlfriend for not seeking consent. The author's refusal is a reaction to that, so perhaps he's not entirely at fault. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the context of not being asked first and the professional implications, maybe the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
