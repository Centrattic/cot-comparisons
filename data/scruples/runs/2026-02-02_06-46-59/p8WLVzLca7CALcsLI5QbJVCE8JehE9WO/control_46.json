Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, using their company's leave, and didn't consult him first.\n\nFirst, the author's main points: He's not thrilled about the surprise because he didn't know about it beforehand. He's concerned about professional implications\u2014using leave for a ski trip might look unprofessional, especially since they report to the same boss. Also, he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep rather than travel. He didn't want to go, so he declined, and now his girlfriend is upset. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend planned this as a surprise, which is a common way to show love. She went ahead and booked everything, including flights and resorts, which were paid for. She told their boss in advance, so maybe she thought she was doing a thoughtful thing. The author's refusal might make her feel her gesture was wasted or unappreciated.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not obligated to accept gifts. Ethically, it's about mutual respect. The girlfriend didn't ask, but she did plan a nice trip. The author has valid reasons: professional concerns and personal preferences. However, the way he refused without considering her feelings could be an issue. He could have thanked her for the gesture and explained his reasons instead of outright refusing. But the core issue is whether he's wrong for not going. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were a bit presumptuous. She used company leave, which the author might not be comfortable with. The author's right to make his own decisions about his time is valid. So while he could have handled it better, the main issue is her not consulting him. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing.\n"
