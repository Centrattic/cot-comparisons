Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to go on a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She approached their mutual boss without the author's knowledge to arrange time off. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he's not interested in an overseas trip, preferring to relax and sleep instead. The friends think he's ungrateful, but he's standing by his decision.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the girlfriend did spend money and plan without his input. He has a right to prefer his own vacation, right? But maybe he should have communicated his preferences earlier? However, she didn't consult him, which is a big issue. She made a major decision that affects him without his consent. That seems unfair. Also, using their mutual boss for personal leave might be a problem, but that's more on her. The author's stance is about his personal preference and boundaries. Friends calling him ungrateful might not be right because the surprise wasn't coordinated with him. So the author isn't in the wrong for declining. Answer B.\n"
