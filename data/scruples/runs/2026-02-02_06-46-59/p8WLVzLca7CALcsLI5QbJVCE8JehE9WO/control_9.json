Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author of the post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for their birthday, paid for it, and coordinated with their mutual boss to get time off without consulting the author.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because the girlfriend didn't ask for his input. They feel that asking their boss for leave, especially for an overseas trip, is unprofessional and could affect his career. The girlfriend took the initiative without discussing it with him, which is a big deal. The author prefers to take his time off to relax and sleep, not travel, so the surprise doesn't align with his preferences. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is key. The girlfriend wanted to make it a surprise, which she did, but the author feels that important decisions regarding his work and personal time should involve him. The friends say he's ungrateful, but the author's point is about lack of consent rather than ungratitude. \n\nIs the author wrong for refusing? Well, he had valid reasons: professional concerns and personal preferences. The girlfriend didn't check with him, which is a communication breakdown. However, the girlfriend did plan something nice, which he might need to acknowledge. But the main issue is whether he's obligated to go despite his objections. Since the author has the right to make decisions about his own time and work, his refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making decisions that affect him. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had legitimate reasons and the girlfriend should have involved him in the planning. The key here is that major decisions affecting the author's work and personal preferences require mutual agreement, not unilateral action.\n"
