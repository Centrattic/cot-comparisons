Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, arranged without his input, and he's refusing to go because she didn't ask him first. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend planned this surprise, using their boss who they both report to. She probably did it to make his birthday special, and she paid for everything. She might have thought he would love the trip and wanted to create a memorable experience. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because he didn't ask for this trip. He works in IT, and using leave for a two-week trip might be a big deal. He prefers to relax and sleep at home instead of traveling. Also, he's concerned about the unprofessional aspect of their boss being involved without his knowledge. Plus, if he refuses, she might face cancellation fees, which could be a financial loss.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to go, even though it's using his leave. His leave time is his to manage, and she made a decision that affects him without his input. That's a boundary issue. However, she did go through the trouble of planning it, and her intention was to surprise him with something nice.\n\nBut the main issue is that he didn't agree to the trip. Even if it's a surprise, the decision to use his leave should involve him. The fact that she used their boss without his knowledge adds another layer of unprofessionalism, which he's justified in being upset about. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he's not obligated to accept a gift if it's causing him stress or conflict.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong in refusing because his consent was necessary for using his leave. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
