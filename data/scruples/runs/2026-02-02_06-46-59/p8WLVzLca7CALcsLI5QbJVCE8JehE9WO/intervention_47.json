Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, who works in HR, surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland. She had already arranged it with their boss without asking him first. The author is upset because he didn't want an overseas trip and felt it was unprofessional to approach their boss for couple's leave without his input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main points are that he wasn't consulted, and he's concerned about the professionalism of the arrangement. The girlfriend probably intended to do something nice, but she made a big decision without his input. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being romantic and had planned it well in advance, even coordinating with their boss. She might have assumed he'd be happy to have a trip together.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether it's wrong for the author to refuse the trip. The author is not wrong for feeling that his input should be considered. When someone spends money on a trip for another person, especially when it involves work-related leave, the recipient has the right to say no if it's not what they want. The girlfriend didn't ask, which could be seen as a breach of communication. The author's friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to accept something you don't want. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been overstepping by making a significant decision without his consent. The author is within his rights to decline, especially since he has valid reasons related to work and personal preferences. The fact that the trip is already booked adds complications, but that doesn't obligate him to go. The main wrong here would be if the author was being unkind or unappreciative, but he's explaining his reasons clearly. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. He has legitimate concerns about professional boundaries and personal preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
