Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a surprise vacation arranged by his girlfriend without consulting him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip, paid for it, and even coordinated with their mutual boss. She did this without asking him first. The author is upset because he didn't want an overseas trip and prefers to relax at home. He also thinks it's unprofessional to involve the boss about personal leave without his knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt because he didn't express interest in the trip, which she put effort into. Her friends say he's being ungrateful. So, the key points are about consent and communication. Did the girlfriend overstep by making the decision without him? The author didn't like the trip, so maybe it was a mistake to plan it secretly. But she did do a lot to make it happen, which shows she wanted to do something nice. However, in relationships, it's important to consider each other's preferences. If he didn't want to go, even if she had plans, he's right to refuse. But maybe he could have been more appreciative of the effort she made, even if he declined. \n\nIs he wrong for not going? Or is she wrong for not asking? The main issue is the lack of communication. Since he didn't want to go, he's not in the wrong for declining. She might have miscalculated by not discussing it first. However, he could have been more grateful for her effort, even if he refused. But the core issue is her not consulting him. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's some middle ground. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong because he had legitimate reasons to refuse, and she should have discussed it with him first. Friends saying he's ungrateful don't consider his perspective.\n"
