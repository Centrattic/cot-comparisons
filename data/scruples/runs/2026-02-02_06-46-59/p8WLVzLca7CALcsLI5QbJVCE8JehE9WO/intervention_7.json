Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for his birthday, paid for it, and arranged time off with their boss without asking him first. The author is upset because he didn't want to go on an overseas trip and felt she should have discussed it with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's intentions. She surprised him with an expensive trip, which she arranged without consulting him. But the author is unhappy because he wasn't consulted and he doesn't want to take that time off for travel. He also thinks it's unprofessional to have the boss handle leave requests for a couple's trip, which could affect their careers.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without checking with him, which is a significant issue in any relationship. Deciding to spend someone's vacation time without their input is a problem because that time is personal. Also, coordinating with their boss for leave without discussing it with him could lead to workplace issues, especially since they're in different departments but report to the same boss. That might have created a conflict of interest or appear unprofessional.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend did plan the trip as a surprise, which is a common gesture. But the main issue is that she didn't ask if he wanted to go. The author's friends think he's ungrateful, but he's standing his ground because it's his time. So, is he wrong for not going? Well, he had valid reasons: he didn't agree to the trip, it's his leave time, and he's concerned about professionalism.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt because her surprise was rejected. But in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author isn't refusing the trip out of spite; he's explaining his reasons. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making arrangements. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author's main issue is that he wasn't consulted. His refusal is based on valid concerns about his personal time and professional boundaries. The girlfriend's mistake was not getting his input. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his right to make decisions about his own leave and how he spends his time. The girlfriend should have communicated better. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
