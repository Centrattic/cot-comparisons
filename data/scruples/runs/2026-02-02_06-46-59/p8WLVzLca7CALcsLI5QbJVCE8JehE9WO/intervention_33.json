Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted about refusing a surprise vacation paid by their girlfriend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland for the author's birthday. She had discussed it with their mutual boss months in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because they didn't know about the leave time being taken and didn't agree to the trip. The main issues here are the lack of communication, the professional implications of discussing leave with a boss without consulting the employee, and the author's preference to use their time differently.\n\nThe author's friends say they're being ungrateful, but the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. However, the user is seeking validation.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to surprise the author with a special gift, which is a nice gesture. But she didn't ask for the author's input, which is a key point. The author's reasons for declining are valid: using leave without consultation could be unprofessional, and the author has different preferences for relaxation. The girlfriend's approach might have been overreaching, especially involving their boss without the author's knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction could come off as dismissive or unappreciative. Surprises can be a way to show love, but the method here might have been problematic. The author's right to use their leave as they wish is important. Refusing the trip because it wasn't discussed might be about personal preference rather than a wrong action. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't say yes to a surprise, but they have valid reasons. The girlfriend's actions were the issue more so. The author is standing up for their own needs and boundaries. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
