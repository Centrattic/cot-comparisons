Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation from his girlfriend. The girlfriend got the flights and planned it without asking him first, and he's upset because she went to their boss for leave without consulting him. The key points here are about consent and how the surprise was handled.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip, which is a significant amount of time off. The author's main issues are that he wasn't asked if he wanted to use his leave and he would prefer to relax and sleep. Also, he's concerned that asking the boss for leave for a couples' trip is unprofessional and could affect his career.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for refusing? Well, the girlfriend's actions were a surprise, which might not be wrong on her part, but the author has valid concerns. He didn't have a say in planning the trip, and using his leave for something he didn't agree to could be an issue. The boss's involvement without his knowledge adds to the problem because the author might feel that his autonomy was overridden. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did spend money and plan the trip, expecting the author to be happy. The friends are saying he's ungrateful. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The author's right to control his own leave and his preference for relaxation seem important. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he has the right to his own decisions and preferences about how to spend his time off.\n"
