Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation funded by her, and the author refused to go because she didn't consult him and involved their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized flights and a trip to Switzerland, used her HR position to coordinate with their boss in advance, and the author is upset because she didn't ask him. The author feels it's unprofessional to have their boss involved in personal leave for a vacation, even though they share a boss. Also, the author prefers to relax at home instead of traveling.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask the author if he wanted to go, which the author finds problematic. The author is worried about potential career impacts from asking for leave through their shared boss. The girlfriend, on the other hand, probably thought she was doing something nice, but didn't consider the author's preferences.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's actions: she made a significant decision without consulting the author. Even if she paid for everything, the lack of communication is a key point. The author's right to make decisions about his own time and career is important. However, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she put in the effort and thought the author would be happy.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's in a situation where he needs to balance his career concerns with his relationship. He's not ungrateful for the gesture, but the method was wrong. The friends say he's being ungrateful, but maybe they're not seeing the professional angle. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons: unprofessional coordination with the boss and lack of prior discussion about travel preferences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not denying the gesture, just the method. He's asserting his own needs and boundaries, which is reasonable. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author has valid reasons related to professional and personal boundaries. The girlfriend didn't respect his autonomy in deciding how to use his leave time.\n"
