Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation booked by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and told the author's boss in advance. The key points here are that she didn't ask him first, and he's upset because he didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip. He wanted to relax and sleep instead. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he's conflicted because he didn't like the surprise and the way she handled the leave request.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author wrong for refusing? Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend did a surprise, which might be considered thoughtful and romantic. She went to great lengths to plan this, even coordinating with their boss. She might have felt she was showing love and effort. On the other hand, the author didn't get a say in the matter. He wasn't consulted about using his leave for travel, which is a significant decision. The fact that she approached their boss without consulting him could be seen as overstepping, especially since he's concerned about the professional implications. Also, using leave for travel isn't something everyone might want; he prefers to use that time to rest here.\n\nThe author's main issue is that his autonomy in deciding how to use his leave was bypassed. The girlfriend's action, while well-intentioned, might not consider his personal preferences. However, the surprise element is often part of relationships, but it's important that both parties are on the same page. The author's refusal could be seen as self-centered if the girlfriend's intent was purely to make him happy, but it's also about respecting his boundaries.\n\nI need to consider cultural or situational factors. In some contexts, a surprise vacation might be a common gesture, but if the recipient has different priorities, it's a problem. The girlfriend's actions might have been a bit presumptuous, not checking with him. However, the author didn't express his preferences beforehand, so maybe he's responsible for not communicating that he doesn't want to travel. But the girlfriend did make a significant decision without his input, which is the crux here.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author had the right to refuse. Since the leave was already taken, it's complicated. But if he's not interested in the trip, his refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend might have overstepped by securing the leave without his consent. The author's concern about professional implications is valid, as using leave for travel could be seen as less responsible than taking it for rest. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because his right to decide how to use his leave was overlooked. The girlfriend's approach was unprofessional and dismissive of his preferences. However, the author could have communicated his travel preferences earlier to avoid this situation. But given the circumstances, he's justified in refusing.\n"
