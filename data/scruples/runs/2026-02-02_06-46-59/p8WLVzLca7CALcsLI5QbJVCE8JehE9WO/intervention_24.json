Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid-for trip to Switzerland, which she arranged with their boss without consulting him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip using their mutual boss, which the author finds unprofessional. He's upset she didn't ask him first. His main objections are about the unprofessionalism of involving their boss for personal leave and not discussing the trip with him. He also mentions preferring to relax and sleep instead of traveling, which is his personal preference.\n\nNow, looking at the girlfriend's actions: she planned a surprise, which is a common gesture but might be seen as overstepping if it involves work-related decisions. However, she did arrange the leave in advance, so maybe she tried to cover that part. The author's frustration seems valid because she didn't check with him about the trip, which is a significant decision. But the trip was a gift, so expecting gratitude might be part of the situation.\n\nThe friends think the author is ungrateful. But does that make him wrong? The author has a legitimate point about the professional implications and the lack of consultation. However, he also didn't express his preferences until he refused the trip, which could be seen as not being appreciative. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author's rejection is justified. On one hand, he has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preferences. On the other, he didn't communicate his feelings until after the fact, leading to conflict. The girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned but perhaps overreaching. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. He had the right to express his preferences, even if he didn't do it sooner. The girlfriend maybe should have discussed the trip with him. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if his rejection was reasonable. Since he had concerns about the trip's unprofessionalism and his own preferences, refusing isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend should have asked, but the author acting on his beliefs isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
