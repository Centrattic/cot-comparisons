Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for declining a surprise vacation arranged by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, using the author's leave time, without discussing it with him. She approached their mutual boss ahead of time without consulting him. The author feels that taking leave for such an overseas trip is unprofessional and might affect his career. He also mentions preferring to relax at home instead of traveling. He refused to go because he felt she should have asked first, which led to her being upset.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The main issue seems to be about consent and communication. The girlfriend made a surprise by booking the trip without the author's input. While her action might come from a place of wanting to make his birthday special, she didn't consider his preferences or professional concerns. The author has valid points about using leave time for travel without his agreement, especially since they work in different departments but under the same boss. The author's job could be at risk if such actions are seen as unprofessional. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have intended to create a memorable experience and perhaps thought she was being thoughtful by handling the logistics. However, the problem arises from not discussing it with him first. The author's refusal is based on both personal preference and professional concerns, which are legitimate.\n\nThe author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't override personal boundaries or professional considerations. The girlfriend's actions, while well-meaning, were presumptuous. The author has the right to decide how he uses his leave time. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's approach was flawed because she didn't communicate with him. The author's refusal is a reasonable response to protect his own interests. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for declining, as he's asserting his autonomy regarding his time and career.\n"
