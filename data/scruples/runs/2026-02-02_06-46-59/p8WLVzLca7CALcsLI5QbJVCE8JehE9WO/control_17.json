Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation booked by his girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland. She used their mutual boss to secure the time off without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't agree to the trip and prefers to use his leave for relaxing at home. He didn't like that she involved their boss without his input and that she made plans without asking. His friends say he's being ungrateful. \n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's actions: she used company resources (the boss) to get time off, which might be unprofessional, especially since they're in different departments but report to the same boss. The author is concerned about the professionalism and potential career impact. Also, he didn't have a say in the trip, which is a big deal. The girlfriend paid for everything, so he's worried about cancellation fees but still refuses to go. \n\nThe author's stance is that she should have asked him first. From a relationship standpoint, big decisions like this usually require mutual agreement. If she didn't consult him, that's a problem. But he's also being strict about not wanting to travel, even though she's already spent money. His friends think he's ungrateful, but maybe they're missing the point about consent and shared decision-making. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did decline a surprise that she put a lot of effort into. But the way she handled it was problematic. Maybe he's justified in feeling that she overstepped by using their boss without his input. However, his refusal might come off as unappreciative. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. But in terms of right and wrong, the author's points about needing to be consulted are valid. The girlfriend's approach was flawed. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
