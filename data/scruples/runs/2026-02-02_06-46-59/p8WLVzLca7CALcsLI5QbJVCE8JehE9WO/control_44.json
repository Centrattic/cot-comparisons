Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. The key points here are consent, prior communication, and professional implications.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland without the author's knowledge. She coordinated with their boss, who they both report to, without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't know about it, didn't agree to it, and is concerned about the professional implications of using leave in this way. \n\nThe author's main arguments are that the girlfriend should have asked him first, that using company time for an overseas trip might be unprofessional, and that he prefers to use his leave for relaxation at home. The girlfriend, however, sees this as a thoughtful surprise and is upset when he refuses. Friends are telling the author he's being ungrateful.\n\nFrom a consent standpoint, making a significant decision (using personal leave) without the other person's input is a problem. Even if the girlfriend intended it as a surprise, she should have discussed it with him first. The author has a valid point about the lack of communication. \n\nProfessionally, coordinating leave with their boss without the employee's knowledge could be risky. The author's concern about jeopardizing his career is valid. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially since they work under the same boss. \n\nThe fact that the author didn't express enthusiasm initially and then refused might come off as ungrateful, but his reasons are grounded in the lack of consent and potential professional risks. His friends' reactions are more about the gesture than the actual issue of consent. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's intentions were good, the method was flawed. The author isn't wrong for refusing because he wasn't consulted, and his concerns are legitimate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
