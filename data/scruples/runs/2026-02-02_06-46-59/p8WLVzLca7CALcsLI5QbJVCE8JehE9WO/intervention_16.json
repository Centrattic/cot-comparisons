Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't ask him first and involved their boss without his consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's main issues are that the girlfriend arranged leave without his input, which he feels is unprofessional and could affect his career. Also, he doesn't want to travel overseas and would prefer to relax at home. On the other hand, the girlfriend planned this surprise, probably thinking it would be a nice gesture for his birthday, and she's already spent money, so she's upset he's not happy.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. One point is that the girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a problem because it's his leave and his preferences. However, the boyfriend didn't express his preferences beforehand, maybe? Did he ever mention he doesn't want to travel? Also, the girlfriend used their boss, which might have been risky, but maybe she thought it was a good idea.\n\nNow, considering if the boyfriend is in the wrong for refusing. If he's not interested in the trip and didn't know about it until the surprise, is it wrong to decline? He did have a valid concern about professional implications. But maybe he could have been more appreciative. However, the fact that the trip was planned without his consent is a big factor. He's not obligated to go if it's against his wishes. But maybe he should have communicated his preferences earlier if he had any.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend's intention was good, but she overstepped by arranging things without his input. So the author's refusal is justified because the trip wasn't discussed with him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing by his own preferences and the surprise was done without mutual discussion. So answer B (No).\n"
