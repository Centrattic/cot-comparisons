Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go because she didn't ask him first and he's uncomfortable with using leave for travel. The author of the post is the one who refused, and friends are saying he's ungrateful. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend arranged a surprise vacation, paid for it, and told their boss in advance. The author is upset because she didn't consult him, he didn't apply for leave, and he prefers relaxing/sleeping instead of traveling. He felt she should have asked first. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent to use leave time, the surprise aspect, and the use of company resources. The girlfriend involved their boss, which could be seen as a breach of privacy or unprofessional. The author is concerned about professionalism and not wanting to use his leave for travel. But the girlfriend's intention was to give a surprise gift, which the author didn't appreciate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, the girlfriend did something nice, even if unilaterally. He might feel she overstepped by using their boss without consulting him. On the other, he didn't express his feelings until it was too late, leading to her being hurt. Also, he could have communicated his preference for staying home earlier. But he did mention he prefers relaxation over travel. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have been well-intended, but she didn't consider his preferences. The author's refusal could be seen as valid because he didn't agree to the use of his leave. However, the surprise aspect might not have been the best approach. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend made a decision for him without asking, which is an issue. The author is justified in feeling that his autonomy was disregarded. But he also didn't communicate his travel preferences beforehand. However, since she paid for everything, returning it might be necessary, but he's concerned about fees. \n\nThe key point is that the girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making arrangements. The author is right to point out that she didn't ask, which is a valid concern. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because his decision is based on his own preferences and the unprofessional handling of leave. The girlfriend's mistake was not consulting him first. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his own needs and the girlfriend overstepped by not seeking permission.\n"
