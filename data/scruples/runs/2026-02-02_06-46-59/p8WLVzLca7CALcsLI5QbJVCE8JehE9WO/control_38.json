Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation, paid for by her, and coordinated with their boss months in advance. The author is upset because they didn't get to choose whether they wanted to go on the trip, and they didn't want to take couple's leave because they think it's unprofessional and prefer to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did something nice, spending money and time to plan a surprise. She went to the effort of talking to their boss, which shows she wanted to make it special. However, the author is not happy because consent wasn't obtained. They feel that their preferences were ignored, and they're worried about professional implications.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask if the author wanted to go, which is a big deal. Even though she paid for everything, the author has the right to make decisions about their own time and how they spend their leave. The author's concern about unprofessionalism is valid if they're in a corporate environment where taking leave for a trip, especially with a partner, could be seen as inappropriate or could affect their career. The author also mentions preferring to relax by sleeping, which is a personal choice that the girlfriend didn't consider.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, and she might have thought the surprise would be a welcome treat. However, making assumptions about someone's preferences without asking is a common mistake in relationships. The author's friends think they're ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't negate the need for consent. Being given a gift without input can lead to resentment if it doesn't align with the recipient's wishes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't refuse the trip immediately but expressed their unwillingness after realizing the implications. They also considered the financial loss for the girlfriend, which shows they tried to be considerate. The main issue is that the girlfriend didn't ask, which is a breach of respecting the author's autonomy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons for not wanting to go, and the girlfriend should have checked with them first. The answer should be B (No).\n"
