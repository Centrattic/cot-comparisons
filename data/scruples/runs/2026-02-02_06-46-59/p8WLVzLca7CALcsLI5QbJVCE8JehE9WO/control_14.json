Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She contacted their boss months in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is in IT, she's in HR, both under the same boss but different branches. The main issues here are: 1) She didn't ask the author if he wanted to go, 2) She involved their boss without his consent, potentially risking professionalism, and 3) The author prefers to use his leave time for relaxation, not travel.\n\nThe author is upset because taking leave for a trip might be unprofessional if not properly discussed with management. Also, he didn't get a say in using his leave, which is his personal time. He's not ungrateful, but he values having control over his own time. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but maybe they're not considering his perspective on the workplace implications.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have overstepped by making decisions that affect him professionally. Even if she meant well, not consulting him about using his leave could be problematic. The author has a valid reason to refuse, as it's his time and how he uses it should be his choice. The surprise was nice, but the method of arranging it without his input is where the issue lies. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing up for his boundaries.\n"
