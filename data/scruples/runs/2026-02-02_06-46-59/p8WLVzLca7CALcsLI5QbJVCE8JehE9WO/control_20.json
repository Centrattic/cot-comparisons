Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and already cleared it with their boss. The author is upset because she didn't consult him first, and he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep. He refused to go, which made her annoyed. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, should the author be in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend went to a lot of effort and expense, and surprised him with a gift. She might have thought it was a thoughtful gesture, especially since they work in different branches and don't see each other much. The fact that she coordinated with their boss shows she tried to make it happen for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's main issue is that she didn't ask him first. He values his personal time and would rather use it to relax. He's concerned about professional implications, like using leave for travel without his consent. He also mentions that using company leave for such a trip might be unprofessional, especially since they report to the same boss. \n\nBut wait, the boss was already informed, so maybe the professional issue is already handled. The author's preference for not traveling is valid. However, the girlfriend's action might be seen as overstepping by making the decision without his input. Gifts should ideally be something the recipient wants, but in this case, it's a significant trip that affects his personal schedule. \n\nHe didn't express his preferences before she made the plans. If he had communicated his desire to use the leave differently, maybe she could have respected that. But he didn't, and now he's refusing. His friends see him as ungrateful, but he's standing by his preference. \n\nIs it wrong to refuse a gift? Not necessarily, but the way he's handling it might affect their relationship. However, the core issue is consent and communication. She made a big decision without his input, which is a problem. He's within his rights to decline, especially if the trip wasn't desired. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's asserting his personal preferences and the surprise was made without his agreement. The girlfriend should have asked first.\n"
