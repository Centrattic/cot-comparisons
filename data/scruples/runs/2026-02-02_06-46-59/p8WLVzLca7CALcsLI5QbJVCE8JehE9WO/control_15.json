Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author's girlfriend surprised him with a two-week trip to Switzerland for his birthday. She arranged it by talking to their boss months in advance without telling him. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he's concerned about the unprofessionalism of using company leave for a vacation, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. He also prefers to relax and sleep during his leave instead of traveling. He refused to go, and now his girlfriend is upset, while his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend paid for everything, including flights and ski resorts, which she didn't get to use. The author is upset that she didn't consult him before booking. He feels that using company leave for a trip without his input is a problem. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought the surprise was a thoughtful gesture.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From the author's perspective, he didn't agree to the trip, and his leave time is his personal time. The girlfriend didn't ask for his opinion, which is a valid concern. People have different preferences on how to spend their time, so the author's preference to relax instead of travel is his choice. However, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, which could be seen as a kind gesture, but she overstepped by not discussing it with him first.\n\nAlso, the fact that she informed their boss without the author's knowledge raises professional concerns. Using company leave in this way could indeed affect their careers, which the author is right to be concerned about. So, there's a professional element here that the girlfriend might have mishandled.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought the surprise was a great idea and didn't consider the author's preferences. The author's friends are telling him he's ungrateful, which might mean they don't see the issue with the girlfriend's approach. But the author's main issue is the lack of consultation and potential professional risks.\n\nIs the author wrong for refusing a trip that he didn't agree to? Probably not. He has the right to his own time and preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements, especially involving company leave. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by his decision. The girlfriend's actions were perhaps overzealous and inconsiderate of the author's wishes and professional boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
