Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, arranged with their mutual boss without consulting him. The author is upset because she used company leave without discussing it with him, which he feels is unprofessional and could affect his career. He also mentions he prefers to relax and sleep at home instead of traveling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did go to a lot of effort, paid for everything, and involved their boss. She might have thought she was doing something special. But the author has valid concerns about professional boundaries and not having a say in how his leave is used. Using company leave without consulting him could be problematic, especially if it's seen as using company time for personal reasons. Also, the author's preferences are clear\u2014he doesn't want to travel, so forcing him to go against his will might be disregarding his autonomy.\n\nThe friends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to agree with the action. The key issue here is whether the girlfriend overstepped by making decisions about his leave without his input. The author's main point is that she should have asked him first. That makes sense because leave is a personal matter and using company resources for personal trips without consultation can be a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but maybe she didn't consider his feelings about how the vacation was arranged or his preferences. The author isn't rejecting the gesture itself but the method and lack of communication. He's standing by his choice because he doesn't want to be unprofessional and he has his own preferences for using his time off. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? The question is whether refusing is inconsiderate. The girlfriend's actions were possibly unprofessional and disrespectful of his autonomy. The author's refusal is about his boundaries and career concerns. Therefore, he isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
