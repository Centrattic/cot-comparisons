Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and coordinated with their boss to get leave. The author didn't like the surprise because they weren't consulted first and they don't want to take an overseas trip. They ended up refusing to go, which made the girlfriend upset. Friends say the author is ungrateful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend did plan this surprise, which shows she wanted to do something nice for her partner. She used her position in HR to talk to their boss, which might have been a bit of a risk but maybe she thought it was okay. However, she didn't ask the author first, which is a key point. The author feels that their personal preference (not wanting to travel overseas) wasn't respected. They also mention that using company leave for this might be unprofessional, which adds another layer of concern about potential career risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't express their preferences before the surprise was planned. If they had communicated earlier that they didn't want to take an overseas trip, maybe the girlfriend wouldn't have proceeded. The fact that she went ahead without consulting him suggests a lack of communication. The author's friends think he's ungrateful, but the author's reasoning is that the decision should involve both of them, especially since it affects his work and personal preferences.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent and communication. The girlfriend intended to be generous, but didn't seek the author's input, which is important in a relationship. Decisions that affect one person's professional and personal time should ideally be mutual. The author's refusal isn't about being ungrateful but about the lack of mutual decision-making. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't ask first, and the author had valid concerns about work and personal preferences.\n"
