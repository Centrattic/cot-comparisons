Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The scenario involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, using their paid leave. She approached their mutual boss months in advance without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't want to take overseas time off, preferring to relax and sleep. Friends think he's being ungrateful, but he's annoyed because she didn't ask first and the arrangement could be unprofessional.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend put in effort and expense, maybe thinking it's a nice surprise. She might believe that since she handled the logistics, he should be happy. However, the author's main issue is that he wasn't consulted. He values his autonomy over his leave time, which is a valid point. Using company leave for a trip, especially without the employee's consent, could be unprofessional. Also, the surprise might not align with his preferences, which is understandable.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend overstepped by not consulting him, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's gesture was meant well and the author is being too ungrateful, then he might be at fault. But the key here is consent. The author didn't agree to the trip, and his boss was approached without his knowledge. That's a major red flag for him. The fact that he's in a different department adds complexity, but they share a boss. The author's career concerns about professionalism are valid. So, the girlfriend made a big decision without his input, which is a problem. The author is justified in refusing because he didn't agree to it. His friends' comments about being ungrateful might not consider his valid concerns. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
