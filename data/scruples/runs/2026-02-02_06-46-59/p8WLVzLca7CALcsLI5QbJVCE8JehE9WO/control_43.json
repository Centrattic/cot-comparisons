Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's girlfriend planned a surprise birthday trip to Switzerland, arranged with their mutual boss. The author is upset because the girlfriend didn't ask for his input and used company leave time, which he thinks is unprofessional. He also prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep. The girlfriend paid for everything, and now the author is refusing to go, leading to conflict. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The girlfriend did use her position in HR to coordinate with their boss, which might be a conflict of interest or unprofessional, depending on company policies. The author didn't get to choose, which is a problem because personal decisions about vacation time should be mutual. However, the trip was a surprise, which is a common gesture, but planning it without consulting him is a big oversight. The author's reasons for not wanting to go\u2014preferring relaxation over travel\u2014are valid. The girlfriend might have overstepped by not getting his consent, especially when using company leave. The author's friends think he's ungrateful, but the main issue is lack of communication. So, is he in the wrong for declining a surprise he wasn't consulted about? Probably not, because he's within his rights to refuse. The girlfriend's approach was flawed. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
