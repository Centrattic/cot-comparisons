Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland using their company's leave. She approached their mutual boss without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't agree to the leave and prefers to relax at home. He's worried about the professionalism of taking couples' leave and the potential career impact. His friends think he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked him first.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a significant decision without consulting him. Even though she paid for everything, using company leave, especially with a shared boss, might be risky. The author has valid concerns about professional repercussions and personal preferences. But the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, the main issue is that she didn't check with him. Surprise gifts are common, but when they involve such a major life decision as taking time off work, especially with potential professional consequences, it's important to have mutual agreement. The author's refusal isn't just about being ungrateful; it's about respecting his boundaries and choices. The girlfriend's approach might have been well-meaning, but it overlooked his input. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing his ground. He's asserting his right to make decisions about his own work and personal time. The answer should be B, No.\n"
