Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend, who works in HR, arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She talked to their mutual boss months ahead to secure the leave. The author is upset because he didn't know about it, and he's not into traveling overseas. He prefers to relax and sleep during his time off. He didn't like the surprise and said he would refuse to go because she didn't ask him first. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend intended a surprise, which she might have thought was a thoughtful and romantic gesture. She might have assumed he would be happy and didn't consider his preferences. On the other hand, the author feels that his autonomy in deciding how to use his personal time is important. He didn't get to say anything, and the arrangement could be unprofessional if they had to coordinate with their boss. Also, the cost is already sunk with non-refundable bookings, but he still prefers not to go.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to go, which is a big deal because personal time should be the individual's choice. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to travel, especially since he's not into it. The fact that she went to their boss without his knowledge adds another layer of unprofessionalism from his perspective. However, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, and the author's refusal might hurt her feelings, so maybe he could have approached it more sensitively.\n\nBut the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. The author's right to his personal time and preferences is important. If you plan a trip for someone without their input, especially involving work, it's a breach of trust and could be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend made a big decision without considering his wishes. So, in that sense, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own needs and boundaries. The friends saying he's ungrateful might not be considering that he didn't consent to the trip. So the answer would probably be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
