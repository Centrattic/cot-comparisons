Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation that his girlfriend paid for. The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, booked flights, and even talked to their boss in advance without telling him. The author is upset because she didn't consult him and he doesn't want to travel overseas on leave. He prefers to relax and sleep instead. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he believes she should've asked first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip without discussing it with him. She used their boss, which might be unprofessional, and he's worried about career implications. He's not happy with the surprise and refuses to go. The question is whether he's in the wrong for that.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he feels that major decisions affecting him should be discussed. He's not against the trip itself but the method of organizing it without his input. His main issue is lack of consent. He also mentions preferring to use his leave time for relaxation, which is his personal choice.\n\nThe girlfriend's intention was to be generous and surprise him, which is a common gesture. However, she didn't consider his preferences. The problem here is about consent and communication. In relationships, big decisions usually require mutual discussion. Even if the gesture is thoughtful, not consulting the partner can lead to issues.\n\nThe author is not ungrateful for the trip itself but for how it was handled. He's concerned about professional boundaries (boss knowing about personal leave) and his own personal time. His friends think he should go, but that's more about appreciating the gesture rather than the process.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings and setting a boundary. He's not refusing the trip because of the cost but because it was arranged without his input. The girlfriend may have overstepped by making decisions without him, especially regarding work-related matters. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His right to have a say in how his leave is used is valid. The girlfriend's actions, while well-meaning, may have been inconsiderate of his needs and boundaries.\n"
