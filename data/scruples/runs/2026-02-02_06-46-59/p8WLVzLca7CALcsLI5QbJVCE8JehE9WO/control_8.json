Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a vacation to Switzerland, but the guy is upset because she didn't ask him first and arranged it with their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip, booked flights, and told their boss. The guy is in IT, she's in HR, same company but different branches. The main issues here are: did she overstep by not consulting him, and was it unprofessional to involve their boss?\n\nThe guy's arguments are that using company leave for a trip without his input is unprofessional and he prefers to relax at home. The girlfriend might feel she did something nice and he's being ungrateful. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend didn't check with him about his preferences for vacation, which is a big deal. Even if it's a surprise, taking someone on a trip they didn't agree to can be a problem. Also, involving their boss without confirmation might be a red flag for him, especially if they work under the same boss. \n\nProfessionalism-wise, maybe she shouldn't have approached their boss without discussing it with him first. It could create issues if they needed time off for other reasons later. \n\nThe guy's friends say he's being ungrateful, but that's subjective. He has valid reasons for not wanting the trip. The girlfriend's intentions were good, but the execution lacked communication. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He had the right to be consulted about using his leave and the vacation plans. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
