Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She paid for everything, including flights and ski resorts. She went to their boss months ahead to get the leave, keeping it a secret. The author is upset because he didn't know about it beforehand and feels it's unprofessional to ask their boss for leave without discussing it with him first. Also, he prefers to relax and sleep during his time off instead of traveling. He told her he would refuse to go, leading to her being annoyed. His friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend made a big decision that affects the author's work and personal preferences. She didn't consult him, which is a problem because using vacation time is a personal choice. Even though she did the necessary steps (talking to the boss), the author's autonomy is important. He has the right to decide how he uses his leave. Her action might have been considerate in trying to plan a nice surprise, but the lack of communication is a major issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the trip was a surprise, which people often do to show affection. She might have thought he would be happy and didn't want to ruin the surprise by asking. But the problem is that she made a decision that impacts him without his input. Even if she paid for everything, the author's preferences matter. He's not obligated to go on a trip he doesn't want. \n\nThe friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude shouldn't override one's personal boundaries. The author has valid reasons: professional concerns about how the leave was arranged and personal preferences about how to spend time off. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether respecting his autonomy and communication is more important than the gesture of the surprise. Since the girlfriend didn't ask, even though her intentions were good, the author is justified in refusing. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's anything else. The fact that she went to the boss could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's a shared boss. The unprofessionalism he mentions might be her doing, not him. So, the author's refusal is a response to her actions, which might not be his fault. So, I think B is correct.\n"
