Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation with flights and accommodations, using leave time that was coordinated with their mutual boss. The author is upset because they weren't consulted beforehand and they don't want to go on the trip. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend did something nice but maybe overstepped by not asking first. The author feels that using company leave for a vacation, especially without their knowledge, is unprofessional and against their preferences. The girlfriend went ahead without consulting him, which is a problem. The author's friends think they're being ungrateful, but the user is wondering if they're actually wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend wanted to do something nice but didn't consider the author's preferences. The author's main objection is that they weren't asked and that the arrangement involved their boss, which could have professional repercussions. The girlfriend's actions, while enthusiastic, may have been presumptuous. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for not wanting to go on a trip they didn't agree to. The girlfriend should have discussed the plans with him before making the arrangements. The fact that she already paid for everything complicates things, but it doesn't negate the author's right to refuse. The key here is that mutual respect and communication are important in relationships. The girlfriend's surprise should have included checking if he was okay with the plans. \n\nThe user's friends say he's being ungrateful, but the author's reasoning is valid. He has legitimate concerns about professionalism and personal preference. The girlfriend's actions, while intended to be kind, lack the necessary communication. So, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
