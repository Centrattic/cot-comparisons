Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend arranging a trip to Switzerland without consulting him, using their company's leave policies, which he found unprofessional.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip without asking him. He didn't like the idea of using work leave for travel, especially since they report to the same boss. He felt it was unprofessional and didn't want to go. She had already paid for everything, including cancellation risks. He told her he's unhappy and refuses to go, leading to her being annoyed. Friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, planning a surprise trip without discussing it could be seen as a breach of communication. However, there's also the professional aspect. Using work leave for a vacation without the employee's consent might be problematic, especially if it affects their jobs. The author's objection isn't just about not wanting to travel but about the method used to arrange the leave. \n\nThe girlfriend intended a nice surprise, but the execution had potential professional risks. The author's refusal is based on valid concerns about work and personal preference. On the other hand, not showing enthusiasm might hurt her feelings, but the core issue is about respecting his boundaries and prior communication. \n\nThe author isn't being ungrateful if his main issue is the lack of consultation and the professional implications. His friends' opinion that he's ungrateful might overlook the fact that he didn't want to go in the first place. The key here is whether the author's refusal is justified given the circumstances. Since he had legitimate concerns about work and wasn't consulted, it's reasonable for him to refuse. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
