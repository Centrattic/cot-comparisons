Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation using their company's leave, but she didn't consult the author. She informed their boss ahead of time without the author's consent. The author is upset because they didn't ask him, and he prefers to use his leave time to relax at home. He's refusing to go, hence the AITA question.\n\nFirst, consider the girlfriend's actions. She paid for everything, including flights and resorts, and went to their mutual boss without the author's knowledge. This could be seen as overstepping because she made decisions about his leave time without consulting him. Using company leave for personal travel might be a sensitive issue, especially if their boss is involved, which could affect their professional relationship. Also, he might be worried about how this looks to their boss, potentially impacting his career.\n\nThen there's the author's perspective. He didn't appreciate the surprise because he wasn't asked. He prefers to use his time off differently. The girlfriend's lack of communication is a key point here. Even though she had good intentions, planning a trip without his input could be seen as dismissive of his preferences.\n\nThe friends said he's being ungrateful. But gratitude aside, the main issue is that she didn't check with him. He has a right to decide how to use his leave time. So, he's not wrong to feel that his autonomy was ignored. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making any plans.\n\nOn the other hand, she did go to the trouble of planning it and might have spent a lot of money. He's concerned about cancellation fees, which is understandable. However, the root problem is the lack of communication. The author's refusal isn't about the money but about the principle of being excluded from the decision.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have been more appreciative and suggested alternatives, but the girlfriend should have talked to him first. Since she didn't, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. He's standing up for his personal preferences and the importance of mutual decision-making in the relationship.\n"
