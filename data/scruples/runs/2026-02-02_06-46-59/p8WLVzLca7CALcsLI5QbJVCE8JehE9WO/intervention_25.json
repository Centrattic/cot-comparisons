Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a vacation to Switzerland, paid for by her, and he's refusing to go.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend worked in HR, so maybe she knows how to handle things professionally. She arranged the trip with their boss in advance, which the boyfriend found out about when he received the tickets. The main points here are: she didn't ask him if he wanted to go, she used company resources (talking to their boss) without his input, and he feels it's unprofessional and he prefers to use his leave to relax at home.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that using company leave for a trip is unprofessional and could affect his career. Also, he didn't want to go on an overseas trip. The girlfriend probably thought she was doing something nice, but didn't consider his preferences first. The friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have consulted him.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, both communication and respect for boundaries are important. The girlfriend planned a surprise, which can be sweet, but overriding his preferences without discussion might be where she went wrong. However, the boyfriend could have expressed his concerns earlier instead of waiting until after the trip was booked. \n\nThe boyfriend's refusal might come off as ungrateful because the trip was already paid for. On the other hand, the girlfriend shouldn't have made such a big decision without his input, especially involving work. The key here is whether consulting him was necessary. Since he clearly states he doesn't want to travel, she should have asked. But he didn't ask her to cancel, so maybe he's in the wrong by not appreciating her gesture. \n\nHmm, but the trip affects his career. Using company leave for a vacation might not be the best idea, especially if it's for a couples' trip. The girlfriend's approach was unprofessional, so the boyfriend is justified in being upset. However, his response of refusing might be seen as harsh. \n\nI think the main issue is the girlfriend's lack of communication. If she had asked him first, maybe the situation would be different. But he didn't stop her from planning it. Now that it's done, refusing could be seen as unappreciative. But his reasons are valid. It's a tough call. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were the main issue, but maybe he's not handling it well. Wait, he didn't say thanks, he just refused. That might make him the AITA. But his reasons are professional and personal preferences. Hmm. Maybe they both have some fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend definitely made a mistake, but the author's refusal could be seen as ungrateful. So maybe he's in the wrong (A) because he didn't appreciate her gesture and didn't communicate his preferences earlier. Or maybe he's not because she should have asked first (B). I think the answer depends on whether the surprise was appropriate. Since she used work resources and didn't check with him, he's justified in refusing. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
