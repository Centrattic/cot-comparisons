Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for his birthday, paid for it, and told their mutual boss in advance. The author didn't like the surprise because they didn't ask him and using the leave for an overseas trip might be unprofessional. He refused to go, and now they're both upset.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she planned a surprise without consulting him. Surprises can be nice, but in this case, it involved using company leave and possibly affecting their work. The author's concerns are about professionalism and personal preference. He didn't want to go on an overseas trip and would prefer to relax at home. He didn't like that she didn't ask first, especially since the vacation is expensive and non-refundable.\n\nThe girlfriend might see this as a thoughtful gesture for his birthday, but the author feels that she overstepped by not discussing it with him. The key points here are consent and communication. Even if the girlfriend intended to make him happy, not discussing such a significant plan that affects both their work and personal time is a problem. The author has a right to his own preferences, especially regarding his leave and how he wants to spend it.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend probably wanted to do something special for his birthday, which is a common gesture. But the fact that she didn't check with him beforehand is the main issue. The author is justified in feeling that his autonomy was disregarded, especially since the trip affects his work schedule and he has different plans for his leave. The friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the fact that the problem is about consent and mutual decision-making, not just about being thankful.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? He didn't act as enthusiastically as she wanted, which could be hurtful, but his refusal is based on valid concerns. The girlfriend's main mistake was not seeking his input. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing, as he has legitimate reasons related to work and personal preference. The real issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
