Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, which she arranged without his consent. She talked to their boss months in advance, which the author finds unprofessional. He's upset because he didn't agree to use his leave for an overseas trip and would prefer to relax at home. The key points here are consent, communication, and the potential professional implications.\n\nThe girlfriend did spend money and made plans, but the author feels she shouldn't have done it without his input. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is unsure. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's gesture was a surprise, which can be a nice way to show affection. She went to the effort of coordinating with the boss and booking everything. The friends think the author is ungrateful. But on the other hand, the author has valid concerns about professional boundaries. Asking their shared boss for couples' leave could indeed be seen as unprofessional, especially if they work in different departments. Also, using personal leave for a trip without discussing it with the partner is a major decision that affects both their careers and personal preferences.\n\nThe author's main issue is that his preferences weren't considered. He wanted to use his leave to relax and sleep, which is a legitimate desire. The girlfriend's action, while thoughtful, bypassed his autonomy in making such a significant decision. Even though the tickets are already paid, the author's right to control his own time and career decisions is important. The fact that he brought up the refusal because she didn't ask first shows he values mutual decision-making in important matters.\n\nThe girlfriend's annoyance might stem from feeling her gesture was rejected, but the author's stance is about respecting boundaries and communication. So, in this context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing by his decision, as he's asserting his right to be consulted on a major life decision that affects him. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
