Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. Initially, they had a good sex life, but after engagement, it went down a lot. The fianc\u00e9 tried to respect the partner's reasons, like body image issues, but later found out the partner wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic upbringing and guilt. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially and now feels the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage when they started dating. The partner changed her stance after engagement, which is causing conflict. The author feels wronged because their expectations weren't met. On the other hand, the partner has valid reasons tied to her religious beliefs and personal feelings of guilt. She might have been struggling with these feelings even before the engagement but only realized or felt comfortable expressing them later.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual expectations. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage, so the author's expectations were based on that. However, the partner's change in stance after engagement could be due to her own personal growth or reassessing her values. It's possible that she didn't realize her feelings until after the engagement, which is a new development.\n\nBut the author is now upset because this change affects their relationship. The problem here is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The author is within their rights to feel frustrated if the sexual dynamic has changed significantly without prior agreement. However, the partner has her reasons rooted in personal beliefs. It's a mutual issue where communication is key. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the partner's reasons and instead focused on their own expectations. Alternatively, if the partner changed her stance without discussing it beforehand, that could be part of the problem.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. The author respected initial reasons (body image) but later found out the real reason was related to religious beliefs. The partner might not have been entirely honest earlier, which could contribute to the author's resentment. However, the author could also have addressed the issue sooner instead of waiting for resentment to build. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's feelings are valid, but expecting the partner to maintain the same level of sexual activity without acknowledging her personal struggles might be unreasonable. However, the partner's change in stance after engagement isn't necessarily something the author should have anticipated. The situation is complex, and both parties might share some responsibility. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If the author is resentful because their expectations weren't met, that's a personal reaction, but whether they're in the wrong depends on if they acted inconsiderately. The author hasn't done anything morally wrong; they're expressing their feelings, which is acceptable. However, the partner's decision, while causing conflict, is also a personal choice based on her beliefs. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but perhaps they could have communicated better. However, the initial answer hinges on whether the author is the asshole. Given that the author didn't agree to wait from the start and the partner changed her mind, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the author is resentful without considering the partner's reasons, maybe they are. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer might be B (No, author not in the wrong) because they are expressing their feelings about a change in the relationship dynamic they didn't agree to. However, if the author is not considering the partner's valid reasons, perhaps they are. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just having a valid complaint. Since neither party is necessarily at fault, but the author's frustration is a reaction to a change they didn't consent to, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The partner's decision is personal, but the author's reaction is about unmet expectations. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
