Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is engaged and is upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly since they got engaged. They had a good sex life before engagement but now it's only twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later admitted she wants to wait until after marriage because of her Catholic background and feelings of guilt. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now their dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on premarital sex after the engagement. The author is feeling wronged because they didn't agree to that arrangement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are tied to her religious background and personal guilt. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, communication is key. The author says they had conversations about the change in sex drive, and the fianc\u00e9e eventually opened up about her reasons. The author respected her initial explanations but was upset when the real reason was revealed. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the fianc\u00e9e decided to wait until marriage, which wasn't part of their original agreement. The author is now resentful because their expectations weren't met. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her personal beliefs and upbringing. \n\nIs it fair for the author to be upset? Well, if both parties entered the relationship without the expectation of waiting until marriage, then the fianc\u00e9e changing her mind later might come as a surprise. However, people can change their minds based on new circumstances or reflections. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons seem genuine and tied to her values, which she's now choosing to honor. \n\nThe author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations. But is that the fianc\u00e9e's fault? If the author didn't want to wait until marriage and the fianc\u00e9e decided she wants to, that's a difference in their needs. The author is now in a position where they might need to adjust their expectations, possibly leading to more discussions about their relationship's future if this is a deal-breaker. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The fianc\u00e9e isn't necessarily wrong for changing her stance, especially if it's based on her conscience and values. However, the author isn't wrong for being upset if this was a significant factor in their relationship. But the question is whether the author is \"the asshole.\" \n\nThe author is expressing frustration and resentment, which is understandable but might indicate a need for further communication and resolution. If the author can't accept this change, maybe the relationship needs to be reevaluated. However, the fianc\u00e9e isn't being deceitful; she's being honest after initial hesitation. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be no because the author's feelings are valid. However, there's a component of the author needing to address their own expectations and willingness to meet in the middle. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are legitimate, so the author isn't entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (they are not in the wrong).\n"
