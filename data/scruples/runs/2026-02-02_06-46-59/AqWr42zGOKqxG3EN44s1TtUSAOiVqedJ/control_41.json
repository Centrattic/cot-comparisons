Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, but she's lost interest since they got engaged. She mentions body image issues and later reveals she's religious and wants to wait until marriage. The author feels upset and is starting to resent her for the change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author hasn't done anything wrong, right? They're in a committed engagement, expecting the relationship to continue as before. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on premarital sex, possibly due to her Catholic upbringing and guilt before the wedding. The author didn't agree to that boundary when they started dating; it came up later. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her values, but the author is now facing a significant change in their sexual relationship. They're not pressuring her to have sex before marriage, just expressing frustration because her decision affects their current dynamic. The author isn't violating any boundaries; they're upset that their fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without prior agreement. \n\nHowever, I should check if the author is overstepping. Did they respect her initial reasons for the decreased sex drive? The post says they respected her body image concerns and didn't press her. That's good. Then when her reasoning changed, they confronted her respectfully. The author's issue is the sudden change in expectations, not her choice itself. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling resentful? Maybe not, since communication is key in relationships. But the fianc\u00e9e might be wrong for changing the terms without discussing it beforehand. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, so this new boundary wasn't mutual. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is allowed to grow and change her views. However, she should have communicated this earlier. The author's frustration is valid because their expectations for the engagement period didn't include abstinence. The problem arises from the lack of prior agreement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e made a unilateral decision that affects both of them, leading to the author's resentment. They're not violating any rules; they're reacting to a change in the relationship's terms without prior discussion. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
