Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is engaged and feels upset because his fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. She mentioned she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again, citing religious upbringing and guilt. The author feels betrayed because they didn't agree to that when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because the dynamic changed after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are about personal beliefs and family background. She had body issues initially, but later admitted to religious guilt. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, and the change is causing resentment.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after they were already in a committed relationship. If they had discussed this before engagement, maybe they could have found a mutual understanding. The author's feelings of resentment are valid because expectations were not aligned. However, the author also respected her initial reasons about body image and didn't push further, which shows consideration. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait now might be a personal choice, but it affects their relationship. \n\nBut the key point is that the author didn't agree to this change. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden shift in behavior without prior agreement could be seen as a breach of the initial agreement they had when starting the relationship. The author has the right to feel upset if the terms of their relationship have changed without mutual consent. However, the author should also consider the fianc\u00e9e's reasons, especially her religious convictions. But since they didn't agree to this when they started dating, the author isn't entirely wrong to feel this way. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be the asshole because they tried to understand her body issues and waited, but now the change is affecting their expectations. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her personal choice, but the author has the right to express their feelings. The problem is the lack of prior agreement. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't at fault for being upset when the relationship's dynamics changed without mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e made a unilateral decision, so the author isn't wrong to feel resentful.\n"
