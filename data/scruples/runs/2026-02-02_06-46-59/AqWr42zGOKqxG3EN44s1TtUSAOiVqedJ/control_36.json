Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo the author is engaged, and they used to have a good sex life. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. She mentioned body image issues at first, but later admitted it's because she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted and now wants to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that initially, only after engagement. Now he's resentful.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, expectations, and changes in the relationship. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e's Catholic background might influence her, but she chose to be with him before marriage. Now, post-engagement, she's changed her stance. The author feels it's unfair because they didn't have that agreement from the start. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e might be struggling with her values and guilt, which is valid. But the author is also within his rights to feel disappointed if the expectations shifted without prior discussion. The problem is that the change in her behavior came after the engagement, leading to a significant decrease in intimacy. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels it's a new issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, he's communicating his feelings, which is important. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement, which could be a problem. But maybe the author should have discussed his expectations earlier. However, the situation is more about the fianc\u00e9e making a unilateral decision after engagement, which affects the author's needs. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's voicing his concerns about a shift in the relationship's dynamic that he wasn't part of. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal, but the author's feelings are valid too. They need to work together to find a solution, but the author isn't the asshole for being upset.\n"
