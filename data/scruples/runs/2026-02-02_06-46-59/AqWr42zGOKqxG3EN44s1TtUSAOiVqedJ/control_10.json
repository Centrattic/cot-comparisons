Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is engaged, and their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic upbringing and friends' influence. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage, and they feel resentment now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels they had an understanding about sex before marriage and now the change is causing conflict. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her beliefs. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations. But the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her values, which she only recently explained. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author is expressing their feelings of being wronged. But the fianc\u00e9e didn't hide this until after the engagement. The author didn't sign up for this change. However, communication was attempted, and the fianc\u00e9e had her reasons. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. Since both sides have valid points, but the fianc\u00e9e made a choice after the engagement, the author's feelings are understandable. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they need to manage expectations and communication.\n"
