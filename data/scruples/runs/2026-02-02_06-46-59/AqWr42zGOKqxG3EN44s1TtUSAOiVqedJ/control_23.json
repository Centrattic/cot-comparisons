Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e after she decided to wait until marriage. \n\nFirst, the couple was already engaged and had a good sex life before engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. The author tried to talk about it, and she initially blamed body image issues. Later, she revealed she's feeling guilty about not losing her virginity the \"right way\" and wants to wait until marriage. Both didn't choose to wait when they started dating, but now she's changed her stance because of her Catholic background and friends.\n\nThe author feels upset and resentful because this was a change post-engagement. The key points here are consent, communication, and expectations. When they started dating, neither intended to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait now might be a personal choice influenced by her background and current feelings. The author didn't agree to this when they got engaged, so expecting her to continue having sex as before might not be fair if she's changed her mind.\n\nBut the author also respected her initial reasons (body image) and only confronted after a long time. The fianc\u00e9e has the right to her own boundaries, even if they change. However, the author has a right to feel upset if this change affects their relationship. It's a mutual issue requiring discussion. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling this way, but the fianc\u00e9e's choice to set new boundaries is valid. The problem might be more about how they're handling it rather than who is objectively in the wrong. Since the author didn't agree to the new terms and is now resentful, maybe they aren't the asshole, but the situation is complex. However, the author is in a position where they need to address this with their fianc\u00e9e, not just blame her. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but it's nuanced.\n"
