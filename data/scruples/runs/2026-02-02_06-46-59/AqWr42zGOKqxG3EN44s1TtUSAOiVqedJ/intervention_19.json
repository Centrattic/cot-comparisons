Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is engaged and has been for a year, with the wedding coming up. The sex life dropped from three times a week to twice in a year after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she was holding out until marriage because of her Catholic upbringing and her past with her previous boyfriend. The author is upset, feels resented, and is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which is a significant shift. The author's frustration is about unmet expectations and the sudden change in their relationship dynamic.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religious background and personal experiences. She came clean after some discussion, so communication was attempted. However, the author feels betrayed because the agreement wasn't mutual from the start. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nI should consider if the author is overstepping by being resentful. Maybe the fianc\u00e9e made a valid effort to communicate, but the author's reaction is about unspoken expectations. Alternatively, is the author justified in feeling let down because the terms of their relationship changed without prior agreement?\n\nAlso, the author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but later found out it was about waiting until marriage. So, the problem is the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. Did the author not address this earlier? They did try to have conversations, but it took time for her to open up.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. The fianc\u00e9e could have been more upfront earlier, and the author could have expressed their needs more clearly. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's resentment might be valid if the expectations weren't aligned. However, respecting her reasons is part of the engagement. But since the author didn't agree to wait from the start, the shift is causing conflict.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault because the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance after engagement is a new variable that affects the author's expectations. However, the author's approach of confronting and prying could be seen as aggressive. But the main issue is the unmet expectations. The answer might hinge on whether the author is justified in feeling resentful due to unspoken changes in the relationship terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e altered her behavior after the engagement, which wasn't discussed upfront. However, the author could have addressed this before engagement to avoid conflict. Since the engagement is a mutual commitment, the author's frustration is understandable. But is it the author's fault for not considering this possibility earlier? I'm leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the change in the fianc\u00e9e's stance is a new issue post-engagement, which wasn't part of their initial agreement. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
