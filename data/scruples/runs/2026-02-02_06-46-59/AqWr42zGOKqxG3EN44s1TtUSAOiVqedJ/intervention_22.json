Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, citing Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until after marriage. The author feels upset and resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was already having sex before engagement, so the change happened after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9 gives reasons related to her upbringing and guilt, while the author feels it's a recent development and is upset about the lack of sex. \n\nThe author's main argument is that he didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating. Now that they're engaged, the fianc\u00e9 wants to wait, leading to a conflict. The author is upset and developing resentment. \n\nI should think about mutual respect and communication. The fianc\u00e9 did talk about body issues first, then later revealed her religious reasons. The author respected her initial concerns but now feels it's a shift. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling upset. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to be on the same page regarding expectations. Since the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance post-engagement, maybe without discussing it earlier, the author could feel misled. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and rooted in her beliefs. The author's resentment might be understandable if he feels his needs aren't being met, but it's also important to respect her boundaries. \n\nBut the problem is that the author is upset because the dynamic changed after engagement, which might indicate he didn't consider that her feelings could evolve as the wedding approaches. If they discussed it and she made her stance clear, then the author has to deal with it. However, if she didn't communicate this earlier or if he feels it's a betrayal of their original agreement, he might be justified. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable for not accepting her decision. If he's upset because it's affecting him emotionally and physically, but she's being honest, maybe he's not at fault. Alternatively, if he didn't address his concerns and is now resentful, maybe he's at fault for not communicating his needs. However, since she changed her stance after engagement, perhaps he's within his rights to feel upset. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 clearly stated her reasons and he still feels upset, it's up to both to find a solution. However, the author might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her decision, even if it's a recent change. But since the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and she's honest, maybe the author is not in the wrong. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. But given that the author tried to communicate and the fianc\u00e9 was upfront, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, he did mention not being okay with the change post-engagement, so maybe there's a communication issue. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is expressing his feelings, which are valid, and the fianc\u00e9's change came after the engagement. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the author should have accepted her decision, then A. But given the situation, B might be more accurate.\n"
