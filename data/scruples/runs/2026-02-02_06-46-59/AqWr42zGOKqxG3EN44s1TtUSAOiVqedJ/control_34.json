Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is engaged to their fianc\u00e9e, and they've noticed a significant drop in their sex life after getting engaged. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she's feeling guilty because of her Catholic upbringing and wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and they're now resentful about the change in dynamics.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual expectations. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance came after the engagement. The author feels it's unfair because they didn't sign up for that, and it's affecting their relationship now. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e made a choice after the engagement to change their sexual dynamics. The author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasons are based on her religious beliefs and personal feelings. She might be struggling with guilt as the wedding approaches. The author, on the other hand, feels that this change is unexpected and not discussed upfront. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. It seems like they had conversations about the sex drive issue, but the root cause (wanting to wait) was revealed later. The author is upset because the terms of their relationship have changed after the engagement, which wasn't part of the initial agreement. \n\nWhether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they have a right to feel upset about this change. Since they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her own, but it's affecting the author's expectations. \n\nHowever, the author is not wrong for feeling upset if the change wasn't discussed earlier. But is the author in the wrong for being upset? Or is the fianc\u00e9e in the wrong for changing the terms without prior agreement? \n\nSince the question is about the author's wrongdoing, if the author is simply expressing their feelings and is not being unreasonable (like pressuring or being disrespectful), then they aren't the asshole. The fianc\u00e9e might be in the wrong for not communicating this earlier, but the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
