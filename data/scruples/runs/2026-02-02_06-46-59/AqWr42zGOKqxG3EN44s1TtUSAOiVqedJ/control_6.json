Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e changing her stance on having sex after they got engaged. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The engaged couple is getting married soon. They had a good sex life before engagement, but after the engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. She initially attributed it to body image issues but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic background and friends' influence. She didn't wait for her previous boyfriend, but now she's feeling guilty approaching the wedding.\n\nThe author is upset because they didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating. Now, after engagement, this change has caused a shift in their relationship dynamics, leading to resentment. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual agreement when they started dating (they both had sex before marriage), a change in the fianc\u00e9e's stance post-engagement, and the author's resulting feelings of resentment. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual consent are crucial. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the engagement, which wasn't part of the original understanding. However, the author should have discussed this earlier if it was a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons (religious background, guilt) might be valid for her, but the author is now feeling wronged because the terms have changed. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset since the expectations changed. The fianc\u00e9e made the decision after the engagement, not from the start. But the author might have been complicit in not addressing it sooner. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasoning could be genuine, so the author's resentment might be understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement, and the author is reacting to a shift in their relationship terms. However, it's important that both parties communicate their needs and boundaries. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about the change.\n"
