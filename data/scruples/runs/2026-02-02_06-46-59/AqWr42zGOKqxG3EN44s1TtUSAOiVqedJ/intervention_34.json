Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels upset because their fianc\u00e9 changed their stance on sex. They were having regular sex before engagement, but after, it's drastically less. The fianc\u00e9 cites body image issues and religious guilt about waiting until marriage. \n\nThe author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially. Now, with the wedding approaching, the fianc\u00e9 wants to wait, which is causing tension. The author is upset and starting to resent their partner. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they respected the fianc\u00e9's initial reasons (body issues) and gave her space. But when confronted, the fianc\u00e9 admitted to a deeper religious reason. The author didn't expect this change post-engagement. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both partners have the right to express their needs and boundaries. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision to wait until marriage was something that came up later, even though their initial agreement wasn't based on that. The author's frustration stems from unmet expectations. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage. If the fianc\u00e9's reasons are genuine and she's standing by them, the author needs to respect that. However, if there was a mutual understanding beforehand that they wouldn't wait, then the fianc\u00e9's change in stance could be problematic. \n\nThe key here is whether there was a prior agreement about premarital sex. The user mentioned that neither of them chose to wait when they started dating, but the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind after engagement. The author didn't expect this shift, leading to resentment. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to have open dialogue. The author's upset might be valid if there was an assumption of continuing the previous dynamic. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and rooted in her beliefs. \n\nMaybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but they need to address it constructively. The fianc\u00e9's change in stance without prior discussion could be seen as a shift in expectations that affects the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind without prior discussion, the author's frustration is understandable. But since the author didn't press the issue initially, maybe they should have discussed it earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision post-engagement is a new development. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to feel upset about a significant change in their relationship's dynamic without prior agreement. However, the situation requires mutual understanding and communication. The author's resentment might be valid given the circumstances.\n"
