Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being upset that his fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly after they got engaged, and for feeling resentful because she now wants to wait until after marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were dating before the engagement and had a regular sex life. After engagement, her interest decreased, and she now cites religious guilt and a desire to wait. The author is frustrated because he didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and he's feeling resentful now. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, if they both were okay with having sex before marriage and didn't agree on waiting until engagement, then changing the terms later without prior agreement could be an issue. The key here is communication and mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which might not be fair if the author wasn't on board. However, her reasons\u2014religious guilt, wanting to preserve something for marriage\u2014are personal and might be valid to her. \n\nBut the author is feeling upset and resentful. That's a natural reaction if expectations were set and then changed. The question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't forcing her to change; he's expressing his feelings. If they had an open conversation and she made her decision known, maybe the author should have considered that. However, since the change came after the engagement and without prior discussion, the author might feel blindsided. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's feelings are reasonable. It's common for people to adjust their expectations in a relationship as it progresses. If the fianc\u00e9e decided to wait after engagement, that's her choice, but it's important that both partners are on the same page. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset if this change affects their relationship dynamic. So the answer is B, No.\n"
