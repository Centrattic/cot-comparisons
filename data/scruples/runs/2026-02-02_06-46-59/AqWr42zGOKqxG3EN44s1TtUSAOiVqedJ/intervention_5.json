Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e significantly reducing their sexual activity after engagement, leading to the author feeling upset and developing resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The couple had a good sex life before engagement but it dropped after. The fianc\u00e9e attributes this to body image issues, but later reveals it's about wanting to wait until after marriage due to Catholic upbringing and friends' influences. They both didn't choose to wait initially, but she's now changing her stance.\n\nThe author feels wronged because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. Now, with the wedding approaching, the fianc\u00e9e's change in desire is causing conflict. The author respects the choice but is upset because it wasn't discussed earlier. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the fianc\u00e9e changed her expectations post-engagement, leading to a shift in their relationship dynamics. The key points here are communication, mutual expectations, and the change in behavior after a significant commitment (engagement).\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and tied to her religious background, which might influence her feelings of guilt. However, the author argues that they never agreed to wait, so this sudden shift is causing distress. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset about this change.\n\nConsidering consent and mutual agreement in relationships, it's important that both partners are on the same page regarding expectations. If the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion, it could lead to misunderstandings. However, the author also chose to respect her initial reasons without pressing too hard, which might have delayed addressing the issue.\n\nThe author's resentment stems from unmet expectations and a lack of prior communication about post-marriage sexual activity. However, the fianc\u00e9e is acting based on her personal values and may be struggling with her own guilt, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nIt's possible that both parties have valid points. The author's frustration is understandable if they felt the decision was unilateral, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in her personal beliefs. The core issue is communication and alignment of expectations after the engagement. \n\nIn deciding whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their feelings of resentment are justified. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion and the author's expectations weren't met, it's a mutual issue. However, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset about a change in their partner's behavior that affects their relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's actions might not be malicious, but the lack of communication is a problem. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. The author's main argument is that they didn't agree to wait until marriage, so the fianc\u00e9e's decision after engagement is causing conflict. The author is entitled to feeling upset if their expectations weren't met. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have addressed the issue earlier, but the fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate the potential change until later. The answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for resenting a change in the relationship that wasn't mutually agreed upon. Given that the author's expectations were not met and there was a lack of prior discussion, the author might not be in the wrong. Therefore, answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
