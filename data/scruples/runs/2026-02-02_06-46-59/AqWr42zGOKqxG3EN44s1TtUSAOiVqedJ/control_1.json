Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly wanting to stop having sex after they got engaged, citing religious reasons and guilt. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now they're getting married soon, and their sex life has drastically decreased. They feel resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement but now is avoiding it. She gives reasons like body image and religious guilt. The author is upset because they didn't discuss this before and now it's affecting their relationship. The author is asking if they're the asshole for being upset and resentful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about communication and mutual expectations. When they got engaged, maybe they should have discussed their expectations about intimacy after marriage. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons (religious guilt, body image) are valid personal issues. The author might feel wronged because the change happened after engagement, which is a time when planning a future together is crucial. But the fianc\u00e9e's feelings are also important. The author's resentment might make them seem inconsiderate if they didn't try to understand her perspective. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset if the fianc\u00e9e didn't address this earlier. But if the author is now resentful without trying to find a middle ground, maybe that's an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their resentment is justified or if they should have been more understanding from the start.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because they had a different expectation and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion. But they also need to consider her feelings. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid, even if the author is upset, it's a complex situation. But the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to be upset if their partner's change affects their relationship without prior discussion. However, if the author is being resentful without trying to resolve it, that's a problem. But the question is if they're in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author's feelings are understandable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior without prior agreement could lead to the author feeling wronged. So B.\n"
