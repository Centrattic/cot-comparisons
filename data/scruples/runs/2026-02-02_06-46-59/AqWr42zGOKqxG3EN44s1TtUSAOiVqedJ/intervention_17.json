Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in sex drive after engagement, which the fianc\u00e9e attributes to her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset about the change in their dynamic and starting to resent her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that before engagement, they had a good sex life. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. The fianc\u00e9e gives reasons related to her religion and past experiences. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now it's causing tension. \n\nI should think about expectations in a relationship. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage. Now, after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is introducing this new dynamic. The author feels that this was a change not discussed upfront, leading to resentment. But the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religious beliefs and personal feelings about her past. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, if the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement without prior discussion, that could be an issue. However, the author did try to respect her reasons initially but felt ignored as the issue persisted. The author's resentment is because of a lack of communication or agreement on this matter. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and tied to her beliefs. The author might have a right to feel upset if this was a significant change affecting their intimacy. But maybe the author should have addressed this earlier or both parties should have had more open discussions about their expectations post-engagement. \n\nAlternatively, if the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her personal beliefs and communicated them eventually, maybe the author is overreacting. But the fact that the author didn't agree to this when they started dating and now it's causing a problem could mean they are in the right to express their feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are expressing their feelings about a change in the relationship that wasn't discussed upfront. They tried to respect her reasons but the situation isn't resolved, leading to valid frustration.\n"
