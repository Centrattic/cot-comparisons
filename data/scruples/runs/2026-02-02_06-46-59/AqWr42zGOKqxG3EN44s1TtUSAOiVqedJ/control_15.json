Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about their fianc\u00e9e decreasing her sex drive after engagement due to Catholic guilt and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that arrangement from the start and now feel resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author and fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement but it dropped significantly afterwards. The fianc\u00e9e gives reasons related to her religious background and body image. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage, and their expectations changed. \n\nSo, the key points are: communication, respect for boundaries, and mutual expectations. The author respected her initial reasons about body issues but then found out it was about waiting until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which the author didn't consent to. \n\nIs the author wrong? They're upset because their needs aren't being met now. But the fianc\u00e9e is also making a choice based on her beliefs. However, the timing is an issue\u2014she didn't bring this up until after engagement, which was a mutual commitment. The author might feel it's unfair that her stance changed post-engagement. \n\nBut maybe the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her own needs and beliefs. The author should have discussed this earlier. However, since the engagement is a significant commitment, changing terms now might feel like a betrayal. The author's resentment is valid if they didn't agree to this change. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and deserve respect. \n\nBut if they didn't discuss it before engagement, maybe the author is right to feel wronged. The fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her desire to wait until marriage before engagement. Now, the author is being asked to adjust again. So, the answer might hinge on whether the fianc\u00e9e's decision is within her rights, even if it's causing conflict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the right because the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the engagement, leading to frustration. But if the fianc\u00e9e is acting on genuine feelings and beliefs, the author should respect that, even if it's inconvenient. However, the author's needs are also valid. \n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset because the fianc\u00e9e's decision affects their relationship. But the fianc\u00e9e is also not wrong in her personal choice. However, since the author didn't agree to this change, the fianc\u00e9e might be overstepping by altering the terms of their relationship post-engagement without prior discussion. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't the asshole because they're expressing their feelings about a significant change that impacts them. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal, but they should have discussed this before engagement. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
