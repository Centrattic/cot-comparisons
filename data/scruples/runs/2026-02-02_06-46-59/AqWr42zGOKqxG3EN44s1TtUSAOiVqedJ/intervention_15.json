Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding both perspectives.\n\nThe author is engaged and upset because his fianc\u00e9e has significantly reduced their sexual activity since engagement. Initially, they had a good sex life, three times a week. After engagement, it dropped to twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues like weight gain and psoriasis. The author respected that but feels frustrated. Later, she reveals that she's waiting until marriage to have sex because of her Catholic upbringing and guilt about not losing her virginity the way she wanted with a previous partner. The author is upset because he didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now he's resentful.\n\nThe key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which came as a surprise to the author. He feels that the dynamic has shifted without prior agreement. The author is frustrated because he didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, and the reduction in intimacy is affecting him. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is dealing with personal beliefs and insecurities, which is valid, but she waited until after engagement to bring this up.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) and didn't push. When confronted, she shared her new rationale. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her personal values and mental health. The author's frustration is understandable, but he should have discussed his expectations about sex before engagement, not just after. However, the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance without prior communication is a problem. \n\nIt's a complex situation. The author isn't entirely wrong for feeling upset, but perhaps he could have addressed his needs sooner. The fianc\u00e9e's communication delay is a significant issue. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since both partners have valid points but the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance led to the conflict, the answer might hinge on whether the author's expectations were communicated clearly. If the author didn't discuss his needs initially, he might share some responsibility. However, the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change without prior discussion is also problematic. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's frustration is valid, but his resentment could be seen as a reaction to her not communicating her needs earlier. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is influenced by her values, which should be respected, but the timing of her revelation affects the author. Ultimately, both need to communicate better and adjust expectations. However, since the question is about the author being in the wrong, if the author's actions were reasonable given the information he had, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he should have addressed his own expectations earlier, then he might be. The key is whether he's in the wrong for being upset. I think both are at fault, but the question is binary. The options are A or B. Given that the fianc\u00e9e made a change without prior discussion, and the author is reacting to that, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author should have discussed his needs earlier, then maybe he is. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance is a new factor, and the author's reaction is understandable. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the author is upset because his needs aren't met, which is valid, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal. It's a conflict of needs and values. The question is about being the asshole. The author is frustrated, which is a normal reaction, but the fianc\u00e9e's timing is poor. The answer might be B because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset; the issue is mutual. But the question is whether he's the asshole. If he's just expressing his feelings, then no. However, if he's being unreasonable, then yes. The answer might be B.\n"
