Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict. The author is upset because their partner now wants to wait until marriage, even though they both had sex before engagement. The author is feeling resentful and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage. Now, post-engagement, the fianc\u00e9 is changing her stance due to her religious background and guilt. The author feels it's unfair since they didn't agree to this beforehand. The key points are communication, mutual expectations, and changes in circumstances.\n\nThe author respected the fianc\u00e9's initial reasons (body image) and gave her space, but the real reason came up later. The fianc\u00e9's change in desire is due to her personal beliefs and upcoming marriage. The author is conflicted because they're used to a different dynamic. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If they're upset because expectations weren't discussed early on, maybe they shouldn't have assumed the same level of intimacy post-engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance without prior discussion, which could be the issue. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but if the fianc\u00e9 communicated her reasons after the fact, maybe the author needs to adjust. \n\nBut the question is about who is in the wrong. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. Now, with the wedding approaching, the fianc\u00e9 is changing the terms. The author's feelings are valid, but they might be expecting a different dynamic than what was agreed upon. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and rooted in her background. If the author didn't consent to this change, they have a right to feel wronged. \n\nAlternatively, if the author knew about her Catholic background and potential guilt, they might have been aware of possible changes. But the fianc\u00e9 didn't communicate this until after engagement. The author's resentment could be justified if they weren't consulted. \n\nIn terms of AITA, if the author is the one being unfair for not respecting her decision, then A. If the fianc\u00e9 changed terms without discussion, then B. The answer hinges on whether the author is at fault for their expectations versus the fianc\u00e9's valid change in stance. I think the author is not in the wrong because the expectations were not aligned from the start, and the fianc\u00e9 is changing her mind without prior agreement. So answer B.\n"
