Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped significantly after getting engaged. The partner blames Catholic guilt and wanting to wait until marriage, even though they didn't choose that route when they started dating. The author is upset and feels resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. Now, after engagement, the partner wants to change the terms. That could be a problem because expectations might not have been aligned from the beginning. The author is feeling wronged because they didn't sign up for abstinence post-engagement. \n\nBut then, the partner has her reasons rooted in religion and personal guilt. Maybe she's going through a phase of reconciling her past with her current beliefs. The author respected her initial reasons about body issues, which shows understanding. However, the sudden shift in their dynamic after a year of engagement might not have been communicated clearly. Did the author have any prior discussions about expectations pre-engagement? If not, then the partner changing her mind later might not be entirely her fault. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. If the couple didn't discuss their views on sex and abstinence before getting engaged, then both might be at fault. The author's resentment is understandable, but it's also important for them to have had these conversations earlier. The partner's change in perspective could be genuine, but the author now has to deal with the consequences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if they didn't set clear boundaries or expectations about their sexual relationship before marriage, then they might share some responsibility. However, the partner changing her stance after a year of engagement without prior discussion could also be an issue. The question is whether the author is justified in their frustration. I think both parties need to communicate better, but the author's resentment stems from unmet expectations. However, the partner's decision, while inconvenient, isn't necessarily a betrayal if they communicate it. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but the situation is more about miscommunication than one person being the asshole. \n\nAlternatively, if the author had no idea this was coming and the partner didn't discuss it before engagement, then the author's upset makes sense. But if the author didn't ask about her views on premarital sex, then they also share responsibility. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the partner changed her stance after an engagement that didn't include that agreement. The author has a right to feel upset if their expectations were unmet. However, the author should have had that conversation earlier. But since they didn't, maybe the partner is also at fault. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe not. I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because the partner changed the terms of their relationship after the engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author's resentment is justified if the expectations weren't aligned. The partner should have communicated her need to wait until marriage before getting engaged. So the author isn't the asshole.\n"
