Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped significantly after engagement, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that before engagement, they had a good sex life, but after engagement, it went down to twice a year. They confronted their fianc\u00e9e, who explained it's due to her Catholic background and feeling guilty, wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that initially and now feel their dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nNow, looking at the key points: The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal\u2014religious guilt and wanting to align with her friends' experiences. She didn't communicate this until after engagement. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but then felt blindsided by the new explanation. The author is upset because they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, which wasn't part of their original agreement when they started dating. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nI should consider consent and communication. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which wasn't part of the initial understanding. The author had a right to expect a certain level of intimacy, and the sudden change affected their relationship. However, the author respected her initial reasons and tried to be patient. But the fianc\u00e9e's new reasoning (religious guilt) wasn't communicated earlier, leading to a significant shift in their relationship dynamic. The author's resentment is understandable if they felt they agreed to a certain level of intimacy when they got engaged, but now that's not happening. \n\nBut maybe the author's resentment stems from not being on the same page regarding expectations. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait might be her personal choice, and the author might need to accept that, even if it upsets them. However, the author's feelings are valid because the change was unexpected and unaddressed until later. The fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her feelings about waiting from the start, especially since it's a significant change in their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the wrong if they expected a certain level of sexual activity without considering her reasons. But since the change happened after engagement and the author had already tried to be understanding, maybe the fianc\u00e9e is also at fault for not being honest earlier. \n\nIn AITA posts, the key is often whether both parties acted with consideration. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels let down. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior communication. The author's resentment is a result of unmet expectations, which might make them not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author didn't communicate their own needs and just expected things to stay the same, they might share some blame. However, the situation is more about the fianc\u00e9e's sudden shift in priorities, which the author didn't anticipate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's upset is understandable. They didn't agree to waiting until marriage, and the change in their partner's behavior is affecting their relationship. The author's resentment is a response to a change they didn't consent to. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a nuance here because the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons, but she didn't communicate them before engagement. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to expect a certain level of intimacy based on their prior relationship, and the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance after engagement, without prior discussion, is the main issue. The author's feelings of resentment are valid because the expectations changed without mutual agreement.\n"
