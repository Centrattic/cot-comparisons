Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged, and now the author is upset because they think the fianc\u00e9 suddenly wants to wait until marriage, even though they didn't choose that route when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9 cites religious guilt and body image issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The engagement period is a time when expectations can shift. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance on premarital sex after the engagement, which wasn't discussed before. The author is upset because their dynamic has changed, leading to resentment. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is the asshole. In AITA scenarios, we look at both parties' perspectives. The author is expressing frustration over the sudden change and feeling deprived. However, the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons, including religious beliefs and body image issues. The author respected her initial reasons but is now upset because the underlying issue was different. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, the author didn't agree to a post-engagement change in expectations. They had a good sex life before engagement, and the change caused tension. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid for her, but the author's feelings of being let down are also understandable. \n\nBut the author is not respecting the fianc\u00e9's boundaries now. The fianc\u00e9 is making a choice based on her beliefs, even if it wasn't part of the original understanding. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but that doesn't make them right. Both are in a difficult spot. \n\nIn AITA terms, the author's frustration is valid, but the fianc\u00e9's decision is her right. The author might not be in the wrong, but they should communicate better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is upset about a change that the fianc\u00e9 is making on her own terms, maybe the author isn't the asshole. The answer might be B (No). But maybe the author is in the wrong for not accepting the fianc\u00e9's decision, but the fianc\u00e9's change after engagement complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, if the author didn't agree to this change, but the fianc\u00e9 is making the choice, then the author is not in the wrong for being upset. It's a mutual issue, but the question is about the author's fault. The answer might be B.\n"
