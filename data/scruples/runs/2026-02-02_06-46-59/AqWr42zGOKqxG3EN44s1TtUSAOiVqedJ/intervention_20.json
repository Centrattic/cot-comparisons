Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e changing her stance on their sexual relationship after they got engaged.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The couple was engaged for a year and getting married in a few months. Their sex life was active before engagement but dropped significantly afterward. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she didn't lose her virginity in her previous relationship as she wanted and now wants to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand and are developing resentment.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, and the change in their fianc\u00e9e's behavior came after engagement. They respect waiting until marriage in general but feel misled because the decision wasn't made upfront. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a religious background, which might influence her feelings of guilt.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, communication is key in relationships. The fianc\u00e9e did explain her reasons, though it took some prying. The author respected her initial reasons (body image) but later realized there was another factor. The author might feel that the change in expectations after engagement is unfair, especially if their expectations were different. However, the fianc\u00e9e is being honest now, even if it's late. The author is upset because their expectations weren't aligned, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't necessarily being deceitful; she just didn't realize the impact of her past experiences until later.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the right to feel frustrated if the engagement was supposed to be a commitment to a certain level of intimacy, and the change is affecting their relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her values and past experiences. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but it's also important to consider mutual respect and understanding in a relationship.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for being upset. If the fianc\u00e9e's decision is a genuine change based on her values, and the author didn't agree to this, then both have valid points. However, the author is in the wrong if they didn't communicate their needs or expectations about their sex life before marriage. But the scenario suggests they had conversations, and the fianc\u00e9e was upfront eventually. The author's resentment might be understandable, but the fianc\u00e9e's actions aren't necessarily deceitful. So, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because their feelings are valid, but the fianc\u00e9e's honesty is also important. However, the question is about who is the \"asshole.\" If both are acting in good faith but with differing expectations, maybe neither is entirely at fault. But according to the options, the answer has to be A or B. Since the author is upset about a change in expectations after engagement, and the fianc\u00e9e was honest once confronted, perhaps the author is not the asshole. So, B.\n"
