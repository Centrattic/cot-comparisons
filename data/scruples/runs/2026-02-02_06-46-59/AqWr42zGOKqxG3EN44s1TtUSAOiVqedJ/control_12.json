Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. So the scenario is that the author's fianc\u00e9e has significantly reduced their sex life after getting engaged. The fianc\u00e9e gives reasons like body image issues, but later admits it's because she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex. The author is upset and feels resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't expect the fianc\u00e9e to wait until marriage, and they were already sexually active. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which might have been unexpected. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels wronged. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasons include personal beliefs tied to her upbringing and religion. She might be struggling with guilt as the wedding approaches. But did she communicate this clearly? The author mentions they had conversations, but she didn't disclose the real reason until after some prying. Maybe she should have been more open earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because their expectations changed. They might have assumed their sex life would continue as before. The fianc\u00e9e's decision, while respectful, is causing conflict. The author's resentment is understandable if their needs aren't being met. But is the author wrong for feeling this way? It's a matter of communication and mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement, which isn't common but not unheard of. The author's frustration could stem from unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her beliefs now. \n\nI think the key points are communication and mutual understanding. If the fianc\u00e9e hadn't communicated her reasons earlier, maybe she's partly at fault. But the author's reaction might also be extreme. Both need to talk and find a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is upset about a valid aspect of their relationship that was changed after commitment, perhaps they're not wrong. But if the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are legitimate and she communicated them eventually, the author might be overreacting. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because their feelings are valid, but maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. Wait, the options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not). Given the context, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to be upset about a significant change in their relationship dynamic. But I need to make sure. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her choice, but the author's feelings matter too. It's a mutual issue. However, since the question is about whether the author is the asshole, considering the details, the answer might be B. They're not wrong for being upset; the fianc\u00e9e should have communicated better, but the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
