  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple was engaged for a year, getting married soon. Before engagement, their sex life was good (3 times a week), but after engagement, it dropped to twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e attributed it to body image issues (weight gain, psoriasis) and then later mentioned wanting to wait until after marriage due to her Catholic upbringing and guilt. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and they're resentful now.\n\nSo, the author is frustrated that his fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is upset because expectations changed. They didn't agree on waiting until marriage initially. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait now affects their relationship dynamic. The author's resentment is understandable because they felt this change came suddenly. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religious background and personal feelings, which might be valid. She tried to communicate body issues first, then the deeper reason later. The author respected her initial reasons but is now upset when the real issue is revealed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had the opportunity to discuss these expectations before engagement. Maybe they should have addressed it earlier. The fianc\u00e9e coming from a Catholic background might have had those values all along but didn't mention them before engagement. The author might feel blindsided, but if he didn't bring up the topic earlier, he might be partially at fault. However, the fianc\u00e9e also didn't communicate her true feelings until later, which complicates things.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual expectations. The author didn't press the issue when she first mentioned body issues, which could be seen as respectful. But the change in sexual frequency is affecting him, and he's now upset. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and religious, which are important to her. However, changing expectations post-engagement without prior discussion could contribute to the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The author could have addressed the issue sooner if it was a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9e might have been more transparent about her religious feelings earlier. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his reaction is reasonable. His resentment is a natural response to unmet expectations, but he didn't agree to wait until marriage. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, expecting the same level of intimacy without addressing it in the engagement period might be his oversight. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the question asks for A or B, the user says the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9e made a significant change post-engagement that affects their relationship, and the author's feelings are valid. However, others might argue A because he should have discussed it earlier. Hmm.\n"
