Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e, who comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, now wants to wait until after marriage to have sex, which wasn't part of their original agreement. They didn't sign up for it when they started dating, but after engagement, she changed her stance. The author is feeling resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The fianc\u00e9e had reasons like body image issues initially, but later it turned out to be about waiting until marriage. The author respects waiting, but it wasn't part of their original plan. They had a good sex life before engagement but now it's twice in a year. The author is upset because their needs aren't being met.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to respect her reasons initially. Then when it became an issue, they confronted her. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement. The author is expressing their feelings of resentment. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author is expressing their feelings about a change in their relationship dynamic. Since they had conversations and she was honest, maybe the author's resentment is valid. But the question is if they're in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs are important. If the fianc\u00e9e is making a significant change post-engagement, the author has a right to be upset if it's affecting their well-being. However, the author also agreed to the engagement, which implies marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's religious background might influence her, so the author needs to consider her perspective. But the author isn't wrong to feel frustrated. They had expectations based on the past. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are expressing their feelings about a change in their partner's behavior that affects them negatively. The issue here is communication and mutual understanding, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. They tried to respect her reasons but the change is significant and recent.\n"
