Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly losing interest in sex after they got engaged, leading to tension and resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple was having sex three times a week before engagement but now only twice in the past year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she's Catholic and feels guilty about not waiting until marriage. The author is upset because they both didn't choose to wait when they started dating, so he feels she's changing the rules now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the factors. The author respected her initial reasons and didn't push. When the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, he confronted her. He wants to have sex but she's changed her mind, leading to a conflict. The author is feeling resentful, which he admits. \n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in behavior and her reasons come into play. She comes from a religious background, which influences her feelings. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage, so when she does, he's upset. However, she did communicate that she felt guilty, which is her own decision. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, he had the expectation of continuing their previous sexual relationship, which she's not fulfilling. But he also respected her initial reasons. The problem is that she changed her mind after they were engaged. The author might feel that since they didn't agree on waiting, her change in stance is unfair. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and based on her values and upbringing. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners need to meet halfway. The author's resentment is understandable if he felt the expectation was mutual. But he did try to understand her reasons initially. The issue arises when she changed her mind without prior discussion, leading to a shift in their dynamic. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's resentful because she changed the terms without discussing it more, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, he needs to consider her feelings and reasons. The question is whether his feelings of resentment and wanting to have sex are valid. Since they were both on the same page initially, her change might catch him off guard, but it's her right to change her stance based on her beliefs. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but he could be if he's not respecting her decision. However, the situation is nuanced. The answer depends on whether he's acknowledging her reasons and trying to find a middle ground instead of just resenting her. Since the author is seeking validation, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his feelings are valid given the circumstances, but he needs to navigate it with understanding.\n"
