Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped significantly after engagement, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that before engagement, they had a good sex life. After engagement, it plummeted. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body issues, then later revealed she wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic background and personal feelings of guilt. The author is upset, feels wronged, and is starting to resent her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance on premarital sex after engagement, which the author didn't agree upon when they started dating. The author is now upset because their expectations didn't align. \n\nI need to consider consent and mutual agreement in relationships. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage. Now that they're engaged, she's decided to change her approach, which affects their relationship. The author is feeling resentful because this decision was made after the commitment of engagement. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, it's a relationship where both parties should have mutual understanding. If the fianc\u00e9 made a change in her views without prior discussion, that could be a problem. However, the author also needs to consider her reasons\u2014religious background and personal guilt. \n\nBut the author didn't agree to this when they started the relationship. It's possible that the fianc\u00e9 is now imposing a new condition that wasn't part of their original agreement. The author is within their rights to feel that this change is affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have her own reasons and values. However, the author is in a position where their expectations are not being met, leading to resentment. It's about communication and whether the change was communicated properly. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault for being upset. The issue is more about the fianc\u00e9 changing her stance without prior agreement. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't agree to this new condition, their frustration is understandable. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be upset if their fianc\u00e9's change in behavior is unilaterally affecting their relationship. However, it's important that they communicate and possibly negotiate, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nHmm. Considering that relationships require mutual consent and that the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind without prior discussion, the author isn't wrong to be upset. So the answer would be B.\n"
