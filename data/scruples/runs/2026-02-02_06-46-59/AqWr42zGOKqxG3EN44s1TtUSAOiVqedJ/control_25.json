Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, but she's lost interest since the engagement, citing body issues and Catholic guilt. The author is upset because she didn't mention this before engagement and now the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her upbringing and religious beliefs. She might feel pressured by her family's expectations or her own moral convictions. The author respects her reasons but is upset because their expectations didn't align at the start of the relationship. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The fianc\u00e9e didn't disclose this before the engagement, which the author feels is a problem. However, it's possible she was struggling with these feelings even then but only realized or felt comfortable discussing it after the engagement. \n\nThe author is frustrated because their needs aren't being met, which is understandable. But expecting a sudden shift in sexual expectations after engagement without prior discussion could be seen as a fair concern. However, respecting her reasons and the context of her background is important. \n\nIn relationships, changes in intimacy can arise for various reasons. The author's resentment might stem from unmet needs, but the fianc\u00e9e's actions are based on her internal conflict. The question is whether the author is wrong to feel this way. \n\nConsidering that the author is trying to understand and has tried to respect her reasons, but the change is causing strain, it's a complex situation. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision isn't inherently wrong; she has her reasons. The author is in a tough spot, but the situation isn't entirely their fault. They need to communicate more and possibly seek counseling. \n\nBut the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. The answer likely depends on whether the author's reaction is justified. Since they were upfront about their expectations and are now dealing with a change, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, the fianc\u00e9e's responsibility to communicate her feelings sooner is also a factor. \n\nIn AITA terms, the author isn't the asshole for being upset about a shift in expectations, especially if they were not discussed beforehand. So the answer is B.\n"
