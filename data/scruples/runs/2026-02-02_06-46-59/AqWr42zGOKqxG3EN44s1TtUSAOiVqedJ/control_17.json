Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after the engagement, and the author is upset because they feel this was a sudden change in their dynamic. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple was engaged for a year, getting married soon. Before engagement, they had a good sex life. After, it plummeted. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues, but later revealed she's feeling guilty about not losing her virginity the \"right way\" and wants to wait until marriage. She comes from a Catholic background, which influences her feelings.\n\nThe author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially. They feel the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change is causing resentment. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, so expecting a change in sexual activity without prior agreement could be a point. However, the fianc\u00e9e did communicate her feelings once she was ready. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) before confronting her. But the fianc\u00e9e's new reason is about personal beliefs and religious upbringing, which she's now acting on.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but if the fianc\u00e9e made a genuine effort to communicate, maybe the author needs to adjust. However, if there was no prior discussion about changing expectations after engagement, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset. It's a mutual negotiation. But since the fianc\u00e9e raised the issue after the fact, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset as they didn't agree to the change. So maybe answer B (No).\n"
