Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly losing interest in sex after they got engaged, leading to conflict. The author is upset because they expected a certain dynamic in their relationship, which has changed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that before engagement, their sex life was good, but after engagement, it dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e initially attributed it to body image issues but later revealed she's feeling guilty about not waiting until marriage due to her religious upbringing. She comes from a deeply Catholic background where her friends waited until marriage, and now she's feeling conflicted because they didn't follow that path initially.\n\nThe author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which disrupted their relationship dynamics. The author is now resentful because their expectations aren't being met. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, both partners should have open communication about their expectations. The fianc\u00e9e changing her stance post-engagement could be seen as a legitimate personal choice, especially influenced by her religious values. However, the author is upset because their needs and expectations have changed. \n\nBut wait, did the author address the communication aspect? They did confront her and found out the reasons. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior is rooted in her personal values resurfacing as the wedding approaches. The author's frustration is valid because they didn't anticipate this shift. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also honest about her feelings now, which is important for mutual understanding.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? The key here is whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9e's choice. The author says they can respect waiting until marriage, but they didn't agree to it initially. The issue is that the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the engagement, leading to a significant shift in their relationship. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9e is also being honest now. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to negotiate and adjust. However, the author's resentment and the sudden change in the fianc\u00e9e's behavior are causing conflict. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Since the author is expressing their feelings and needs, which is healthy, but the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance is causing strain. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9e's current choice. If the author is pressuring her or not considering her feelings, that would make them wrong. But the post shows that the author tried to understand her reasons and is now conflicted. The author's resentment might be justified if the fianc\u00e9e's change is causing ongoing distress without compromise. However, expecting a partner to change their stance without discussion could also be an issue. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset. They've communicated, and the issue is about differing expectations and the fianc\u00e9e's evolving values. The answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings and seeking resolution.\n"
