Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped significantly after engagement, and the author feels upset about it. The fianc\u00e9 cites religious guilt and wanting to wait until marriage, even though they didn't choose that route when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a good sex life before engagement but it's decreased after. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body issues but later revealed she's feeling guilty due to her Catholic background and wants to wait until after marriage. The author feels they didn't sign up for this change in dynamic and is developing resentment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants opinions. \n\nI should analyze both sides. The author's perspective: they might feel that the sudden change post-engagement is unexpected and not discussed upfront. They might have expected the sex life to continue as before. The fianc\u00e9's perspective: she's struggling with her religious values and feelings of guilt, leading her to change her behavior. She might be going through internal conflict and trying to reconcile her past with her new commitment.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, communication is key in relationships. The fianc\u00e9 did eventually explain her reasons, though it took some prying. The author respected her initial explanations about body issues but now feels the change is significant. However, the author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, so the sudden shift might be a problem. But is the author at fault for not discussing boundaries about post-engagement expectations? Or is the fianc\u00e9 at fault for changing her stance without prior discussion?\n\nIn relationships, expectations can evolve. The fianc\u00e9's decision to wait could be a personal choice influenced by her background, even if it wasn't discussed before engagement. The author has the right to feel affected by this change, but the fianc\u00e9's autonomy in her decisions is also important. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable in their expectations versus the fianc\u00e9 being honest about her feelings.\n\nThe author's resentment might stem from unmet needs, which is a valid concern. However, the fianc\u00e9 is also making a choice based on her values. The answer might depend on whether the author is respecting her autonomy despite the impact on him. If the author is being resentful without trying to find a middle ground or understanding her perspective, he might be in the wrong. But if he's communicating his feelings and seeking a solution, it's a two-way issue.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 changed her behavior after the engagement, which could affect the relationship dynamics. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they didn't expect this change. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and related to her values. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but the fianc\u00e9's decision is her own. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid, and the fianc\u00e9's sudden change might be the main issue. However, the author could also be in the right to expect more communication before the engagement. Alternatively, if the author didn't address the issue sooner, he might share some responsibility. It's a bit of a grey area, but given the information, the author's resentment is a reaction to a significant change, so maybe he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
