Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about their fianc\u00e9e's sudden decrease in sex drive after engagement, which the fianc\u00e9e attributes to her Catholic background and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement beforehand and now feel resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on premarital sex after the engagement. They had a good sex life before, but now it's drastically less. The author feels they didn't sign up for this, leading to resentment. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religion and personal values, which she only recently felt comfortable sharing. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force the situation and gave her space initially. When confronted, the fianc\u00e9e was honest about her feelings and background. The author's frustration comes from unmet expectations and a shift in their relationship dynamic. However, the fianc\u00e9e isn't violating any agreement they both made; she's changed her perspective. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The author is justified in feeling upset, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. Neither is entirely at fault, but since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because the author is expressing valid concerns about a change in their relationship that affects them both. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her right, but the author's feelings are also legitimate.\n"
