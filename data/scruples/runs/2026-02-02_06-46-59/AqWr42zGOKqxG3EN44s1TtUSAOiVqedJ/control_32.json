Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e reducing their sexual activity after engagement, citing reasons like body image and Catholic guilt, which didn't exist before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels upset because the sex drive decreased significantly after engagement, leading to resentment. They mention respecting initial reasons like body issues but later found out about religious and personal guilt. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after they got engaged, which wasn't discussed before. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in her upbringing and personal beliefs. She comes from a deeply Catholic background, and her friends waited until marriage. Even though they both didn't choose that path initially, she's now conflicted as the wedding approaches. It's possible she's dealing with internal conflict between her upbringing and her current relationship.\n\nThe key points are communication and expectations. The author didn't know about her religious reservations until after engagement. They did communicate, but maybe not enough. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured by her beliefs now, which is a valid emotional struggle. However, the author feels wronged because the change in behavior is recent and unexpected, leading to resentment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing their feelings of being upset and resented, which is natural in such a situation. However, they should also consider that her reasons might be genuine. But since the change happened post-engagement without prior discussion, the author's frustration is understandable. They might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but they could have handled it better by addressing it sooner. However, the question is whether they are \"the asshole.\" Since both sides have valid points, it's a gray area. But the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset about a significant change in their relationship dynamic.\n"
