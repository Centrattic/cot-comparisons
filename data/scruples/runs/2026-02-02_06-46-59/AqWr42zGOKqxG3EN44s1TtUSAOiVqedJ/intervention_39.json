Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. He thinks it's because she's religious and Catholic, and she wants to wait until after marriage. He's upset because they didn't agree to that beforehand and now he's resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9 had a good sex life before engagement but it went down after. She mentions body image issues and religious guilt. The author is frustrated because he didn't agree to wait until marriage. He respects her choice but is upset because he feels this change came after they got engaged. \n\nHe confronted her, and she admitted feeling guilty due to her background and friends. Now he's resentful. The question is whether he's the asshole. \n\nI should think about communication. They had conversations about it, and she didn't mention the religious reasons at first. He waited until he felt it was serious to confront her. Maybe he had a right to be upset because the dynamic changed without prior agreement. But on the other hand, she's dealing with personal issues and changed her stance after engagement. \n\nIs he in the wrong for being upset? Well, it's natural to feel frustrated if a significant change affects the relationship. But he should consider her feelings and reasons. The key points are mutual respect and communication. Did he handle it appropriately? He respected her reasons initially but now is resentful. Maybe he should work on understanding her perspective rather than focusing on his own feelings of being wronged. \n\nBut the fact that she changed her stance post-engagement without prior discussion might be a valid concern. However, people can have changing perspectives. The author's resentment is a problem, but is it his fault? It's a complex situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe both have valid points. But the question is if he's the asshole. Since he's respecting her reasons but still feels resentful, perhaps he's not in the wrong. Or maybe he is because he needs to address the resentment in a healthier way. Alternatively, maybe she's the one in the wrong for changing things without discussing it upfront. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A or B. Considering that he's respecting her reasons but is upset because of the change post-engagement, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer could be B. However, if he should have been more understanding, then A. \n\nBut the main issue is that he's upset because there was no prior agreement. Both made choices when they started dating not to wait. Now she's changing her mind. It's about consent and mutual agreement. If he's okay with waiting, then he's not in the wrong. If he's not okay, but she's changed her stance, it's a conflict. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's respecting her choice but is frustrated, maybe he's not. So answer B.\n"
