  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly losing interest in sex after they got engaged, and now she's explaining that she wants to wait until after marriage due to her Catholic background and some guilt. The author is upset and feeling resentful because they didn't agree to this beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The engaged couple was having sex regularly before the engagement, but after the engagement, the sex drive dropped. The fianc\u00e9e gives reasons related to her religious background and a past experience with her previous boyfriend. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage and feels the dynamic has changed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on premarital sex after they got engaged. They had sex before being engaged, and now she wants to wait. The author is arguing that they didn't agree to that, so they're feeling betrayed or resentful. \n\nFrom one perspective, people can change their views over time. The fianc\u00e9e might have realized she wants to wait, which is her personal choice. However, the author might feel that this change is affecting their relationship negatively, leading to a lack of intimacy. But is the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, it's important to consider communication and mutual expectations. The fianc\u00e9e did come forward with her reasons, so maybe the author is frustrated because they didn't get their needs met. However, respecting each other's boundaries is key. The author might be in the right to express their feelings, but expecting their fianc\u00e9e to conform to their previous expectations without compromise could be where the issue lies. \n\nWait, but the author is asking if they're the asshole for being upset. The fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons related to her religion and personal feelings. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, but the fianc\u00e9e is now choosing that path. The author's resentment comes from the change in expectation. It's a conflict of values. The author's perspective is that they didn't agree to this, so they feel wronged. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also acting on her own beliefs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the author had discussed their expectations about sex before marriage, maybe the situation could have been addressed. But the fianc\u00e9e is now making a choice that the author didn't anticipate, leading to conflict. The author's frustration is understandable, but they need to consider their partner's feelings. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author is pressuring the fianc\u00e9e to have sex despite her wishes, that would be problematic. But the author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful, not necessarily pressuring her. \n\nSo, maybe the answer depends on whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9e's choice while also addressing their own needs. If the author is being inconsiderate or not communicating effectively, they might share some blame. But if they're trying to express their feelings and seeking a solution, they might not be in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e made a choice that affects the relationship, so perhaps both sides have points. However, since the author is the one feeling wronged and the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her beliefs, the author's upset is a reaction to unmet expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, it's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they might need to work on communication and compromise rather than resentment. The fianc\u00e9e's choice is valid, but the author's feelings are also legitimate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is expressing their feelings and hasn't forced the issue, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B.\n"
