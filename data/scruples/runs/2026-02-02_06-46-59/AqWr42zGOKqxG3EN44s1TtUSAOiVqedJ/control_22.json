Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about their fianc\u00e9e wanting to wait until marriage for sex. \n\nFirst, the couple got engaged a year ago and are getting married soon. Their sex life dropped from three times a week to twice a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted to feeling guilty due to her Catholic background and wanting to wait until marriage, even though they both didn't choose that path when they started dating.\n\nThe author is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement beforehand. They're feeling resentful because the change happened after the engagement. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual agreements. \n\nWhen they started dating, neither expected to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to change this now, especially as the wedding approaches, might be causing the conflict. The author's frustration is understandable because they didn't consent to this change earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings of guilt from her religious background are also valid. \n\nBut since the agreement to wait was a recent development and wasn't part of their original understanding, the author's resentment isn't entirely unfounded. The fianc\u00e9e had the right to reassess her feelings, but it's important that they both discuss and agree on these matters. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset because they were unaware of this change in expectations until after the engagement. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
