  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in sexual desire after engagement, attributed to religious guilt and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage and feel resented.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9 is coming from a deeply religious background and has body image issues. She changed her stance after engagement, which the author didn't expect. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels wronged because the dynamic changed. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. When they started dating, neither intended to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9's decision to wait came after engagement, possibly influenced by her Catholic upbringing and upcoming wedding. The author is upset because their expectations were different, leading to resentment.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author's frustration is understandable, but they also had to respect her changing feelings. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and rooted in her beliefs and self-image. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but they need to consider her perspective. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified or if they should have anticipated this possibility when they got engaged. Since they both agreed to marry, maybe the author should adjust their expectations. But if they didn't agree to abstinence beforehand, then the author's feelings are valid. It's a complex situation where both might have valid points, but the author's resentment could be seen as a lack of understanding, making them partially at fault. However, given the fianc\u00e9's new stance post-engagement, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. Still, the answer depends on whether the author should have foreseen this or if the fianc\u00e9's change is unreasonable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's decision came after engagement, and the author's expectations were different. But I'm not sure. Another angle: if the author knew her background, maybe they should have discussed expectations earlier. But since the change happened after engagement, maybe the author isn't wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
