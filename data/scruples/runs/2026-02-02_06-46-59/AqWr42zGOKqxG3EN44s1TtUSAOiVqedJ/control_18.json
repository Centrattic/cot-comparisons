Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 who is upset because his fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. She explains it's because she wants to wait until after marriage due to her Catholic background and feelings of guilt. The author feels resentful because they didn't agree to wait when they started dating, and now it's causing issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they had a good sex life before engagement, and after the engagement, it changed. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in her religion and personal values. She might feel conflicted about her past choices and wants to align with her beliefs as they approach the wedding. The author didn't agree to this arrangement initially, which creates tension now.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The author tried to respect her initial reasons about body image but later found out it was about waiting until after marriage. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't part of the original agreement. The author is upset because their expectations weren't met, leading to resentment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without discussing it earlier, that's a problem. The author has the right to feel upset if their needs aren't being met. However, the author should also consider her feelings and the cultural/religious context. But the main issue here is that the decision to wait was made unilaterally after the engagement, which wasn't part of the original plan. The author isn't wrong for feeling hurt and resentful because their expectations were not aligned with her new decision. The fianc\u00e9e should have communicated this earlier if it was a deal-breaker. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
