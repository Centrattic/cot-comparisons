  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is engaged and upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has decreased after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9e attributes this to body image issues and Catholic upbringing, wanting to wait until after marriage. The author feels they didn't agree to wait and are now resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. When they started dating, neither expected to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior came after engagement, which might be a point of contention. However, it's important to note that people can change their views over time, especially influenced by personal beliefs or upbringing. The author might feel they didn't consent to this change, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid for her.\n\nThe author is upset about the lack of communication initially and the shift in their dynamic. But did they address it properly? They did confront her, and she shared her reasons. The author's resentment stems from unmet expectations, which is understandable, but expecting a certain level of physical intimacy without mutual agreement could be their issue. \n\nAlso, respecting her decision is part of a healthy relationship. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but maybe in the wrong for not addressing it earlier or for not considering her feelings. However, the fianc\u00e9e's change in desire is her right, and the author's frustration comes from a place of unmet needs they may not have discussed adequately from the start. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author didn't set boundaries about waiting, and the fianc\u00e9e made a choice based on her values. The author's resentment might stem from not having that conversation earlier. But the fianc\u00e9e's actions are her own, and the author might be in the right to express their feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author didn't set clear expectations and the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her beliefs, maybe the author is partially at fault for not addressing needs sooner. But I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they have a right to feel they made a compromise that wasn't mutual. Wait, no, the fianc\u00e9e's choice isn't a compromise but her personal choice. The author should have discussed their expectations about sex and boundaries before marriage. If they didn't, maybe they are in the wrong for not having that conversation. So, the answer might be A.\n"
