Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: the author is engaged and wants to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e. They say their sex life was good before engagement but dropped off after. The fianc\u00e9e mentioned body image issues and psoriasis, but later admitted she's waiting until marriage to have sex again because of her Catholic background and feeling guilty. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand, and now there's a change in their dynamic, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9e's reasoning is rooted in her religious beliefs and personal values. She might feel conflicted because her previous relationships didn't involve abstinence until marriage, but now she's struggling with guilt as the wedding approaches.\n\nNow, the key questions here are: Did the author communicate their needs properly? Did the fianc\u00e9e have the right to change her stance after engagement? Is the author justified in feeling upset? \n\nThe author mentions they had conversations about the sex drive drop, respected her initial reasons, but when confronted, she revealed the new information. The author feels wronged because the expectation wasn't there when they started dating. But once engaged, maybe expectations can shift due to personal growth or values. However, the author didn't agree to this change, so they feel their needs are being neglected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. Both partners have valid points. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her personal beliefs, which are important. The author has the right to feel upset if this change affects their relationship. However, the author should also consider if there's a way to communicate and find a middle ground. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful, which are valid emotions. They aren't necessarily wrong for feeling that way, especially if the change was unexpected and hasn't been discussed thoroughly. However, the answer might depend on whether the author has been communicative and respectful of her reasons. The initial approach was respectful, but now with the new information, maybe the author needs to address their feelings without being accusatory. \n\nGiven that the author is seeking validation and is trying to understand their role in the situation, their perspective isn't entirely wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her beliefs, so it's complex. But the author isn't necessarily the asshole for being upset. The key is whether they've been considerate and tried to work through it. The answer here would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
