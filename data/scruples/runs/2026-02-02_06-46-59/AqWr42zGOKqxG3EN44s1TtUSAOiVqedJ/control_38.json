Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped significantly after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9 explains that she's feeling guilty due to her Catholic upbringing and wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and they're now resenting the change in their dynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was already in a sexual relationship before engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's desire decreased because she feels guilty about her past and wants to wait until marriage. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to that boundary from the start. \n\nI should think about communication and expectations. When they got engaged, maybe they should have discussed boundaries and expectations regarding their sex life. The fianc\u00e9e had body image issues initially, but the real issue emerged later. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels blindsided by her decision to wait until marriage. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement without prior agreement. The author had the right to expect continuity in their physical relationship unless there was a mutual decision to change it. However, the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her personal beliefs and feelings, which she's communicated, albeit late. \n\nThe author's resentment might be valid if the fianc\u00e9e didn't set this boundary earlier. The fianc\u00e9e's Catholic background and her friends' expectations could influence her, but she chose to have sex with others before, so this seems like a personal conflict she's dealing with. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the change wasn't discussed upfront. The fianc\u00e9e's decision affects the relationship dynamics without prior mutual agreement. The author has a right to feel upset if this was unexpected. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
