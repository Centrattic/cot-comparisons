  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because their partner is now saying she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex, even though they both didn't choose that route when they started dating. The partner mentions feeling guilty because of their Catholic background and her friends waiting until marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they expected a certain level of intimacy and are now upset when it's reduced. They respected the partner's initial reasons, like body image issues, but later found out it's about waiting until marriage. The author feels they didn't agree to that when they started dating, so it's a change post-engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religious background and personal feelings about her past. She might be dealing with guilt as the wedding approaches. The author is frustrated because their expectations aren't met, leading to resentment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, communication is key. They've had discussions, but maybe not enough to address the change in her stance. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels blindsided. However, the fianc\u00e9e changed her approach after the engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. The author's resentment is understandable if they expected a consistent level of intimacy. But the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her values and past experiences. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement. If the author didn't agree to that change, then the fianc\u00e9e's decision affects the author's needs. However, the author also needs to consider the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and background. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should have discussed their expectations about intimacy before marriage. The author might be in the wrong if they expected the fianc\u00e9e to maintain the same level of sexual activity without considering her evolving reasons. Alternatively, the fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her change in stance earlier. Since the author is upset about a change that wasn't discussed upfront, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the author might be overreacting if the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid and they didn't address it properly. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's expectations were communicated and whether the fianc\u00e9e's change was mutual. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after engagement without prior agreement, the author's frustration is valid. However, the author also needs to address it through communication rather than resentment. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author is upset because their partner's decision impacts their needs, but they didn't agree to it initially, maybe they are not in the wrong. However, if the author is expecting the partner to maintain a certain level of intimacy without considering her reasons, they might be in the wrong. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think the author's frustration is understandable, but the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her personal values. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but they need to handle it through open communication and mutual adjustment. However, since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, the author's resentment could be justified. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because they have a right to feel upset if their partner's change in expectations wasn't discussed beforehand. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering the fianc\u00e9e's perspective more. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given the details, I lean towards B.\n"
