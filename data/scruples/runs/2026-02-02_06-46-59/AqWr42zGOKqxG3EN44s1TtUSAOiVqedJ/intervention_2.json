Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after they got engaged, and when confronted, she explained that she originally wanted to wait until marriage to lose her virginity, but they didn't follow that path. Now she feels guilty and wants to wait again, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is upset because they expected a certain level of sexual intimacy, which has decreased significantly. They might feel confused or even cheated when their partner changed her stance after engagement. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has personal and religious reasons for changing her mind, which might be genuine and important to her.\n\nThe author respected her initial reasons (body image issues) and didn't push, but now feels resentful because the new reason came up later. They argue that they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, so this change is unexpected. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, communication is key in relationships. The fianc\u00e9's change in stance might be valid, but the timing and how it affects the author could make them feel neglected. However, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing their feelings. But maybe they should have discussed expectations about intimacy earlier, rather than waiting until after engagement. \n\nAlternatively, the fianc\u00e9's decision could be a personal boundary she's now trying to enforce, which the author didn't anticipate. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9's feelings and beliefs are also valid. It's a complex situation where both might have valid points. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage, but the fianc\u00e9 is changing her mind due to her background and guilt, maybe the author isn't wrong for feeling this way. But maybe they could handle it better without resentment. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's reasonable to feel upset when a significant change in intimacy occurs without prior agreement. But maybe there's nuance here. Wait, but the author might be expecting something they didn't agree to, so maybe they have a point. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9 is now making a choice based on her values, the author's reaction could still be valid. \n\nHmm, but the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after commitment, it's possible the author isn't wrong for being upset. So maybe answer B.\n"
