Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged, and they were having sex three times a week before the engagement. Now, after being engaged for a year, it's down to twice in the past year. The fianc\u00e9e first blamed body issues like weight gain and psoriasis, but after some discussion, she admitted that she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted with her ex and now wants to wait until after marriage. She comes from a Catholic background and feels guilty as the wedding approaches. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. They're ressentful now because the dynamic has changed.\n\nFirst, I should consider the expectations in their relationship. When they started dating, neither expected to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which is a significant shift. The author feels blindsided and upset because this new expectation wasn't discussed earlier. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons include cultural/religious background and personal guilt, but the author didn't sign up for that agreement. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author tried to respect her initial reasons but then had to confront her when things didn't improve. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance post-engagement is the main point. The author isn't the one who decided to wait; it's the fianc\u00e9e. The author is expressing frustration about the sudden shift in their relationship's sexual dynamics. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't ask her to wait until marriage. They were fine with the previous arrangement. The resentment is understandable if expectations were set and then changed without prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her choice, but the author is justified in feeling upset because it affects their relationship. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
