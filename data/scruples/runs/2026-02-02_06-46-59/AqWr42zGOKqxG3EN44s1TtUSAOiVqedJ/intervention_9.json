  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is engaged, and their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9e attributes it to body image issues and later reveals she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again, influenced by her Catholic upbringing and friends. The author is upset, feeling like this came up post-engagement and causing resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to be concerned about the change in their relationship, especially since it's affecting their intimacy. They tried to respect her initial reasons but felt ignored when the issue persisted. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons\u2014body image, religion, and wanting to wait until marriage\u2014are personal and valid. She might be dealing with emotional or cultural pressures. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they started dating, neither expected to wait until marriage. Now, after engagement, she's changed her stance. The author didn't agree to that initially, so it's a conflict in expectations. But the fianc\u00e9e is also acting on her own values and feelings, which she communicated after some time. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Maybe not entirely. It's natural to feel frustrated if your partner's needs or desires change, especially after a period of stability. However, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing their feelings, but they could be wrong in how they handle it, like developing resentment without addressing it constructively. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and shouldn't be dismissed, but the author is also entitled to their feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their expectations clearly from the start or if they're not considering her valid reasons. The fact that she came clean about her Catholic background and friends' influence suggests she's trying to be honest. The author needs to navigate this with empathy and find a middle ground, rather than fostering resentment. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they have to take responsibility for their part in the communication and expectations. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and given the options A (Yes) or B (No), I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but they need to handle it better. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid, but the change in dynamic post-engagement is a point of contention. The key is mutual understanding and communication, so the blame isn't solely on the author.\n"
