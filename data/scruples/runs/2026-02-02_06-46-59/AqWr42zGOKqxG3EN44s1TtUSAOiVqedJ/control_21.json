Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e now wants to wait until after marriage to resume sex, which wasn't part of their original agreement. They had a good sex life before engagement but now it's been about twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e brings up past feelings about her first time and Catholic upbringing, leading to guilt as the wedding approaches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating. The change came after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e is citing personal and religious reasons for this shift. The author feels resentful because their expectations weren't met. \n\nFrom a perspective of consent and agreement, if the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after they committed to marriage, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. They had a sexual relationship before engagement, and now it's being restricted without prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and religious, which are valid, but the author's feelings of being wronged might stem from the lack of prior discussion. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e might have her own reasons for the change, possibly linked to her upbringing or personal growth. The author respected her initial reasons (body image) but later found out it was about waiting until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to change things after engagement could be seen as a shift in her values, which the author didn't agree to. \n\nIn terms of communication, it's possible that the fianc\u00e9e didn't fully disclose her intentions earlier, leading to the author's frustration. The author's resentment isn't necessarily their fault since they were unaware of this expectation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as the author has a right to feel upset about unmet expectations. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance could be the issue here, not the author's feelings.\n"
