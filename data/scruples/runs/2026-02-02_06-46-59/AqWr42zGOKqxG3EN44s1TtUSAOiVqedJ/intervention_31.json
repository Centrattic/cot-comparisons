  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after engagement due to body issues and religious guilt about not losing her virginity \"properly,\" leading to her wanting to wait until marriage. The author feels upset and resentful because they didn't agree to wait, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons for reduced intimacy are valid\u2014body image issues and religious guilt are real emotional factors. The author respected her reasons initially but is now upset about the change in their dynamic. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, which was a change after engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her beliefs and self-esteem. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about her comfort and values now that marriage is near.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. The author's desire for intimacy is natural, but the fianc\u00e9e's decision to change her approach is her right. However, the author should have discussed this sooner and perhaps managed their expectations. But since the fianc\u00e9e is honest about her reasons, the author's frustration might be more about adjusting to her current needs. The question is whether the author's resentment is justified. \n\nGiven that the author respected initial reasons but now feels wronged by the prolonged change, it's possible the author is not entirely at fault. However, not respecting her decision to wait, even if it's uncomfortable, could be seen as selfish. The answer hinges on whether the author is holding her to an old agreement she never consented to. Since she changed her stance, the author's upset is understandable, but their resentment might be misplaced if they didn't communicate their own needs or if they're not respecting her current boundaries. \n\nIn some perspectives, both parties have valid points, but the author's frustration is due to a shift in expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) if we consider that the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, and the author is justified in feeling upset about the changed dynamic. But if the author should have accepted her decision despite their own needs, then A. But since the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Wait, but the author didn't agree to wait, so the fianc\u00e9e shouldn't be in a position to impose that unless they both agreed. But she changed her mind post-engagement. It's a bit tricky. The author's resentment is about a shift in the relationship's expectations, which is a common source of conflict. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but maybe they are in the wrong for not accepting her decision. It's a toss-up, but leaning towards B because the author's frustration is understandable given the changed circumstances, even if they should have communicated better.\n"
