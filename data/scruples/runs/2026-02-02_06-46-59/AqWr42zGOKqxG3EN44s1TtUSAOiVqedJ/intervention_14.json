Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the details first.\n\nSo, the author is engaged and is upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after they got engaged. Initially, they had a good sex life, but now it's down to twice a year. The fianc\u00e9e cited body image issues and some health stuff, but later explained that she didn't lose her virginity as she wanted, and now she wants to wait until after marriage. She comes from a religious background, and the wedding is approaching, which makes her feel guilty. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the dynamic has changed. They feel resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and fianc\u00e9e didn't agree to wait until marriage. The change in the fianc\u00e9e's stance came after engagement. The author is upset about the lack of physical intimacy and the sudden change in their relationship dynamic. The fianc\u00e9e has given reasons rooted in personal beliefs and family background. \n\nNow, from a relationship ethics perspective, communication is crucial. The author mentions they had conversations, but maybe they didn't delve deep enough into the fianc\u00e9e's feelings before the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and tied to her upbringing and beliefs. The author is now upset because the expectations have shifted, but perhaps they didn't consider these factors earlier. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e is now making a choice based on her values, which are valid even if they conflict with the author's expectations. The author might have a right to be upset because the change happened after the engagement, but they also need to respect her decision. If the author is resentful because they didn't agree to wait, then maybe they have a point about feeling misled. But if they accepted her religious background and potential changes when they got engaged, perhaps the issue is more about their own adjustment. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons, while valid to her, might not have been fully discussed before the engagement. The author might feel that they didn't get a say in this decision. But relationships require compromise, and if the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her beliefs, the author has to decide whether to support her or not. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's expectations were clear and discussed. If they didn't address the possibility of her wanting to wait until marriage before getting engaged, then maybe the author is in the right to be upset. However, if they knew about her Catholic background and the potential for this change, they might share some responsibility. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e's decision is a personal one, so the author's resentment might be misplaced. They should communicate their feelings and see if a compromise is possible. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the change happened after engagement without prior agreement, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid, so the author's resentment could be seen as not respecting her choices. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the correct answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the change in the fianc\u00e9e's stance wasn't agreed upon before the engagement, and the author has a right to feel affected. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author didn't take her background into consideration, maybe they are in the wrong. But the situation is complex.\n"
