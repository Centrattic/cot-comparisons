Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is engaged to be married in a few months. They had a good sex life before the engagement, but after, it dropped to twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e mentioned body image issues and some psoriasis at first, then later admitted she's feeling guilty because she didn't lose her virginity as she wanted and wants to wait until marriage. She comes from a religious Catholic background. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are consent and expectations. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, and neither did the fianc\u00e9e. But after engagement, she changed her mind. The author is frustrated because their previous understanding was not to wait, and now there's a conflict.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't agree to abstinence after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance later, which might be unfair. However, the author should consider her feelings and the reasons. But the fact that she didn't communicate this earlier and the author is now upset because their expectations were different could mean the author isn't the asshole. On the other hand, if the author was aware of her Catholic background and didn't push for sex earlier, maybe there's some responsibility. But since she only revealed the reason after the engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
