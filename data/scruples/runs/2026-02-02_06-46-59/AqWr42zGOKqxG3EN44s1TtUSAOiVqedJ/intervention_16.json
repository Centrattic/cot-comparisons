Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged, and the author is upset about it. The fianc\u00e9 mentioned feeling guilty because she didn't lose her virginity in the way she wanted and wants to wait until after marriage. The author is now resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is expressing their feelings of hurt and resentment. They had a good sex life before engagement but now feel like the dynamic has changed. The fianc\u00e9 has her reasons rooted in personal guilt and religious background. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I should evaluate if their expectations were communicated, if there's a lack of respect for the fianc\u00e9's boundaries, or if the author is acting unreasonably. The fianc\u00e9's reasons seem valid to her, and she's been open about them. The author respected her initial concerns but is now upset that the change is affecting their relationship. \n\nThe key points are consent and mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9 is not refusing sex entirely but has a desire to wait. The author's resentment suggests they might not be respecting her boundaries. However, the author is also within their right to feel upset if their needs aren't met. But since the fianc\u00e9 communicated her reasons and the author had prior knowledge of her background, maybe the author should have discussed this earlier. \n\nIt's a complex situation. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset, but if they're pressuring her or not respecting her wishes now, that could make them the asshole. The post says the author is beginning to resent her, which indicates they might be acting out of frustration. However, the fianc\u00e9 did explain her reasons after being asked, and the author had agreed to the engagement. So, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting her decision or communicating their own needs better. But the answer might hinge on whether the author is respecting her choice. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author is expressing their feelings and the fianc\u00e9 made a change in her behavior post-engagement, which the author is now adjusting to. However, there's a nuance. If the author is pressuring her, that's bad, but the post says they're resentful, not necessarily pressuring. So maybe they're not the asshole. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9 is making a valid choice and the author isn't respecting that, then the author is in the wrong. But the post says the author respects waiting until marriage but didn't sign up for it. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being resentful when they knew her background. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But since the fianc\u00e9 communicated her reasons and the author had agreed to the engagement, perhaps the author is not in the wrong for feeling upset, but maybe they should have addressed it earlier. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is human and has feelings, but maybe A if they're not respecting her choice. I'm leaning towards B because the fianc\u00e9 made the change, and the author is reacting, but not necessarily wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not accepting her decision. But I think the answer is B.\n"
