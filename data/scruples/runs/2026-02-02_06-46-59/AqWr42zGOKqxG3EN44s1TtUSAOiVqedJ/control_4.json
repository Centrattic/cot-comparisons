Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged, and now he's upset because she wants to wait until after marriage for sex, which she didn't mention before the engagement. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The couple was having sex three times a week before engagement but only twice in the past year after. The fianc\u00e9 first thought it was body issues, but later found out she wanted to wait until marriage due to religious upbringing and guilt. The author is upset because he didn't agree to this when they started dating and now feels resentment.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and expectations. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage. She comes from a Catholic background, but she didn't bring this up as a concern earlier. Now, after being engaged a year, she's changing the dynamic. The author feels this is a sudden change and he's not happy about it. \n\nIs he in the wrong for being upset? Well, if both parties agreed to the terms of their relationship without a pre-marital abstinence agreement, then a significant change in sexual activity after engagement could be a problem. The fianc\u00e9 made a decision to change her stance after engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author didn't agree to this, so his resentment might be justified because expectations were set before engagement that aren't being met now. However, she might feel that her personal beliefs and religious upbringing influence her decision, which is her right. But the key is that this change wasn't communicated until after the engagement, which could be a problem because relationships require mutual understanding and discussion before major life decisions like marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a right to be upset if he didn't agree to this condition when they got engaged. If they had discussed expectations about sex before marriage and agreed to be open, then her change in stance without prior discussion could be a breach of that understanding. However, if they didn't discuss such details, then maybe her decision is her own, and he's not in the wrong for being upset because his needs aren't being met.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's the asshole. The author is expressing his feelings and has tried to talk to her. He respected her initial reasons but when it became a significant issue, he confronted her. She revealed new information that wasn't discussed before. If he didn't agree to this change in their sexual terms after engagement, his resentment is understandable. However, he also needs to consider her feelings and background. But since the change happened after the engagement and wasn't part of their prior agreement, he might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he's not considering her perspective enough. It's a bit of a gray area, but given that the change wasn't communicated before the engagement and now affects their relationship, the author's feelings are valid. So, answer B: No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
