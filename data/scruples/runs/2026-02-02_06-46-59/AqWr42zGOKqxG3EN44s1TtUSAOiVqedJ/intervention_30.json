Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after engagement. The author feels upset and is starting to resent the fianc\u00e9e because she now wants to wait until marriage for sex, which wasn't part of their initial agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement but it decreased. She initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted and feels guilty about not waiting until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that when they started dating, and the change in dynamic is causing resentment.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key points here are communication and consent. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels blindsided. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also dealing with her own feelings and background. She comes from a religious family and now feels conflicted as the wedding approaches.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, the author had a different expectation. If they had known her stance on waiting until marriage, maybe they would have made a different decision. But since the decision to wait came after engagement, maybe the author is justified in feeling that their needs aren't being met. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also honest now, even though it's late. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for resenting her change in stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did respect her initial reasons and didn't push her. The issue is that the fianc\u00e9e's new reason (waiting until marriage) wasn't part of their original understanding. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations. But is that the author's fault? They might not be in the wrong if they communicated their needs and the fianc\u00e9e changed her position without prior discussion.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the fianc\u00e9e's change in sexual expectations was communicated early enough. If the author had known about her potential hesitation to wait until marriage, they might have made a different choice. But since she only revealed this after the engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author should also consider that people's views can change, especially under pressure from a wedding. But the author is also in a position where their needs are not being met, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion, leading to the author's resentment. The author isn't at fault for feeling upset about a fundamental change in the relationship's dynamic that wasn't agreed upon. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
