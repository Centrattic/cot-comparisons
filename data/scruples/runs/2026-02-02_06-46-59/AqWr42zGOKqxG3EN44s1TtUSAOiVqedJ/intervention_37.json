Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, and the author is upset about it. The fianc\u00e9 cites body image issues and religious guilt about waiting until marriage. The author claims they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially and feels resentful now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9 had a good sex life before engagement. After engagement, it dropped. The fianc\u00e9 gives reasons like body image and Catholic upbringing. The author didn't expect this change after engagement and feels the dynamic has shifted, leading to resentment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Communication, expectations, mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance post-engagement, which was a surprise to the author. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but now feels she's holding back without mutual agreement. The author might feel that since they didn't agree to wait until marriage, the sudden change is unfair. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons (personal values, guilt) are valid for her. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Maybe not entirely. It's natural to feel hurt if expectations shift without prior discussion. But the author also needs to consider her feelings and reasons. The fianc\u00e9's decision is based on her beliefs and insecurities. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but did they communicate clearly? The fianc\u00e9 did explain her reasons, so the author's frustration might be about adjusting to new circumstances. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's expectations were communicated and if both parties addressed the issue. The author didn't mention discussing boundaries after engagement. Resentment could indicate a lack of communication or compromise. However, the fianc\u00e9 made a valid point about her beliefs. \n\nIn AITA terms, both parties might share some responsibility. The author is upset about the change in dynamics, but the fianc\u00e9 has her own valid reasons. It's a complex situation where both could have communicated better. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not the author) because the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance without prior agreement, leading to the author's resentment. The author's feelings are valid in expecting some consistency unless there's mutual agreement on changes. So the answer is B.\n"
