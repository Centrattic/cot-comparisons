Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the engaged couple used to have a good sex life before engagement, but after getting engaged, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. The author is upset because they think it's a recent change and feels resentful. The fianc\u00e9e explains it's due to body image issues and her Catholic upbringing making her feel guilty as the wedding approaches, plus she didn't have her first time with her previous boyfriend as she wanted and now wants to wait until marriage.\n\nFirst, the author says they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage when they started dating. Both were with others before, so they didn't choose that route. Now, after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is changing their dynamic. The author is upset and feels resentful.\n\nI need to consider communication and mutual understanding. The fianc\u00e9e did communicate her reasons, which include personal and religious factors. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels it's a shift. The key points are: Did the author have prior knowledge about this stance? The fianc\u00e9e didn't mention this before engagement, only after. The author might feel blindsided because the decision came after the engagement, changing their expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e had valid reasons tied to her values. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful. It's not about right or wrong per se, but about expectations. Since they didn't discuss this before engagement, maybe the author didn't consider that the fianc\u00e9e might have changing feelings due to wedding-related anxiety or religious guilt. The author's resentment could stem from unmet expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate their needs and boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e did explain her reasons, so maybe the author should work on understanding and finding a compromise. But the author's feelings are also valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. Since the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her personal values and she communicated it, the author's anger might be misplaced if they didn't set clear expectations beforehand. However, it's possible both are struggling here. \n\nBut according to the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the answer depends on whether the author's reaction is unreasonable. The author is upset because the change happened after engagement, which they didn't agree to. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are genuine. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but the situation requires both to address the issue. Since the fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons and communicated them, the author's resentment might be due to not discussing expectations earlier. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for both to adjust. However, the answer options are A or B. Given that the author is not in the wrong for feeling upset but maybe should have discussed it earlier, the answer might be B (No).\n"
