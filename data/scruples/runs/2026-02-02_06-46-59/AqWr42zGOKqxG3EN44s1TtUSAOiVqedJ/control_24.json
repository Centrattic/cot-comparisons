Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e changing her stance on their sexual relationship after they got engaged. The author is upset because she's waiting until marriage now, which wasn't part of the original agreement when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a religious background and is feeling guilty as the wedding approaches. The author feels resentful about the sudden change and reduced sex drive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is engaged, and their fianc\u00e9e's behavior has changed. They had a good sex life before engagement but now it's much less. The fianc\u00e9e cites body image issues, religious guilt, and a desire to wait until marriage. The author argues that they both didn't choose to wait back then and that this change is causing them distress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to have sex is a natural desire, especially in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which isn't something the author signed up for. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also making a personal choice based on her beliefs and feelings now. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset because their needs aren't being met. On the other hand, they should consider her perspective and reasons. But the key point here is that the author is expressing their feelings of resentment due to a shift in the relationship dynamic after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait now, even if based on her values, is affecting the author's expectations. So, is the author an asshole? Maybe not entirely. They have a right to express their feelings, but maybe they should work on communication and understanding. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e's change is recent and the author is reacting to unmet needs, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong). But I need to check if the author is being unreasonable. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but when the reason changed, their resentment is valid. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait is her choice, but the author's frustration is understandable. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
