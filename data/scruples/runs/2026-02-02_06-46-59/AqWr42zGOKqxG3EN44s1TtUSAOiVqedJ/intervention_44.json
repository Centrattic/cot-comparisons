Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 and their partner have been engaged for a year, planning to marry soon. Their sex life was good before engagement but dropped significantly afterward. The fianc\u00e9 tried to respect the partner's initial explanation about body image issues but noticed a drastic decrease in intimacy. After some discussion, the partner revealed she wants to wait until after marriage for sex due to personal beliefs influenced by her Catholic upbringing and friends' experiences. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because neither of them chose this path when they started dating, and now the partner is changing things close to the wedding, leading to resentment.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior to engagement, both were comfortable with a regular sex life. Post-engagement, the partner's desire for sex dropped. The fianc\u00e9 respects the partner's reasons but feels it's a change of terms that wasn't discussed upfront. The partner's reasons include religious guilt and wanting to wait until marriage, which wasn't part of their original agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong. Now, in relationships, communication is crucial. The partner didn't mention this intention to wait until marriage when they started dating or even before engagement. The fianc\u00e9 felt they both didn't sign up for that, so the sudden change post-engagement is causing conflict.\n\nFrom a typical relationship advice perspective, if one partner changes their stance on something significant (like sexual activity) after commitments like engagement, it's important to discuss and align expectations. The fianc\u00e9's frustration is understandable because the partner's reasons were not communicated earlier, leading to unmet expectations and potential resentment. However, the partner's reasons are personal and rooted in her values, which the fianc\u00e9 may not have considered when they started dating.\n\nBut the core issue here is consent and mutual agreement. Since the partner changed her stance after the engagement, the fianc\u00e9 is justified in feeling upset because it's an unanticipated shift. However, the partner's feelings and beliefs are valid, and the fianc\u00e9 should ideally address this through continued communication rather than resentment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The fianc\u00e9 isn't in the wrong for feeling upset because the partner changed the terms of their relationship without prior discussion. But the partner isn't wrong for having her own reasons either. However, the key point is that the partner's decision to wait until marriage wasn't part of their initial agreement. The fianc\u00e9 didn't sign up for that, and the partner changed her position after the engagement, which is a significant change. Therefore, the fianc\u00e9's frustration is valid. \n\nBut in some perspectives, if the partner now feels guilty and wants to change their behavior close to the wedding, the fianc\u00e9 needs to adjust or find a middle ground. However, the fianc\u00e9's feelings of resentment might be justified if the partner didn't communicate this earlier. Since the partner's reasons emerged after the engagement, the fianc\u00e9 is within their rights to feel that this change is unfair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would depend on whether the change was communicated early enough and if both parties are in agreement. In this case, the partner's decision post-engagement without prior discussion leads to the fianc\u00e9's justified resentment. Therefore, the fianc\u00e9 isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. So the answer is B (No).\n"
