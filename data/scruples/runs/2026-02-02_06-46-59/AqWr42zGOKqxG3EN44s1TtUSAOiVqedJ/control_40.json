Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 changed her view on premarital sex and now wants to wait until after marriage. He feels it's late to bring this up since they didn't agree on that when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because their expectations were different. They had a good sex life before engagement, but now it's way less. The fianc\u00e9 explains it's due to Catholic upbringing and feeling guilty as the wedding approaches. She didn't mention this earlier, which the author feels is a problem because he didn't sign up for waiting until marriage. He's developing resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that after being engaged and nearing marriage, her beliefs and comfort levels are changing. She might feel pressured by her background to wait, and her body image issues could also play a role. Her decision isn't just about the author but possibly about her own values and anxiety about the wedding.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he agreed to get married, does that mean he's supposed to accept a change in their sexual relationship? But he argues they never discussed waiting until marriage when they started dating. He's upset because this change affects their current dynamic. However, maybe her reasons are valid, and he should have addressed the issue earlier. Yet, the problem is that her decision to wait came after engagement, which was a surprise to him. \n\nThe author is expressing his feelings of being wronged because the terms changed after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9 might not be in the wrong for changing her mind based on her evolving beliefs and pressures. However, the key point is whether the author is wrong for feeling upset. Since the situation involves mutual expectations and communication, the fault might be shared. But according to AITA rules, if the author's frustration is valid due to lack of prior agreement, he might not be wrong. Alternatively, if he didn't communicate his needs earlier, maybe he shares some blame. But the fianc\u00e9's sudden change without prior discussion could be an issue. The answer might be B (No) because he's justified in being upset if she changed the terms without prior agreement. However, if he's not respecting her reasons, maybe A. But given the information, the author's perspective is that he didn't expect this, so B seems more likely.\n"
