Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after engagement. The author is upset because they feel the partner is now choosing to wait until marriage, which wasn't part of their original agreement. The fianc\u00e9e comes from a religious background and feels guilty as the wedding approaches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels wronged because they didn't agree to waiting for marriage, and the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change is causing tension. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, might be dealing with internal conflicts from her upbringing and personal values. She mentioned body image issues initially, but the real reason came out later. The author respected her initial reasons but is now upset because the underlying issue is about waiting until marriage.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had conversations about the change in sex drive. The author didn't push too hard at first, which seems respectful. But now, the author is resentful because the fianc\u00e9e's values are affecting their relationship. The key points are consent and communication. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage, so expecting the fianc\u00e9e to change her stance now might be unfair.\n\nBut wait, the author is upset because their expectations aren't being met. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her personal beliefs, which she only recently shared. The author might feel misled if the fianc\u00e9e's reasons changed after the fact. However, the author also didn't express their own feelings about the lack of intimacy earlier. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might be in the right to express their feelings, but if they didn't address the issue sooner, maybe they share some responsibility. Alternatively, the fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her true reasons earlier. \n\nGiven that the author is now resentful and the fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior is causing conflict, it's a complex situation. The author's frustration is valid because their needs aren't being met, but the fianc\u00e9e's values are her own. However, the author should have addressed the issue earlier rather than waiting until resentment built up. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is resentful for not getting what they expected, but the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the author should consider that the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her values now, and perhaps they need to find a compromise. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They have a right to feel upset if their needs aren't being met, especially if they didn't agree to the terms initially. But maybe they could have communicated better earlier. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance without prior discussion. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
