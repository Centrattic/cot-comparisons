  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e. The situation is that after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly. She initially blamed body issues but later admitted she's feeling guilty due to her Catholic background and now wants to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is frustrated because their expectations around intimacy have changed. They were used to having sex three times a week, and now it's twice a year. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which the author didn't expect. The author might feel that since they didn't agree to a premarital abstinence, they're within their rights to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in her religious and cultural background. She's feeling guilty and has changed her mind about her sexual boundaries. She might have felt pressured to continue the previous level of intimacy but is now prioritizing her personal values. It's possible her Catholic upbringing has a significant impact on her feelings of guilt as the wedding approaches.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The author mentions they had conversations, but the change happened after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait might be a personal choice she's only now feeling the need to honor. However, the author might not have anticipated this change and feels that their needs are now being neglected. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about this shift.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to discuss and agree on expectations, especially regarding such intimate matters. Since they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, the fianc\u00e9e changing her stance later could disrupt the existing dynamic. However, people can change their views over time, and the fianc\u00e9e might be acting on her own moral or personal growth.\n\nThe author's resentment is understandable if they feel that their needs aren't being met and that the relationship's terms have shifted without prior agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to prioritize her religious values is also a significant factor. The question is whether the author's frustration is valid given that they didn't set these boundaries from the start.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for having needs and feeling upset when the relationship dynamic changes. The issue might stem from a lack of communication about sexual expectations earlier in the engagement. If the fianc\u00e9e had discussed her feelings of guilt and desire to wait sooner, the author might have been more prepared for the change. However, the author's resentment could also indicate a lack of flexibility or empathy towards his fianc\u00e9e's personal values.\n\nUltimately, the answer hinges on whether the author's expectations were communicated and agreed upon. Since there was no prior agreement to wait until marriage, the author's feelings of being wronged might be justified. However, the fianc\u00e9e's right to change her own mind and her religious beliefs also need consideration. The situation might be more about a mismatch in expectations rather than one person being in the wrong.\n"
