Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9e have been engaged for a year, getting married soon. Before engagement, they had a good sex life, but after, it dropped a lot. The fianc\u00e9e first blamed body image issues but later admitted she's holding off because she feels guilty due to her Catholic upbringing and wants to wait until after marriage, similar to her friends. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand and now feel resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to see if the author is at fault. The key points are communication and mutual expectations. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage, so the expectation was different. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance, which affects the relationship. The author is feeling wronged because the change happened after engagement, not before. \n\nBut wait, maybe the fianc\u00e9e had some unresolved feelings from her past (virginity not being lost as she wanted) that surfaced after engagement. Her Catholic background might influence her current feelings. The author respected her initial reasons but was surprised by the change. Did the author address this with her? They did confront her, so communication happened. The author is upset because their needs aren't being met now. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e is in a vulnerable position here, dealing with guilt and possibly anxiety about marriage. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her values. The question is whether the author is wrong to feel upset. Since they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, expecting a change now might be unfair. But the fianc\u00e9e is also navigating her own emotional issues. \n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up. The author isn't wrong to want a fulfilling sex life, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid for her. However, the author is expressing frustration because the terms changed after commitment. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and not malicious. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they need to communicate better and find a middle ground. Since the question is if the author is the asshole, considering the context, probably not. The answer might be B (No).\n"
