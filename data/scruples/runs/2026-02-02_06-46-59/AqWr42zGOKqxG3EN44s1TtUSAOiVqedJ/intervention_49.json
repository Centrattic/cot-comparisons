Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe person is engaged to be married in a few months. They had a good sex life before engagement, but after getting engaged, their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. They had conversations, and she initially blamed it on body image issues but later admitted she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again. She mentions her Catholic background and feeling guilty as the wedding approaches. The author is upset about the change, feels resentment, and is asking if they're the asshole for being upset.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The couple was already having sex before engagement, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement. The author didn't expect this and now feels resentful. The fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religious background and possibly societal expectations. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to respect her initial reasons (body issues) but eventually confronted her when the situation didn't improve. The fianc\u00e9e was honest about her true feelings after some prying. The author's issue is that they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating, and now the sudden change is causing tension.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author might feel that they made a commitment based on their previous understanding of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance after engagement could be seen as a shift in expectations that wasn't discussed upfront. However, the fianc\u00e9e is making a personal choice based on her beliefs, which might be valid for her. The author's resentment could stem from unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are also legitimate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? It depends on how we view the situation. The author isn't pressuring her into something; they're expressing disappointment about a change in their agreed-upon dynamic. However, the fianc\u00e9e has the right to change her mind about her sexual boundaries, especially if they relate to her personal or religious values. The author might be in the wrong if they expected the relationship to stay the same without considering her evolving feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for feeling upset. Relationships require negotiation, and expectations can shift. The key is whether the author is respecting her decision now. If they're trying to force the issue or not respecting her choice, that would be wrong. But the question is about being upset and resentful. Resentment can be a natural reaction to unmet expectations, but it's important to address it through communication and mutual understanding.\n\nIn this case, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but they should work on understanding her perspective and finding a solution together. The fianc\u00e9e's change might be a valid personal choice, and the author's reaction is understandable but needs to be handled with empathy. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid, and the situation requires both parties to communicate and adjust their expectations.\n"
