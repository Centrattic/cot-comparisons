Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e wants to wait until marriage for sex, which is a change after they got engaged.\n\nFirst, the key points: They were engaged for a year, had a good sex life before engagement, but it dropped significantly after. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage due to her Catholic background and friends' influence. The author feels upset and resentful because they didn't agree to that arrangement beforehand.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't part of their original understanding. The author is upset because their expectations changed. But the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in personal beliefs and religion. However, the author argues that they both chose not to wait when they started dating, so this sudden change is a problem.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e didn't mention her intention to wait until marriage earlier. The author felt respected when she first gave reasons about body image, but when the real reason came up later, it was a surprise. The author's resentment is understandable because the dynamic shifted without prior agreement.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? The author isn't demanding something unethical; they're expressing their needs. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her right, but she should have communicated it earlier. The author's frustration stems from unmet expectations and lack of communication. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to feel let down. So the answer is B.\n"
