  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a person who's upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. They were having sex three times a week before engagement but now only twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues like weight gain and psoriasis, but later admitted she had mixed feelings about losing her virginity in a way she didn't want with her last boyfriend and now wants to wait until marriage. She comes from a religious Catholic background and feels guilty as the wedding approaches.\n\nThe author is upset because they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage. They're resentful that the dynamic changed after engagement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which was unexpected. The author felt respected when they first discussed body issues but now feels betrayed because she didn't disclose this sooner. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and influenced by her upbringing and religious beliefs. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating, so this new condition affects their relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a right to feel upset if their expectations were not met. However, the fianc\u00e9e did try to explain her reasons, which are valid for her. The author might be in the right to express their feelings, but maybe they should have discussed this before the wedding. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior communication, which could also be problematic. The key points are communication and mutual expectations. Since the fianc\u00e9e only mentioned this after the engagement, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the author's resentment and the change in dynamic might be justified. But the question is about the author's wrongness. They might not be in the wrong because they're reacting to a change without prior agreement. However, they should have had this conversation earlier. But since the fianc\u00e9e didn't disclose her feelings until after engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about unmet expectations.\n"
