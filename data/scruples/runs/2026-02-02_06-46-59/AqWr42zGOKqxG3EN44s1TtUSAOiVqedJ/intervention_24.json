Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement because of religious and personal reasons. The author feels upset and is starting to resent his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were dating before engagement and had a regular sex life. After engagement, she stopped because of body issues and later revealed she wanted to wait until marriage. Her background is Catholic, which influences her feelings of guilt. The author is frustrated because he didn't sign up for that and feels the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nThe key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9e communicated her reasons after some discussions, and the author respected them initially. However, the change in their relationship's dynamic is causing him distress. The question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling upset and resentful.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because it's natural to feel upset when a significant change in intimacy occurs without prior discussion. However, he should have addressed it sooner and maybe explored compromises. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid, and the author's reaction might stem from unmet expectations. But since she did communicate her reasons, his resentment could be due to not processing that information fully. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid feelings. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction is justified given the communication that happened. However, given that the fianc\u00e9e did explain her reasons and the author had initial respect, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because his feelings are valid, but the situation requires more nuanced understanding.\n"
