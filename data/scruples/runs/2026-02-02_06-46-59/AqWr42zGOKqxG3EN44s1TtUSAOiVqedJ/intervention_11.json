Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after engagement, and now the author is upset because the partner is waiting until marriage to have sex, citing religious and personal reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage when they started dating, so this change after engagement is causing tension. The fianc\u00e9 has her reasons: body image issues, past experiences, and religious background. She did communicate this after some discussion, and the author respects waiting until marriage in general but is upset because it wasn't part of their original agreement.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. When they got engaged, their relationship status changed, which can affect dynamics. The fianc\u00e9's reasons seem valid\u2014body image, personal beliefs, and religious guilt. The author respected her initial reasons but is now frustrated because the frequency dropped significantly. The author might feel that their needs aren't being met, especially since they had a good sex life before engagement.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 did communicate her feelings, even if it took some time. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but they could be in the wrong if they didn't address the issue sooner or if they're not considering her perspective. The question is whether the author is the asshole for being upset and starting to resent her.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners need to negotiate their expectations. The author might not be wrong, but they could be approaching the situation with unmet expectations. The fianc\u00e9's decision to wait might be a valid choice, even if it wasn't part of the original agreement. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are understandable, but the fianc\u00e9's reasons are legitimate. However, the author not addressing it sooner or not being more understanding might tip the scale. Alternatively, the author is in the wrong for resenting her when she communicated her feelings. Hmm. I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The fianc\u00e9's honesty is good, but the author's reaction might be valid. So, the answer is B.\n"
