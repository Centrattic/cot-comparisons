Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after engagement, and now the author is upset because the partner wants to wait until marriage due to Catholic upbringing and guilt. The author is feeling resentful because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a committed relationship, engaged, and they had a good sex life before engagement. Now, the fianc\u00e9e wants to change things. The author is upset because they didn't agree to abstinence after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are related to her religious background and personal feelings about her past. She didn't mention this before, only after the engagement. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication, expectations, and mutual respect. The author tried to respect her initial reasons (body image) but when the real reason came up later, he's frustrated. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which the author didn't agree to. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should have discussed their expectations about sex and marriage earlier. The author might feel that the sudden change is unfair, especially since they didn't have this conversation when they started dating. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her values. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, it's natural to be upset if a significant change in the relationship dynamic occurs without prior agreement. But the author might be in the right to express their feelings. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is also valid based on her beliefs. It's a conflict of expectations. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole. The answer depends on whether the author is respecting her decision while also addressing his own needs. If he's resentful and not trying to find a middle ground, maybe he's partly at fault. But if he's honest about his feelings and they can't reach a compromise, it's a mutual issue. \n\nIn this case, the author might not be in the wrong because he didn't agree to the change. However, he should have addressed it sooner. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid, but she changed the terms after the engagement. So, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the situation involves conflicting expectations that were not discussed early enough.\n"
