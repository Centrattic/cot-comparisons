Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement because she wants to wait until marriage. The author is upset and feels resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. They had a good sex life before engagement. Now, after the engagement, the frequency dropped, and the fianc\u00e9 says she's feeling guilty due to her Catholic background and friends' influence. The author feels wronged because this change came after they got engaged, not during the dating phase.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual agreement. When they got engaged, maybe they should have discussed expectations about intimacy post-marriage. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after they were engaged, which might not be fair to the author. However, she has her reasons rooted in religion and personal values. But the author didn't agree to these terms initially. \n\nResentment can build if one partner's needs are unmet without prior agreement. The author's frustration is valid because the change in expectations happened after they committed to marriage. The fianc\u00e9's reasons might be genuine, but the timing of her decision could be problematic. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Since both partners should communicate their needs and boundaries early, and the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind after engagement without prior discussion, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
