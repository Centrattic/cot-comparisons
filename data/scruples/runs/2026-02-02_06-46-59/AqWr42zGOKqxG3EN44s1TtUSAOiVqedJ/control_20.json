Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is engaged and upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage because of religious upbringing and friends' influences. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the fianc\u00e9e wants to change things, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The author did talk to their fianc\u00e9e and she eventually opened up. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her background. The author respected her initial reasons but is upset about the change in their dynamic. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way.\n\nThe author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations. They didn't agree to wait until marriage, so expecting her to wait might not be fair. However, the fianc\u00e9e is making a personal choice now, possibly influenced by her religion and upcoming marriage. It's important to consider mutual respect and consent. The author might feel wronged because the terms of their agreement changed without prior discussion. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is making a choice based on her values, which she only realized later. \n\nThe key points are: the author didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, leading to decreased intimacy. The author is upset and resentful, which is understandable if they value open communication and agreed terms. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now making a personal decision, which the author might not have anticipated. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is expressing frustration because the terms of their relationship have changed without prior agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9e is making a valid choice, albeit a new one. The author's resentment might be a natural reaction to unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9e's decision is her own. The situation highlights a communication gap and differing expectations. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but the fianc\u00e9e's choice is also valid. The answer hinges on whether changing terms after engagement without prior discussion is acceptable. Since the author didn't agree to wait until marriage, their frustration is legitimate. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
