Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their fianc\u00e9e having a sexual relationship before engagement, but after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e now wants to wait until after marriage, which wasn't part of their initial agreement. The fianc\u00e9e has Catholic upbringing and feels guilty as the wedding approaches.\n\nThe author is frustrated, feeling that the change in dynamic is causing resentment. They mention that they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage when they started dating, and now it's becoming a bigger issue. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons include religious guilt and not losing her virginity as she wanted with her previous partner.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the assessment. So, I need to consider both sides. The author is upset because their expectations weren't met. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, possibly due to her background. The author is respecting her reasons but is now resentful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The fianc\u00e9e made a choice post-engagement, which might not be the author's fault. However, the author didn't push the issue when she first mentioned body issues, which was respectful. Now that there's a new reason (religious guilt), the author is feeling left out. But the author is also expecting her to come around, which she hasn't. \n\nThe key points: the author isn't pressuring her, but they're upset about the change. The fianc\u00e9e's change is due to her own values and background, which are valid. However, the author's resentment is understandable if communication isn't happening. \n\nIn AITA posts, usually, if both parties have valid points but one is acting unreasonably. The author is expressing frustration without being abusive. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and not the author's fault. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but the situation shows that both have valid perspectives. However, the author's resentment might be a result of unmet expectations, but they didn't force the issue. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're respecting her reasons but are upset because their needs aren't being met. It's a communication issue rather than the author being wrong.\n"
