Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9. The situation is that after engagement, the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped significantly. The author is upset because they feel this change happened after the engagement, and the fianc\u00e9 brought up reasons like body image and Catholic guilt. The author respects waiting until marriage but didn't agree to it initially. Now they're resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple was already sexually active before engagement. Post-engagement, the fianc\u00e9's desire decreased. The fianc\u00e9 cites personal issues and religious upbringing as reasons. The author feels they didn't consent to waiting until marriage, so they're upset. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. It's a relationship issue where both parties have different expectations after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9 is choosing to wait, even though they both previously didn't follow that. The author didn't agree to that, leading to resentment. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9 tried to explain reasons, but the author feels blindsided because it wasn't discussed earlier. The fianc\u00e9's change in behavior might be valid for her, but the lack of prior discussion could be an issue. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. \n\nBut the author might not be in the wrong because they didn't agree to wait until marriage. However, they also didn't push the issue until later, respecting her initial reasons. The fianc\u00e9's decision to change their dynamic after engagement could be problematic, especially without prior agreement. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author's feelings are valid, but so is the fianc\u00e9's need to align with her values. However, since the author didn't consent to this change, they might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as both have valid perspectives but the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
