Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9's significant drop in sex drive after engagement, attributed to her Catholic upbringing and a desire to wait until after marriage, even though they didn't choose that path initially.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is upset because the sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to resentment. The fianc\u00e9 had a change of heart about premarital sex, influenced by her religious background and friends. She initially blamed body issues but later revealed her deeper reasons. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they started dating, neither was waiting until marriage, so the fianc\u00e9's decision to change her stance after engagement might not have been discussed openly. The author is frustrated because the dynamic shifted without prior agreement. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, it's important to consider mutual respect and understanding. The fianc\u00e9 is acting on her personal beliefs and values, which are significant in her religion. However, the author's feelings of being let down or resentful are valid too. The issue is whether the author has a right to feel wronged. Since they didn't discuss this change before engagement, the author might feel blindsided. But the fianc\u00e9 is now making a choice based on her beliefs. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the fianc\u00e9 decided to wait after engagement, maybe she should have discussed it earlier. However, the author's resentment stems from not being consulted in that decision post-engagement. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. But the question is about the author's wrongness. The author is not in the wrong for being upset because the fianc\u00e9's change in stance affected their relationship without prior discussion. However, the author's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be her right, but the author's feelings are legitimate. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
