Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive decreased after the engagement, leading to the author feeling upset and resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They were engaged for a year, married in a few months. Before engagement, good sex life, but after, it dropped. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body image issues, but later revealed she wants to wait until after marriage because of her Catholic background and friends' influence. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the dynamics have changed.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling wronged because their fianc\u00e9 changed her stance on premarital sex post-engagement, leading to a significant decrease in intimacy. They feel they didn't sign up for this and are developing resentment. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The fianc\u00e9 has a valid reason rooted in her personal beliefs and upbringing. She didn't hide this initially but came forward after some time. The author respected her reasons at first but is now upset because of the change in circumstances. \n\nIt's important to note that both partners' needs and feelings matter. The author's frustration is understandable, but the fianc\u00e9's decision is based on her evolving values. However, the key here is that this decision was made after the engagement, not from the start. The author might feel betrayed or misled if this wasn't discussed earlier. \n\nBut since the fianc\u00e9 did explain her reasons, albeit after some prompting, and the author chose to respect her initial reasons, maybe the author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision is her right, especially given her personal beliefs. The author's anger might stem from not having these expectations set from the beginning. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author didn't discuss their expectations about intimacy and premarital sex before engagement, they might share some blame. But the fianc\u00e9 changing her stance post-engagement could still be a point of contention. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely depends on whether the fianc\u00e9's decision is a reasonable one and if the author's reaction is fair. Since the fianc\u00e9 came forward with her reasons and the author chose to respect them initially, but now feels upset, it's a conflict of expectations. However, the author is not in the wrong if they feel their needs are unmet. But if the fianc\u00e9's decision is a personal choice based on her beliefs, then the author's frustration might not be unjustified. \n\nBut in terms of moral responsibility, the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is expressing their feelings and seeking validation, which is reasonable. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision is also valid. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since both sides have valid points, but the author is expressing their hurt and seeking advice, the answer might be B.\n"
