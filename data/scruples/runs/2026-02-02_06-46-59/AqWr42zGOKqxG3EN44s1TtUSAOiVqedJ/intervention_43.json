  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped significantly after they got engaged, and the fianc\u00e9 now wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again. The author is upset about this change and is starting to resent their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9 had a good sex life before engagement but now is avoiding it. The fianc\u00e9 attributes this to body image issues and religious guilt from Catholic upbringing. The author is okay with waiting until marriage in general but didn't expect this change after they were already engaged. They feel the dynamic has shifted and are resentful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's accurate. Let's break it down. The fianc\u00e9's reasons for the change are valid personal and religious factors. The author had discussions about the issue, and the fianc\u00e9 eventually explained her feelings. The author respected her reasons initially but is now upset because the dynamic changed. The key points here are communication, mutual understanding, and expectations.\n\nThe author is upset because the change happened after they were engaged, and they didn't agree to this from the start. However, the fianc\u00e9 is making a personal choice based on her beliefs. The author might be in a position where they need to adjust their expectations, but it's also about whether they communicated their needs and expectations about sex and intimacy before marriage. If the author didn't discuss the importance of maintaining a sexual relationship post-engagement, then maybe they share some responsibility. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's decision to wait could be a valid personal choice, especially rooted in her upbringing and beliefs.\n\nIt's possible that both parties have valid points. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author expressed their feelings, but the fianc\u00e9's choice is a new development based on her internal conflict. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't obligated to maintain the same level of intimacy if her personal beliefs have changed. So perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is a binary choice: A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering that the fianc\u00e9 made a conscious decision based on her beliefs and the author didn't agree to it when they started dating, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author might be expected to respect the fianc\u00e9's choice, even if it's a change after engagement. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has a legitimate concern about the sudden change affecting their relationship, but the fianc\u00e9's reasons are also valid. Alternatively, if the author didn't address the issue earlier, maybe they are at fault. But given the information, the author did confront the fianc\u00e9, so they tried to communicate. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because the situation involves conflicting expectations that were not fully discussed before the engagement.\n"
