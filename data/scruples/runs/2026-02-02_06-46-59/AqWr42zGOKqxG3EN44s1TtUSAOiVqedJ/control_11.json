Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in sexual desire after engagement, citing Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because their expectations weren't met.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they had a good sex life before engagement but it dropped significantly after. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body issues but later revealed she wants to wait for sex until after marriage. The author feels they didn't agree to that when they started dating and now resents the change.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to respect the fianc\u00e9's reasons initially but felt ignored or unaddressed. The fianc\u00e9's change in stance after engagement might be a personal shift, but it's important if this was discussed earlier. The author's resentment is valid if they felt misled or if expectations weren't aligned. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision to wait could be based on her beliefs and values, which she might not have considered important before engagement. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind after the engagement, and the author didn't agree to that condition initially, then the author isn't wrong for feeling upset. They have a right to their own expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and religious, which the author might need to respect. But since the author didn't agree to this term when they started dating, it's a conflict in expectations. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's a communication breakdown. The answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid feelings about unmet expectations. The fianc\u00e9's change might not be communicated properly, leading to the conflict.\n"
