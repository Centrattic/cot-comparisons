Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in the situation described. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped significantly after engagement, leading to the author feeling upset and resentful. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple was engaged a year ago and had a good sex life before. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9's sex drive plummeted. She initially blamed body issues, then later confessed she wanted to wait until marriage due to her Catholic background and feelings of guilt as the wedding approaches. The author feels upset because they didn't agree to abstinence at the start and now the dynamic has changed.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. When they started dating, neither intended to wait, but post-engagement, the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance. The author is frustrated because the change in their dynamic is affecting their relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners need to discuss and align their expectations. If one partner significantly changes their stance on something as important as sexual activity, especially without prior discussion, it can create tension. However, the author's resentment might be valid if there was no prior agreement. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and tied to her religious background and self-image. \n\nThe author's response to confront and express frustration is understandable, but the answer depends on whether the fianc\u00e9's decision was communicated clearly and if there was mutual understanding. Since the change happened after engagement without prior discussion, the author might feel blindsided. However, respecting her decision is also crucial. The author's resentment could stem from feeling that their needs aren't considered, but the fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid for her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset if the change was unilaterally decided. However, the fianc\u00e9's disclosure about her reasons is a valid explanation. The author might not be wrong in feeling hurt, but they need to address it through communication rather than resentment. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as the issue stems from a lack of prior agreement and sudden change, which is a common source of conflict.\n"
