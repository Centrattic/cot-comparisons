Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive has dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e suddenly wants to wait until marriage, even though they both didn't choose that route when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e has a religious background and now feels guilty, leading to the change in their sexual activity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because the situation changed after engagement. They expected a certain level of intimacy that's now decreased, leading to resentment. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has personal and religious reasons for wanting to wait, which she explains after some discussion. She mentioned body image issues initially but later revealed deeper reasons tied to her beliefs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The key points here are the expectations set when they started dating versus after engagement. If they both didn't choose to wait when they started, but now she's changed her stance, that could be a problem. However, people can change their perspectives, especially when nearing marriage. The author might feel that the sudden change affects their relationship dynamic. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her religious upbringing, which she's now choosing to honor.\n\nIs expecting consistency in sexual activity a reasonable expectation? The author might feel that the fianc\u00e9e is holding them back without prior discussion. However, the fianc\u00e9e has communicated her reasons, even if it took time. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but now feels upset when the real reason is revealed. \n\nResentment is a big factor here. If the author is resenting her for a change in stance that's based on her values, maybe that's an issue. But if the author didn't know about her feelings beforehand, they might have a right to be upset. However, the engagement is a step where people might adjust their expectations. The problem is whether the fianc\u00e9e communicated her intentions clearly earlier or if the author should have expected possible changes as the wedding approaches.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not in the wrong if they feel their needs aren't met, but they might need to address it with empathy. The fianc\u00e9e is also navigating her own values. The situation is complex, but the author's frustration isn't entirely unfounded if there was no prior discussion about waiting. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to change her stance after engagement might be seen as a personal choice she's entitled to make, even if it affects the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author is wrong for being upset. If the fianc\u00e9e communicated her reasons now, the author's frustration is valid. But if the author expected a consistent approach and the fianc\u00e9e changed without prior conversation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and might not be entirely avoidable. I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're expressing valid feelings about a change that affects their relationship. But I'm a bit conflicted because both sides have valid points.\n"
