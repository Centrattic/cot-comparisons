Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged, and their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after the engagement. Initially, the fianc\u00e9e blamed body image issues, but later admitted it's about waiting until marriage. She comes from a religious background and feels guilty as the wedding approaches. The author is upset, feeling they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now they're resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on premarital sex after engagement. The author is frustrated because their expectations weren't met. But was there a prior agreement? The key point here is whether the author and fianc\u00e9e discussed and agreed on their sexual expectations before getting engaged. If they didn't, then the fianc\u00e9e's decision post-engagement might be unexpected for the author.\n\nThe author mentions they had conversations about the decreased sex drive. The fianc\u00e9e gave reasons, and the author respected them. But when the real reason came out, it's about a personal change in her values post-engagement. The author might feel blindsided because they didn't agree to wait then.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's Catholic background and her friends' influences might have led her to this decision later. She might be struggling with guilt and trying to align her actions with her values now. The author is in a bind because they didn't expect this change after they already committed to marriage.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the engagement. But was the author in the wrong for not discussing this earlier? If they didn't have prior discussions about their sexual expectations before getting engaged, then maybe the fianc\u00e9e isn't entirely to blame. However, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which affects the author. The author's resentment is valid if this change was not discussed beforehand and it's impacting their relationship.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's frustration stems from unmet expectations. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait is her personal choice, but it was made after the engagement. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, especially if they didn't agree to this change. However, maybe the author could have communicated their needs better or discussed this topic earlier. But since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, the author's resentment might be justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage, so expecting that isn't their fault. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her right, but the change came after the engagement, leading to conflict. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe both could have had more open communication. However, the question is if the author is the asshole. Considering that the author is expressing their feelings of being blindsided and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, the answer might be B (No).\n"
