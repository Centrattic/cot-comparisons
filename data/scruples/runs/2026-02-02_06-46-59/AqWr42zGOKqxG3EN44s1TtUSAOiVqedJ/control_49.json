Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being upset about their fianc\u00e9e changing her stance on having sex after they got engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They were dating for a while before engagement, had a good sex life, then after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. She initially blamed body image issues but later admitted that she wants to wait until marriage. She comes from a religious background and feels guilty now that the wedding is near. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, and they're developing resentment.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication, expectations, and changes in the relationship dynamic. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage, so their initial understanding was that they would be sexually active. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior is causing tension. The author feels it's a recent shift and is upset about the lack of sex now.\n\nThe key issues here might be about consent and mutual agreement. When they got engaged, did they discuss their expectations about their sex life post-marriage? The fianc\u00e9e decided to change her stance based on her religious background and personal feelings of guilt, which is her choice. However, the author didn't agree to this change and is now upset. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to have open and honest communication about their needs and expectations. If one partner changes their stance without discussing it and it affects the other partner's well-being, that could be a problem. The author is not wrong for feeling upset if they didn't agree to the change. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait might be based on her personal values and mental health, which should also be respected. \n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset. The question isn't about whether the author should be more understanding, but if they are at fault for feeling resentful. Since the terms of their sexual relationship changed without prior agreement and it's affecting the author's satisfaction, the author's feelings are valid. However, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective also needs to be considered. The answer might depend on whether the author is being unreasonable in their expectations versus the fianc\u00e9e's legitimate reasons. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to negotiate and find a middle ground. If the author didn't agree to the change, they have a right to express their feelings. But if the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are genuine and she's making a personal choice, then the author's resentment could be seen as valid but not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the fianc\u00e9e changed the terms without prior agreement, leading to the author's distress. However, the author could also be expected to communicate their needs better. The situation is complex, but since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (No), as the author's feelings are a reaction to a change in the relationship's terms without mutual consent.\n"
