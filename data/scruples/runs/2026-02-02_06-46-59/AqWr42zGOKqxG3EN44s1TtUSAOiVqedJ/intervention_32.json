Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped significantly after engagement. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e started to want to wait until marriage for sex, which wasn't part of their original agreement when they started dating. The author feels resentful now because of this change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement but now is holding back, citing body image issues and a religious background. She comes from a Catholic family and has friends who waited until marriage. She explains she didn't have her first time with her previous boyfriend as she wanted and feels guilty now that the wedding is near. The author respects waiting until marriage in general but didn't agree to it when they started dating. Now, he's upset because the dynamic changed after engagement, leading to resentment.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a committed relationship and chose to get engaged. Marriage involves making compromises. The fianc\u00e9e's religious beliefs and personal feelings about her first time might be valid reasons for her stance. She has her own reasons, and the author initially respected her body image concerns. However, the author is now upset because the terms of their relationship changed after engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after engagement, which is a significant life milestone. The author has the right to feel disappointed if his expectations for the relationship were not met. However, he should have discussed this earlier if it was a deal-breaker. Maybe the fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her feelings sooner too.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual expectations. The author waited until the issue became a problem before confronting her, which might have led to resentment. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which could be a deal-breaker for the author. But is it the author's fault for being upset? Or is the fianc\u00e9e responsible for not addressing her feelings earlier?\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to be clear about their expectations. If the author didn't like the idea of waiting until marriage, maybe he should have discussed this when she first mentioned her concerns. However, since the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after engagement, the author is within his rights to feel upset. But is he in the wrong for being upset? Or is this a mutual issue?\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. However, he chose to engage in a long-term relationship with someone who now has different expectations. The answer might depend on whether the author's expectations were communicated earlier. Since he didn't address it until after the engagement and now feels resentful, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, he should have had these conversations earlier. Alternatively, the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance is a significant issue that needs to be resolved. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's expectations were clearly communicated and whether the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance was reasonable. Since the author didn't address it earlier, maybe he's partially responsible. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author is now resentful and the fianc\u00e9e's stance changed after engagement, it's possible he's not entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's within his rights to be upset about a change in expectations that affects their relationship.\n"
