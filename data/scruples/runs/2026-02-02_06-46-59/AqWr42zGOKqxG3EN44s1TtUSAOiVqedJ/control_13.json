Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the partner now wants to wait until marriage, even though they didn't choose that route when they started dating. The author feels they didn't sign up for that, and they're starting to resent their partner for the change.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the change in sexual activity after engagement, the reasons given by the fianc\u00e9e (body image issues, Catholic background, guilt), and the fianc\u00e9's feelings of being wronged because the decision to wait was made after the engagement, not at the start of the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e did discuss her body issues initially, but later revealed deeper reasons tied to her upbringing and religion. The author respected her initial concerns but now feels it's impacting their relationship. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, both partners have the right to their boundaries. If the fianc\u00e9e is now choosing to wait until marriage due to personal beliefs and has communicated this openly, she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the author's feelings of resentment might stem from unmet expectations. It's important to consider if they had discussions about expectations regarding sex before engagement. If they didn't, then the author might feel blindsided, but that doesn't automatically make him wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on her values and religious upbringing, which are valid. However, changing expectations after a relationship has progressed could affect the dynamic. The author is entitled to his feelings but needs to address them through communication rather than resentment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e communicated her reasons clearly, and the author's issue is with the timing of her decision (post-engagement) rather than the decision itself, then it's more about differing expectations. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but he needs to handle it constructively. However, the fianc\u00e9e's right to change her stance is also valid. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is expressing valid concerns about unmet needs and a change in relationship dynamics, especially if they hadn't discussed long-term expectations like premarital sex before getting engaged. But if the author should have addressed this earlier, maybe A. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the circumstances, the answer is likely B.\n"
