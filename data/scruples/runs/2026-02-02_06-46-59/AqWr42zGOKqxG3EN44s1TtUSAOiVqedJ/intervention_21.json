Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about their fianc\u00e9's sudden decline in sex drive after engagement, leading to conflict and resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9's sexual interest dropped significantly after engagement. The fianc\u00e9 attributes this to body image issues and a religious belief about waiting until marriage. She had a different background and didn't wait before, but now, as marriage approaches, she feels guilty and wants to wait. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating and now feel resentful.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual expectations and communication. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage. The change came after engagement. The author respected her initial reasons but found out it was about waiting until marriage, which wasn't part of their original agreement. The author feels it's unfair because they didn't consent to this shift in their relationship dynamic.\n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9 did mention her reasons\u2014body image and religious guilt. The author tried to be understanding at first. However, the fianc\u00e9 didn't share this deeper reason until after the sex drive had dropped. The author now feels resentful because the dynamic has changed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful, which is a valid emotion. However, are they at fault for not accepting the fianc\u00e9's new stance? If they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started, and the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind after engagement, it's a matter of whether the author is respecting her boundaries or if they're being unreasonable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is also changing her own boundaries post-engagement, which might not have been discussed earlier. The author may feel that they entered the engagement with the understanding of their previous sexual relationship. If the fianc\u00e9 now wants to change that, it's a significant shift. However, the author's resentment might be because they feel blindsided. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, maybe the author is not in the wrong for being upset. They have the right to feel that their expectations were not met. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 is being honest now and the author is struggling with that honesty, the fault could be on both sides. But the author is not the one who changed the rules. The fianc\u00e9 made a choice that affects the relationship, and the author is reacting to that. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong if they are prioritizing their own sexual needs over the fianc\u00e9's stated boundaries and reasons. But the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and tied to her beliefs and feelings. The author could be respecting her choice even if it's different from their initial agreement. \n\nHowever, the author is feeling resentful and is asking if they're the asshole for it. The question is whether that resentment makes them in the wrong. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong for feeling that way, but maybe they should work on communication and understanding. But in terms of being in the wrong, if the fianc\u00e9 is honest and the author is having a valid emotional response, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9 did change her stance after engagement without prior discussion. The author might have expected consistency in their sexual relationship. The author's resentment is a natural reaction to the change in expectations without prior agreement. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. They might not be the asshole here. \n\nBut I need to remember that the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and she's being honest now. The author could be adjusting to this new information. However, the original arrangement wasn't to wait until marriage. The author's feelings are valid, but the fianc\u00e9's decision is also her right. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. Maybe the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong; the situation is complex and both parties have valid perspectives.\n"
