Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple was engaged a year ago, with a good sex life before. Post-engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive decreased. She initially blamed body issues but later revealed she's Catholic, and her religious background is making her feel guilty. She wants to wait until after marriage for sex, even though they both didn't wait when they started dating. The author is upset because this change came after the engagement, leading to resentment.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual respect. The author mentions that they had conversations about the issue, and the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in her religious beliefs and personal feelings. The author didn't agree with the change, which came up after they were already engaged. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset about this shift.\n\nIn relationships, expectations can evolve, especially as milestones like marriage approach. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might be based on her personal growth and religious values, which she's now prioritizing. The author, however, feels they didn't agree to this when they started dating, leading to a conflict. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations and the change in dynamics post-engagement.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9e is being honest about her reasons and they are valid to her, then maybe the author needs to adjust. However, the author is also within their rights to feel upset if this change affects their relationship. The issue here is whether the author's expectations were communicated and whether the fianc\u00e9e's decision was made in bad faith. Since the fianc\u00e9e explained her reasons and it's related to her beliefs, the author's anger might be more about the change in circumstances rather than the fianc\u00e9e being wrong. But the author didn't agree to this condition when they started the relationship, which complicates things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is mutual responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, especially if the change came unexpectedly. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. The problem might be more about communication and finding a compromise rather than one party being the \"asshole.\" The author's resentment might be justified if they feel the change was unilateral and not discussed earlier. But they also had the chance to address it, and the fianc\u00e9e did explain her reasons. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but it's a mutual issue. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is expressing valid feelings, though they need to work on understanding the fianc\u00e9e's perspective.\n"
