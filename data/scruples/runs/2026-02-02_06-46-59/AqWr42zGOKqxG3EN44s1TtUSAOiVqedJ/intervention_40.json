Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after the engagement, and the author is upset about it. The fianc\u00e9 gave reasons related to her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until after marriage, which she only mentioned after the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a good sex life pre-engagement but it decreased post-engagement. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she wanted to wait until after marriage, influenced by her religious background and friends. The author feels resented because they didn't agree to this arrangement beforehand.\n\nNow, thinking about AITA criteria. The author is upset because the change in sexual frequency is affecting their relationship. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't part of their original agreement. The author is in a committed relationship, expecting intimacy as part of the partnership. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and religious, but they only came up after the engagement, which might be a point of contention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author respected her initial reasons (body image issues) for a year, which shows consideration. The fianc\u00e9's sudden shift in stance could be a problem, especially since they didn't discuss this before engagement. The author's resentment is understandable if they expected the pre-engagement dynamic to continue. However, the author might also need to consider if there's a middle ground, like counseling or adjusting expectations. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to assess if their feelings are justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid, but the timing of her revelation might be an issue. The author's frustration stems from unmet expectations. In relationships, both partners should communicate their boundaries and expectations early. If the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind after the engagement, that's a new development. The author's reaction is based on feeling blindsided and unfulfilled. However, the author is also in a position where they chose to engage in a relationship knowing the fianc\u00e9's background. But the key point is the change post-engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong; they have a right to be upset about a significant change in their relationship's dynamic. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
