Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about their fianc\u00e9e's sudden decision to wait until marriage for sex, after they had a good sex life before engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was engaged for a year, with the wedding coming up. Before engagement, they had a regular sex life, but after engagement, it dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage, influenced by her Catholic background and friends. The author feels upset and resentful because this wasn't discussed earlier, and they didn't agree to that arrangement when they started dating.\n\nSo, the key points are: the change in sexual frequency post-engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons (both personal and religious), and the author's feelings of being caught off guard and resentful. The author is questioning if they're the asshole here for being upset.\n\nI should think about relationship norms and communication. It's important that both partners have mutual understanding and agreement on such significant changes. The fianc\u00e9e introduced a new term (waiting until marriage) after the engagement, which wasn't part of their original understanding. This sudden shift without prior discussion could lead to resentment. The author's feelings are valid because they didn't consent to this change when they started the relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her values, which she's now choosing to prioritize. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author feels they didn't agree to this condition and it's causing tension, they are within their rights to express their feelings. However, the fianc\u00e9e's choice is her own, and the author might need to find a middle ground. But the main issue is the lack of prior agreement. Since the change was introduced post-engagement, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The problem might be more about poor communication before the engagement.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset when the terms of the relationship changed without prior agreement. Both parties need to communicate better, but the author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
