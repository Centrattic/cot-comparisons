  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9e have been engaging in a sexual relationship, but after getting engaged, her sex drive dropped. Now she's explaining that she wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic upbringing and some guilt about how she lost her virginity before. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and they're starting to resent her for changing their dynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because the sexual aspect of their relationship has decreased significantly after engagement. They had a good sex life before, which now feels different. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religious background and feelings of guilt. She's trying to adjust her behavior as their marriage approaches, which might not have been discussed earlier.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. When the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped, the author tried to respect her initial reasons (body image issues) and didn't push further. When confronted, she revealed deeper personal reasons related to her beliefs. The author now feels blindsided because this wasn't part of their earlier discussions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force the engagement or the change in the relationship. They tried to be respectful and understanding initially. However, their resentment is growing because they feel the change was sudden and not discussed when they were in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on waiting until marriage after the engagement, which wasn't part of their original agreement. \n\nBut maybe the author should have addressed this issue earlier. Perhaps they could have had a conversation about expectations regarding sex and religion when they were dating, not just after the engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's explanation came after the author pursued it, so it's possible she was processing her feelings and didn't realize how it would affect the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is valid. A significant change in intimacy can strain a relationship, especially if it's not communicated effectively. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait until marriage might not have been considered a problem until now, but the author is clearly affected by it. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. They didn't force the fianc\u00e9e to change her behavior. They tried to understand and respect her initial reasons. The resentment comes from a place of feeling that their expectations weren't met, which is a common issue in relationships when there's a shift in priorities or values. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, especially since the change wasn't discussed earlier. However, their resentment might be misplaced if they didn't address the topic during their dating phase. But given the circumstances as described, the fianc\u00e9e made a significant change after the engagement, which wasn't part of their original agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but they might need to work on communication and finding a solution together.\n"
