Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after they got engaged, and now the fianc\u00e9 is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The fianc\u00e9 (the author) says they had a good sex life before engagement but it decreased after. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic background and friends' influences. The author feels they didn't agree to this before marriage and is resentful now.\n\nHmm. Let's think about communication. The author respected her initial reasons and didn't push. Then, after some time, the fianc\u00e9e shared the deeper reason. The author is upset because this decision came after they were already engaged, not when they started dating. The key here is that the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement. The author feels it's a recent change affecting their dynamic. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have a right to feel upset if their expectations were different. But did they agree on premarital sex when they started dating? The story says they both didn't choose to wait and have been with others. So maybe the author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind later. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her background. The author's resentment might come from unmet expectations, but they didn't set clear boundaries beforehand. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is respecting her reasons now, which shows some maturity. However, resentment is still there. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way. It's a bit of a gray area. If they didn't agree on this before marriage, then perhaps both have a right to their feelings. The author's frustration is valid, but also, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is her choice. \n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe because the author didn't address this issue before marriage? Or because the fianc\u00e9e had the right to change her mind? Hmm. Alternatively, the author might be wrong if they didn't communicate their needs earlier. However, they did try to understand and respect her initial reasons. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had a right to expect a certain level of sexual activity in the engagement. Since they didn't set that expectation beforehand, and the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But they are also not handling it well by harboring resentment. However, the question is if they are in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after agreement to marry, maybe the author isn't at fault for being upset. But they should work on communication instead of resentment. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are wrong for not addressing this earlier. Hmm.\n"
