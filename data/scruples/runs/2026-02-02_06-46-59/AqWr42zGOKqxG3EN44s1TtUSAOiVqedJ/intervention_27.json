Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged, and now they want to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand and are feeling resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement but now wants to wait until after marriage due to her Catholic upbringing and feelings of guilt. The author is upset because this change came after they started dating, and they didn't agree to that arrangement initially. They feel like their needs aren't being met and are resentful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the change in the relationship after engagement, differing expectations about premarital sex, religious influences, and communication issues. The author is frustrated because their expectations were different, and the fianc\u00e9e's decision is causing tension.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author's feelings of resentment make them the asshole. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons for wanting to wait are personal and rooted in her beliefs. They had already been in a sexual relationship before engagement, so the shift is significant. The author respected her initial reasons (like body image) but now the real issue is her religious beliefs. \n\nThe author might not be wrong in feeling upset because relationships require mutual understanding and compromise. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also expressing her values and making a choice based on her beliefs. The author could be in the wrong if they aren't considering her perspective and aren't willing to adjust their expectations. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e changed the dynamic after they committed to each other, which could be a point of contention.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, but they might be in the wrong for not addressing this earlier or not finding a middle ground. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to change their relationship's sexual aspect after being engaged is a big deal. Since they had already been sexual before engagement, maybe the author is justified in feeling this is a recent addition they didn't agree to.\n\nBut considering that the fianc\u00e9e is making a choice based on her faith and personal values, the author should have had this conversation earlier. The fact that they only confronted her after a year suggests they might not have communicated their needs effectively. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to hold off on sex until after marriage is her right, even if it's a change from their previous arrangement. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they respected her decision and tried to find a solution together. If they're resentful and not working on it, that could be the issue. But if they're trying to communicate and are still struggling, maybe it's a mutual problem. The question is more about the author's resentment rather than their right to be upset. \n\nIn the AITA format, often the person is considered an asshole if they're not being understanding or if they're not taking the other person's perspective into account. The author's frustration is valid, but if they're not open to compromise or understanding her reasons, that could make them the asshole. However, if the fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate her intentions earlier, that's also a factor.\n\nIn this case, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't address the issue sooner and are now resenting their fianc\u00e9e for her values. They accepted her initial reasons (like body image) but are upset when the real reason comes out later. The author should have had this conversation earlier if waiting until marriage was a deal-breaker for them. Since they didn't, maybe they are in the wrong for not addressing this important aspect of the relationship before getting engaged.\n"
