Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped significantly after the engagement, leading to the author feeling upset and resentful. The fianc\u00e9 cites Catholic upbringing, body image issues, and a desire to wait until marriage after feeling she lost her virginity under less ideal circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was already engaged, and the fianc\u00e9's change in behavior started after the engagement. The author respects her reasons but is upset because it wasn't discussed before the engagement. They had a good sex life before, which dropped off after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9's explanation includes religious beliefs and personal guilt, which adds complexity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating, so the change post-engagement creates a conflict. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and rooted in her upbringing and feelings, which might be valid. However, the author's frustration stems from unmet expectations and the sudden shift in their relationship dynamic. \n\nI should also consider communication. The author tried to have conversations and respected her initial explanations but eventually had to confront her. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be within her rights, but the author's resentment is a natural response to unmet needs. However, expecting sex after the engagement without prior agreement could be seen as the author's responsibility not to assume. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that changing expectations after engagement could be a red flag. Others might say the author should have discussed expectations earlier. The Catholic background adds a layer where the fianc\u00e9's feelings of guilt are significant. The author's resentment is understandable but might be misplaced if the fianc\u00e9 is acting in good faith based on her values.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. The author's expectations weren't communicated or agreed upon before the engagement, leading to conflict. While the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal, the author's frustration is valid but perhaps stems from not addressing the issue sooner. However, the fianc\u00e9's change in behavior post-engagement without prior discussion could be seen as a shift in terms. But since both chose not to wait before, the author's current stance might not be entirely the fianc\u00e9's fault. It's a 50-50 situation, but since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, maybe the answer leans towards not the author being in the wrong because they have valid feelings. Wait, but the author didn't agree to the terms before, so maybe they are in the right to be upset. Hmm. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for expecting sex after agreeing to marriage terms. The answer could be A or B depending on perspective. But since the fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid, the author's reaction is understandable but maybe not justified. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they have valid feelings, but it's a tricky call. Alternatively, A if the author should have addressed expectations earlier. Need to decide based on the key points.\n"
