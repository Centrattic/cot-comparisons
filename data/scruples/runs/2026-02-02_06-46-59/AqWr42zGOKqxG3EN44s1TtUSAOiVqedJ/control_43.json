Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is engaged and wants to have sex, but their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9e explains it's because she wants to wait until after marriage due to her religious background and past experiences. The author feels upset and even a bit resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which wasn't discussed when they started dating. The author might feel that this sudden change affects their relationship, especially since they had a good sex life before. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in personal beliefs and family background. She's making a choice based on her values now, even if it wasn't her initial choice.\n\nThe author is upset because the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment. But is the author wrong? Well, it's about mutual respect. If the fianc\u00e9e is making a choice based on her beliefs, the author needs to respect that unless there was a prior agreement. However, the author might feel it's unfair since they didn't agree to wait until marriage. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author confronted her, which is good, but now they're both dealing with the implications. \n\nIs it the author's fault for feeling upset? Maybe not entirely. People have different needs and expectations. However, the author should consider if their expectations were clear from the start. If they wanted to continue the same level of sexual activity post-engagement, but the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind, there's a conflict. The author's resentment might be valid if they feel their needs aren't being met, but they also need to respect her decision unless it's causing harm beyond their relationship dynamic.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset, but they might need to work on finding a compromise or understanding. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The fianc\u00e9e is making a personal choice based on her values, which she explained. The author's resentment is a reaction to unmet expectations, but if they didn't agree on this when they got engaged, it's not entirely their fault. So, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where both need to communicate better.\n"
