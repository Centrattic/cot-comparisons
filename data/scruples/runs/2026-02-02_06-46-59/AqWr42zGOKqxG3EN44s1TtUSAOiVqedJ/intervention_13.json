  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is engaged, and their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after engagement. She initially blamed body image issues but later admitted to feeling guilty because of her Catholic background and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now they feel resentful. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is feeling frustrated because the dynamic changed after engagement, leading to a significant decrease in sexual activity. They might feel that the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in stance is unfair, especially since they didn't previously discuss this. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in her personal values and religious upbringing. She's dealing with guilt and body image issues, which are valid concerns.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did respect her initial reasons and gave her space, which shows consideration. But they also have needs and expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is a personal choice, and the author might not have considered her deeper reasons earlier. The key point is whether the author is being unreasonable. They're upset because the terms of their relationship changed after engagement without prior agreement. But maybe the author should have discussed their expectations about sex in the engagement period when they got engaged. If they both didn't set boundaries then, the author might be responsible for not addressing it earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e's recent revelation about her guilt and religious background is new. The author is now dealing with the consequences of her long-held beliefs resurfacing as their wedding approaches. \n\nIs resentment valid here? The author might feel that their needs are being neglected, but they also need to respect her new decision. It's a balance between mutual respect and personal needs. The question is whether the author is the asshole. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid, and the author's frustration is understandable but perhaps they should have communicated their expectations about sex in the engagement period. Since they didn't agree on this beforehand, the author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but it's not entirely their fault. However, the author could have addressed the issue earlier if the decrease in sex was affecting them. The answer might hinge on whether the author acted in bad faith or if they're simply having a conflict of needs. \n\nIn terms of AITA, if the author is respectful and trying to communicate now, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're resentful and not considering her valid reasons, perhaps they are. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to change her stance after engagement without prior discussion could be seen as a problem, but the author's reaction to it is also a factor. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since they tried to respect her reasons earlier and are now seeking understanding. However, their resentment might indicate that they didn't fully address the issue when it first became apparent. Maybe a B (No) since the situation is complex and both parties have valid points, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
