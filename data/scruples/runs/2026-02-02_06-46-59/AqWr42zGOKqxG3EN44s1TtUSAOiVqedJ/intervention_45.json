  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is engaged and upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after the engagement. Initially, the fianc\u00e9e attributed it to body image issues, but later revealed she's holding out for sex until marriage due to her Catholic background and guilt. The author feels they didn't agree to this arrangement beforehand and is now resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. The author respected her initial reasons but is now upset because the new reason (waiting until marriage) wasn't part of their original understanding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nThe author argues they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and the fianc\u00e9e only brought it up after engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in religion and personal values, which she only recently felt comfortable discussing. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations and a shift in their relationship dynamic.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, it's natural to feel frustrated if a significant change in the relationship affects you. However, the key here is communication. The author respected her reasons initially but didn't follow up when the issue persisted. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait might be a valid personal choice, but the timing and lack of prior discussion could contribute to the problem. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but they could also explore whether there's a middle ground or if this is a deal-breaker. The answer depends on whether unmet expectations alone make someone the \"asshole.\" Since the author's resentment is understandable given the circumstances, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. But the fianc\u00e9e's late revelation might also play a role. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is upset about a change in expectations that wasn't discussed upfront, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's something I'm missing.\n"
