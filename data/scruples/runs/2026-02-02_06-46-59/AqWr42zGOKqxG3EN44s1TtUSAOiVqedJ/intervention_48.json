Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset about this because they used to have sex three times a week and now it's only twice a year. They confronted her, and she explained that she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex, influenced by her Catholic background and friends. The author feels resentful because they didn't agree to that when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9 changed her stance on sex after the engagement. She had body image issues at first, but then revealed deeper reasons related to her religious upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that arrangement initially. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9 did talk about her feelings and reasons, so she tried to explain her perspective. The author respected her initial concerns about body image, which shows they were considerate. However, the sudden change in their sexual dynamic after engagement might have been unexpected for the author. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, if they both had understood from the start that they wouldn't wait until marriage, then the fianc\u00e9's change of heart could be seen as a shift in her values, possibly causing conflict. But relationships evolve, and people can change their minds about things. The author is now resentful, which is a strong emotion. \n\nBut is the author wrong for feeling that way? It's possible that the fianc\u00e9's decision is valid for her, given her background. The author might need to adjust their expectations, but resentment isn't healthy. However, the fianc\u00e9 did communicate her reasons, so maybe the author should work through this with her rather than just feeling wronged.\n\nAlternatively, if the author didn't agree to waiting until marriage, then the fianc\u00e9's change in stance could be problematic. But the author didn't say they agreed on premarital sex from the start; they just assumed they both didn't want to wait. The fianc\u00e9's decision to wait now might be causing a mismatch in their expectations, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author is upset because their expectations changed, but the fianc\u00e9 made her own decision after discussing it. The author's resentment might be valid if they feel the change was sudden and not discussed earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9 did communicate her feelings once confronted. The key is whether the author's feelings are justified or if they should adjust. Since the question is about being an asshole, it's about whether the author is unreasonable.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after the engagement without prior discussion, leading to the author's legitimate feelings of being in the dark. The author's feelings of resentment might be valid if they feel their needs aren't being met, especially since the fianc\u00e9 didn't raise this issue earlier. However, the author could also be expected to communicate their concerns more proactively. But overall, the situation is complex, and the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset about a change in their relationship's dynamic that they weren't prepared for.\n"
