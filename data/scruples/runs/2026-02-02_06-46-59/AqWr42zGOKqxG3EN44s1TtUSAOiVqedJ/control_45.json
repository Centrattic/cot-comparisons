Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is at fault. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement because of religious guilt and wanting to wait until marriage. The author feels upset and is developing resentment because this change only came up post-engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is justified in feeling upset if there was a sudden change in expectations that wasn't discussed earlier. The fianc\u00e9 had a different reason for the change, but did she communicate this before the engagement? The key point is that they both didn't choose to wait before, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't mention this until after they were engaged. The author might have expected consistency in their sexual relationship, especially since they were already in a committed engagement.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9's Catholic background and guilt might be valid, but it's a new issue that's affecting their relationship. The author isn't wrong to feel frustrated if their needs aren't being met. However, the author should also consider discussing this openly and respectfully. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 changed the terms after engagement without prior discussion, which might be a problem. The author's resentment is understandable in that context. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the fianc\u00e9 changed expectations without prior communication, leading to the author's legitimate feelings of being upset.\n"
