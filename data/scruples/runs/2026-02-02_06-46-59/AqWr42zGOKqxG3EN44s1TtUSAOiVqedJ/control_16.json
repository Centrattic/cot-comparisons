Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9e. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the couple has been engaged for a year and is getting married soon. They had a good sex life before engagement but now it's dropped. The fianc\u00e9e attributes it to body image issues, but later admits she's feeling guilty because she didn't lose her virginity as she wanted and wants to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand and now feel resentful.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nHmm. The key points here: the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which was not discussed earlier. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage initially. The fianc\u00e9e's Catholic background and her friends' expectations might be influencing her. The author is now resentful because their expectations aren't met.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong. The fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate this before, and the author is justified in feeling upset because it's a significant change affecting their relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, as they didn't agree to this change. The fianc\u00e9e's decision came after the relationship was already committed, which can create conflict. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
