I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are rude to them, and they're bringing in snacks knowing those coworkers are dieting. The author mentions that the coworkers are eating the food, which the author sees as a form of getting back at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are unethical or if it's justified. The coworkers are being rude, so the author might feel targeted. But is it right to use others' dieting efforts against them? The author is taking advantage of their willpower, which could be seen as manipulation. Even if the author is retaliating, causing someone to break their diet through temptation might not be the best way to handle workplace conflict.\n\nAlso, the author is providing snacks for the entire department, which the others appreciate. But the intention here is to specifically target those dieting coworkers. That could be seen as a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior. While the coworkers might be inconsiderate, the author's method of response could lead to a hostile work environment.\n\nWorkplace relationships should ideally be respectful regardless of personal conflicts. Using food as a weapon might not be the healthiest approach. The author could be seen as acting out of spite rather than addressing the issue directly or through appropriate channels. There's also the aspect of consent; the coworkers didn't ask for these snacks, even if others enjoy them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels they're being excluded and harassed, which is a valid concern. However, the method of response might not be the most constructive. The answer might depend on cultural or company norms, but generally, sabotaging someone's diet isn't considered acceptable, even if there's a history of rudeness.\n\nSo, considering ethical standards and workplace behavior, the author's actions are likely in the wrong because they're using manipulation and exploiting others' goals without their consent, which isn't a constructive way to handle workplace conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
