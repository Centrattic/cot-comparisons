I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author works with four women who are rude to them. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing these coworkers are dieting, and encourages them to give in. The author's coworkers are eating the food, and others in the department appreciate it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is intentionally undermining the diets of their coworkers, which could be seen as manipulative or bullying. Even if the coworkers are rude, does that justify the author's actions? Also, the author mentions that the food is available to everyone, so it's not targeted specifically, but the intent is to specifically affect those dieting. \n\nThe coworkers are eating the food, which might mean their diets are suffering. The author is exploiting their knowledge of the coworkers' habits and willpower. Even if others appreciate the snacks, the author's motivation is to get back at the coworkers for being rude. This seems like retaliation, which might not be justified. \n\nAdditionally, the author is using their own experience with dieting to manipulate the coworkers, which could be seen as a bit self-righteous or hypocritical. The author might be projecting their own struggles onto the coworkers, but that doesn't make it okay. \n\nIn terms of office dynamics, bringing in food is generally a positive thing, but the author's intent here is malicious. The key point is the intention to wreck their diets. Even if others benefit, the author's actions are harmful to specific individuals. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they are intentionally sabotaging their coworkers' efforts, which is unethical. The answer would be A for Yes.\n"
