I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author is facing some workplace issues with a group of women who are being rude. They think the women are jealous because they're younger and earn more. The author is bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the coworkers to break their diets by saying things like \"a little piece won't hurt.\" The coworkers are eating the food, and the author seems to be doing this as a form of retaliation for the rudeness they're experiencing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. The coworkers are trying to diet, and the author is intentionally undermining their efforts. Even if the author has their own reasons for being upset, is it right to target others' health goals? Also, the author is using other people in the department as collateral, since the food is available to everyone. Even if others appreciate the snacks, the action is specifically aimed at the specific group.\n\nFrom a workplace perspective, bringing food is generally acceptable, but the intent here is malicious. The author is using food as a weapon, which could be seen as bullying. The coworkers aren't the ones causing the author harm; the author is reacting to the rudeness from the group. However, the author's actions might be seen as inappropriate retaliation, especially if it's causing stress or undermining health goals. Additionally, the author is manipulating others' willpower, which is not a good strategy in a professional setting.\n\nAnother angle: the author is creating a hostile work environment, which is unprofessional. Even if the snacks are enjoyed by others, the underlying intent is to sabotage. The author might be right to feel upset, but the method of dealing with it is wrong. There are better ways to address workplace conflicts, like talking to HR or a manager, rather than engaging in sabotage.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions are unprofessional and harmful, even if the motivation comes from being treated poorly. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
