I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to mess with their coworkers' diets. These coworkers are part of a group that's been rude to the author. The author thinks that by offering them snacks like cookies and pastries, they can weaken their willpower and maybe get them to eat more, thus affecting their diets. The author mentions that the coworkers are all dieting and eating salads, but now they're taking the snacks provided.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is intentionally undermining the coworkers' efforts to diet. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it right to retaliate by messing with their health goals? Maybe the author feels targeted and is seeking some form of revenge or equalizing the situation. But is that justifiable?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also feeding the rest of the department, which seems positive. But the problem is that they're doing it with the specific intent to wreck the diets of the four women. That seems manipulative. Even if the author isn't directly forcing them to eat the snacks, they're using knowledge about willpower and cravings to tempt the coworkers. It's like a form of psychological manipulation.\n\nAlso, the coworkers might not have consented to this. The author is taking advantage of their presence in the office kitchen, which is a shared space. By placing tempting food there, the author might be affecting more than just the target coworkers, even though they mention that others are appreciative. But the main issue is the intent to sabotage the diets of the specific group.\n\nAnother angle: the author's action might be contributing to an unhealthy work environment. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's response is also unprofessional. The company might have policies about bringing food to work, but beyond that, it's about respect and workplace conduct. The author's actions could be seen as retaliatory and unkind, not just inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that one of the coworkers is the assistant to their boss and has excluded them from social functions. The author might feel they're being unfairly treated, but that doesn't necessarily justify their actions. The appropriate response would be to address the issue directly or seek HR support if necessary, not to retaliate in a way that could harm others' health goals.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if there's a motive of retaliation, the author's actions are intentionally undermining others' health efforts, which is ethically questionable. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that could be seen as inconsiderate and unprofessional. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
