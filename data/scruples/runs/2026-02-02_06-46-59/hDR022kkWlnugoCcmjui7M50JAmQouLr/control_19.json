I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets because those coworkers are allegedly being rude to them and are part of a clique. The author is doing this as a form of retaliation or maybe revenge against these coworkers who've been excluding them, like leaving them off emails for social functions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The coworkers are described as being unnecessarily rude, but the author's response is to target their dieting efforts. Is this a justified response? The author mentions that these women are trying to lose weight and he's tempting them with snacks. Now, while the author claims this is working, because the coworkers are eating the food, it's unclear if this is actually helping or hurting their goals. Also, the author is providing food to others in the department, which might be a positive aspect.\n\nBut the core issue is whether targeting someone's diet is an appropriate response to being treated poorly. Diets can be sensitive topics, and using food to undermine someone's health goals could be seen as cruel or manipulative. Even if the author is not directly forcing them to eat, they're setting up situations where it's hard to resist. The author is exploiting their knowledge of how cravings work, which could be considered underhanded. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being excluded from social functions and is dealing with a hostile work environment. They might feel justified in seeking some form of retaliation. However, using others' health goals against them isn't a typical or constructive way to handle workplace conflicts. It could also lead to worsened relationships and potential health issues if the coworkers end up undoing their dieting efforts.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the entire department as a cover, but the main target is the group of four women. Even if others appreciate the food, the intent here is to specifically target those coworkers' diets, which is a personal attack. The author's actions might be seen as a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior, which is not appropriate in a professional setting.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong. They're using food as a weapon to retaliate against coworkers' perceived slights, which isn't a healthy or professional approach. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of response is counterproductive and could harm workplace relationships further.\n"
