I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing in delicious food to the office to intentionally wreck their coworkers' diets because those coworkers are rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is dealing with a group of four women who are being unnecessarily rude. They're cliquish, and one of them excludes the author from emails. The author thinks they might be jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The author is bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing that these coworkers are on diets. They encourage them to have just a little piece, which leads to the coworkers eating more. The author also mentions that other coworkers appreciate the food.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is justified in taking this action. The author feels targeted and is retaliating by undermining the diets of those who are dieting. However, is this a fair or acceptable response? On one hand, the author is being harassed by these coworkers. On the other hand, the author is intentionally sabotaging their health goals, which could be considered unethical or mean-spirited, even if there's a history of conflict.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they know how hard it is to maintain a diet, especially with small slips leading to bigger ones. But is it right to take advantage of someone's vulnerability in that way, even if the person is being unkind? Also, the author is feeding others in the department, so maybe they're not entirely malicious, but the targeted action against specific coworkers is problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be seen as passive-aggressive. Instead of addressing the rudeness directly or seeking a more professional solution, they're using food to get back at the coworkers. This could lead to a hostile work environment. If the coworkers are indeed trying to lose weight, undermining that effort could be seen as harmful, even if the author isn't directly causing harm. It's a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nAlso, the author doesn't know for sure the reason behind the coworkers' behavior. They speculate it's jealousy but don't have concrete evidence. Acting on speculation without addressing the issue head-on might not be the best approach.\n\nIn terms of ethics, intentionally sabotaging someone's health goals, even if they're being unkind, isn't generally considered acceptable. There are better ways to handle workplace conflicts, like talking to a supervisor or HR if the behavior is affecting work. The author's method, while perhaps clever, is not professional and could be seen as vindictive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions are retaliatory and potentially harmful, even if there's a provocation. The workplace should be a respectful environment, and using food to undermine coworkers' health goals is not an appropriate response to rudeness.\n"
