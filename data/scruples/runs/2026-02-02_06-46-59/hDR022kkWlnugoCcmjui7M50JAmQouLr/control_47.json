I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The person is dealing with a group of four women who are being rude to them. They heard the women are cliquish, and one of them excludes them from emails. The author thinks the women are jealous because they're younger and make more money. \n\nSo, the author started bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, encouraging the women to indulge by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" They mention that it's been working because the women are eating the food. Also, the author is feeding 20 other coworkers, who are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author's actions are justified as revenge or if they're crossing a line. The key points are the intent to wreck diets, the underlying conflict with the coworkers, and the broader impact on the office.\n\nThe author mentions that the women started dieting together, and the author is trying to undermine that. But is it ethical to target specific coworkers' diets? Even if the author is retaliating for being treated poorly, using food as a weapon might be considered a form of harassment or bullying. The author is aware that these actions could affect the women's willpower, which could have health implications if they're trying to diet for health reasons. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing snacks for the rest of the department, which others appreciate. But the targeted approach towards the four women is different. The author is specifically encouraging them to break their diets, which could be seen as malicious. The fact that the author knows the women are on diets and is exploiting that for personal gain (retaliation) could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for the women's behavior (jealousy due to age and salary) isn't proven. They're making assumptions about the coworkers' motivations, which might not be accurate. The assistant excluding them from emails could be a different issue, but the author is using that as a justification for their actions.\n\nIn workplace ethics, targeting specific individuals' personal habits, especially health-related ones, is generally not acceptable. Even if the author is trying to even the score, the method is questionable. It's possible that the author's actions could lead to a hostile work environment or be seen as a form of retaliation, which isn't appropriate. \n\nMoreover, the author is using a subtle form of manipulation\u2014offering food and encouraging others to indulge. This could be considered a breach of professional boundaries. While sharing food in the office is common, doing so with the intent to specifically undermine certain coworkers crosses that line. \n\nSo, even though the author has a grievance, the way they're handling it is not appropriate. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions are harmful, targeted, and unprofessional.\n"
