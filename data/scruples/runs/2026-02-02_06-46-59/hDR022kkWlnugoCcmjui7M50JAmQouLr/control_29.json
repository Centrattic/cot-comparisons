I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have four coworkers who are being rude to them. The author brings in delicious food to the office and is encouraging these coworkers to eat it, knowing they're trying to diet. The goal seems to be to \"wreck their diets,\" which is a bit of a mean-spirited intention. But the author also mentions that others in the department benefit and appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions. Bringing food to the office isn't inherently wrong. It's a common practice, and many people share snacks. However, the author's motivation here is to undermine their coworkers' diets. That's where it gets tricky. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it okay to take pleasure in causing them to fail at their diets? \n\nThe coworkers are in a food environment, so if others are eating the food, maybe the author is just being a good office citizen by sharing. But the author is specifically targeting these four women, making comments like \"just a little piece won\u2019t hurt\" when they hesitate. This targeted approach with a malicious intent might be crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the coworkers are eating the food. The author might feel vindicated, thinking their plan worked, but does that justification matter? Maybe the coworkers have the right to choose their own dietary habits, even if they're part of a group trying to diet. The author isn't forcing them to eat it; they're just making it available and encouraging them. \n\nBut the core issue is the author's intention. Deliberately trying to sabotage someone's efforts, even if it's through temptation, could be seen as petty or vengeful. Even if the coworkers are part of a clique and rude, the response here is a form of passive-aggressive behavior. It's not a direct confrontation but using food as a tool for revenge, which might be considered inconsiderate or even bullying. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing with the whole department, so maybe it's a harmless way to improve morale. The others are happy with the snacks, and the author isn't making the food directly available to just the four women. But the targeted encouragement and the intention to wreck their diets might mean the author is not in the wrong because they're acting with malice. \n\nI think the key here is the intent. The author is doing something that they believe is undermining the coworkers' diets for fun or revenge, which is unkind. The act of bringing snacks is neutral, but the intention behind it is negative. Even if the coworkers end up eating the food, the author's actions are a form of teasing or mockery, which can be considered wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because intentionally sabotaging others' efforts, even in a subtle way, is not acceptable behavior in the workplace, regardless of the reason.\n"
