I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author brings in delicious food to the office to intentionally wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who have been rude to the author. The author brings snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, and encourages the dieting coworkers to indulge, leading to them eating the food. The author also mentions that other coworkers are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting. The coworkers have been rude to them, so there's a motive of retaliation here. The author is using food to undermine their diets. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the coworkers might have been unkind, but does that give the author the right to take matters into their own hands by sabotaging their diets? The author is being manipulative, knowing that even a small crack in willpower can lead to overindulgence. This could be seen as taking advantage of others' weaknesses, especially if the coworkers are trying to make healthy choices.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they are feeding the entire department, so it's not just targeting the four women. However, the author specifically mentions encouraging those four to eat, which could be seen as intent to disrupt their diets. Even if others are happy with the snacks, the author's actions toward the four women might be considered malicious, especially if it's part of a retaliation for their rudeness.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the ethics of the action. The author isn't just bringing food; they're doing so with the purpose of wrecking the coworkers' diets. That's a form of payback, which might not be the most professional or ethical approach. Even if the coworkers are inconsiderate, sabotaging their personal goals isn't a suitable response. It could also create a hostile work environment or escalate the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they're not forcing anyone to eat the food. The coworkers are choosing to eat it, so the author isn't directly harming them. However, the author is actively encouraging them to break their diets, which could be seen as manipulative. The fact that the author knows how to exploit their willpower weaknesses adds to the manipulative aspect.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the workplace. The author is providing snacks for everyone, which is a positive contribution. But the intention to target specific coworkers' diets could be seen as undermining a positive action. The coworkers on diets might feel targeted, which could lead to further tension.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's generally considered wrong to intentionally undermine someone else's goals, especially in a professional setting. The author is using food as a weapon against people they perceive as being unfair to them. Even if the coworkers are at fault for being rude, the author's response is not professional and could be considered a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong. Their actions, while perhaps not illegal, are ethically questionable and unprofessional. They are using a manipulative tactic to retaliate against coworkers, which isn't an appropriate way to handle workplace conflicts. The correct answer here is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
