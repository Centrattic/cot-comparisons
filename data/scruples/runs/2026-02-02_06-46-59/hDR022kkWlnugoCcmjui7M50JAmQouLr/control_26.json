I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in delicious food to the office to \"wreck\" their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who have been rude to the author since they started a year ago. The author thinks they're being mean because they're jealous of the author's youth and higher salary. The author's strategy involves bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, encouraging the coworkers to indulge despite their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. The author is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting, possibly to get back at them for being rude. The justification is that the author is retaliating against the coworkers' cliquish behavior and exclusion. However, the author is using the entire department's kitchen to do this, which might affect others who aren't part of the conflict. The author mentions that the rest of the department (around 20 people) also benefit from the snacks and are appreciative.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions are justified as revenge or if they cross a line. From a moral standpoint, intentionally undermining someone's health goals, even if they're dieting for their own reasons, could be seen as harmful. The author is preying on their willpower, which is a form of manipulation. Also, using the workplace setting to do this might be problematic because it's a shared space, and the author's actions could affect people who don't want to be involved in the conflict. The fact that others are happy with the snacks doesn't negate the targeted aspect. The author is being vindictive towards specific individuals, which is unprofessional and potentially unkind.\n\nAnother angle is that the coworkers were already being rude, so the author is retaliating. But retaliation in the workplace is generally discouraged. It can create a toxic environment and escalate conflicts. The author could have addressed the issue through more constructive means, like talking to HR or a manager if the exclusion was affecting work. Instead, they chose to act out in a way that's publicly undermining others' efforts, which isn't a healthy or professional response.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions knowing about dieting from personal experience, but that doesn't give them the right to sabotage others' diets. Everyone has different health goals, and respecting that is important. The author's actions could lead to embarrassment or other negative consequences for the coworkers, especially if their dieting is for health reasons like medical issues. Even if it's just a social diet, the author is still interfering in a personal choice.\n\nThe fact that the rest of the department appreciates the snacks is a bit of a red herring. It doesn't excuse targeting specific individuals. The author's actions are still focused on a specific group they have a problem with, using the shared space to do so. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that could damage workplace relationships further.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coworkers being rude is problematic, the author's method of retaliation is not appropriate. The right approach would be to address the conflict directly and professionally, not through sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
