I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in delicious food to the office to intentionally wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who have been rude to the author. The author knows they're dieting but is tempting them with snacks, saying things like \"a little piece won't hurt.\" Meanwhile, other coworkers in the department are also benefiting from the snacks.\n\nHmm. The main points to consider here are intent and the impact of the author's actions. The author's motivation is to get back at their coworkers for being rude and possibly excluding them. By bringing in unhealthy foods, they're specifically targeting these coworkers' diets, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, the author also mentions that they're feeding the rest of the department, which might make it seem like they're not entirely malicious.\n\nBut wait, is it okay to sabotage someone's diet just because they've been rude? That seems like a personal vendetta. Even if the coworkers started it by being rude, intentionally undermining their health goals crosses a line. Dieting is a personal choice, and while the author might not be forcing them to eat the food, they're making it tempting in a way that's meant to derail their efforts. The author is aware that even a small crack in willpower can lead to overeating, so they're using that knowledge to their advantage to mess with their coworkers.\n\nAlso, the department's other employees are getting snacks too, but the author's main target is the four women. This selective targeting might be the key here. The author isn't just providing snacks for everyone, but specifically trying to affect these four coworkers. Even if others benefit, the intent is to harm the relationship with those who have been rude. \n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. Sabotaging colleagues' health goals could create a hostile work environment. Even if it's not illegal, it's unprofessional. The author's actions might be seen as a form of bullying or harassment, depending on how it's perceived. The coworkers were already being rude and cliquish, but the author's response is to take it further by undermining their diets, which could be considered a form of retaliation that's not appropriate in a professional setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they're just providing snacks for everyone and not forcing anyone to eat them. But the fact that they're doing it with the specific intent to wreck the diets of those four coworkers changes the nature of the action. It's a calculated move to get back at people who have been unkind, which could be seen as justified in their eyes, but in a professional context, it's probably not the right approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions are a form of personal retaliation that affects their coworkers' health goals and contributes to a negative workplace environment. Even if others benefit, the intent to target specific individuals for being rude is problematic.\n"
