I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing in food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets because those coworkers are being rude to them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a group of four women who are being unnecessarily rude since day one. They're cliquish, one of them is keeping them off social emails. The author is younger and makes more money than one of them, so maybe there's jealousy involved. The author is bringing in treats like cookies and pastries, encouraging coworkers to indulge, knowing that these women are dieting. The goal seems to be to break their diets by tempting them with food. The author mentions that this has been working because they've seen the women take the food. Also, others in the department are appreciative.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. The author is retaliating against perceived bullying or rudeness. However, using food to undermine someone else's dieting efforts could be seen as a form of revenge or manipulation. Even if the author has a reason to be upset, is it acceptable to use others' willpower against their own goals?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for themselves against a mean group. On the other hand, the action might be considered petty or harmful. The author is affecting the diets of people who might have health goals, which could be seen as undermining their personal choices. Also, the author is making assumptions about the coworkers' motivations and health, which might not be accurate. Not everyone who diets for weight loss, and some might have medical reasons.\n\nAnother angle: the author is indirectly helping others in the department, which is a positive, but the negative action towards the four women is intentional and malicious. The key here is intent. The author's intent is to specifically target these four women's diets, which is a form of retaliation. Even if the author feels wronged, the method of retaliation is questionable. It's a form of bullying or hazing in return, which might not be justified.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the coworkers are being rude, but bringing in food is a passive-aggressive way to get back at them. It's possible that the author's actions are exacerbating the workplace conflict rather than resolving it. A more mature approach might be to address the rudeness directly, perhaps through HR or a supervisor, instead of using food as a weapon.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning about understanding dieting and willpower is a bit flawed. They assume that their own experience with weight fluctuations gives them insight into the diets of the others, but everyone's health journey is different. What works for one person might not apply to another, and the author is making a judgment about the coworkers' diets without knowing their full circumstances.\n\nIn terms of workplace behavior, sabotaging someone's health goals, even in a playful way, isn't appropriate. It could lead to a toxic work environment and might even be considered harassment. The author's actions are not only targeting the four women but also affecting the department's social dynamics, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even though the author has a valid grievance, the method they chose to address it is inappropriate. The right answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
