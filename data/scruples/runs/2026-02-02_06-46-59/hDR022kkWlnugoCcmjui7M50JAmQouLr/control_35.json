I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to wreck the diets of four coworkers who are rude to them. The coworkers are part of a clique and have been unkind since the author started a year ago. The author mentions that they're not sure why they're being treated this way but suspects jealousy due to being younger and earning more. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the coworkers to indulge, leading to them eating more. The author also notes that other coworkers appreciate the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is targeting specific coworkers with the intention of undermining their diets. While the author might feel justified due to the coworkers' rudeness, intentionally sabotaging someone's health goals is a gray area. It's one thing to share food, but doing so with the specific intent to derail diets could be seen as a form of retaliation. Even if the author's actions are a form of playful revenge, it's important to consider if it crosses into unkind or unethical behavior.\n\nThe author mentions that others in the department also benefit from the snacks, which might mitigate some of the blame. However, the key issue is the intent: the author is specifically targeting those on diets, which could be perceived as cruel or malicious, especially if the coworkers are trying to improve their health. Even if the coworkers are rude, undermining their efforts might not be the appropriate response. Healthy conflict resolution might involve addressing the rudeness directly rather than using food as a weapon.\n\nAdditionally, the author's justification that they know how dieting works and that a small indulgence can lead to giving up entirely is a valid point about willpower. However, using that knowledge to deliberately cause others to fail in their goals could be seen as manipulative. It's important to consider whether the author's actions are proportionate to the perceived wrongdoing. The coworkers being rude doesn't necessarily give the author the right to retaliate in a way that could harm their health goals.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. If the author is fostering a culture where dieting is undermined, it might affect others beyond the targeted coworkers. Even if the majority appreciate the snacks, the specific targeting of those dieting could create a hostile work environment for those individuals. The author might be creating a situation where the coworkers feel mocked or undermined, which could exacerbate existing tensions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the coworkers are part of a clique that excludes the author, the author might feel marginalized, and bringing in food could be a way to level the playing field or gain acceptance from others. However, the method of doing so by targeting the diets of those who are rude might still be problematic, as it's a form of personal attack rather than a constructive approach to improving work relations.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might stem from a place of feeling wronged, the deliberate sabotage of others' health goals, even as a form of retaliation, is likely to be seen as crossing a line. The appropriate action would be to address the rudeness directly or seek mediation rather than engaging in behavior that could be harmful to others' well-being. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, so the answer should be A.\n"
