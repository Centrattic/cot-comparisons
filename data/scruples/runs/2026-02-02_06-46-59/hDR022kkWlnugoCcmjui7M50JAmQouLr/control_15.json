I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who are being rude to them. The author feels targeted and is trying to get back at them by making it hard to stick to their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. They mention that the coworkers are being unnecessarily rude and cliquish, even excluding them from emails. The author is retaliating by tempting them with snacks, knowing that dieters can give in to cravings. But is this a reasonable response?\n\nWell, the coworkers might have valid reasons for being rude, even if the author doesn't know them. Maybe it's not about jealousy or the author being younger. It's possible there's another reason the coworkers are acting that way. The author isn't the one who is in the wrong for being rude; that's on the coworkers. But does that mean the author is justified in their retaliation?\n\nIntentionally sabotaging someone's diet seems like a personal attack. Even if the coworkers are being rude, using food to undermine their health goals isn't a professional response. The office is a shared space, and the author is affecting not just the target coworkers but others too. While others appreciate the snacks, the author is specifically targeting the four women, which could be seen as vindictive.\n\nAlso, the author is making assumptions about the coworkers' diets and their willpower. Maybe the coworkers have health reasons for dieting, and the author is hindering that. Even if the author is trying to get back at them, it's not a healthy or constructive way to handle workplace conflicts. The right approach would be to address the rude behavior through appropriate channels, not retaliate with food sabotage.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's actions are not acceptable in a professional setting.\n"
