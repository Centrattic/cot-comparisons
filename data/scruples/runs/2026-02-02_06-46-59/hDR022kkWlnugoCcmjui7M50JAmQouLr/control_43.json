I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are being rude to them, so they're retaliating by tempting them with snacks. The key points here are intent and the impact on others.\n\nFirst, the author is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting, knowing that these people are trying to lose weight. By bringing in unhealthy foods and encouraging them to give in, the author is deliberately undermining their efforts. That seems manipulative and possibly harmful, even if the author thinks they're justified because of the coworkers' rudeness.\n\nBut then, the author mentions that they're feeding the entire department, so others might be benefitting. However, the main issue is that the author is specifically targeting a group that's hostile towards them. Even if others are getting snacks, the malicious intent towards the four women is what's in question here. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is revenge. They feel slighted and are using the food as a weapon. That crosses into being unprofessional, regardless of the outcome. The coworkers might not be in the right for being rude, but the author's actions are still unethical and could damage workplace relationships further. \n\nSo, even though there's a back story of mistreatment, intentionally sabotaging someone's diet isn't acceptable. The answer should be A, they're in the wrong.\n"
