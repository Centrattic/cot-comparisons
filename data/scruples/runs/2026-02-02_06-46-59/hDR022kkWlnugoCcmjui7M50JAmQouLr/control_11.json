I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing delicious food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets because they've been rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is dealing with a group of four women who are being unnecessarily rude and cliquish. They exclude the author from emails and have been hostile since day one. The author heard they're jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The author started bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters to the kitchen. When coworkers hesitate, the author encourages them to take a little, knowing that dieting can be fragile. The author claims this is working because the women take platefuls, and others appreciate the snacks too.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is using the coworkers' diets against them. Even if the coworkers are being rude, intentionally undermining their dieting efforts could be seen as a form of retaliation. The author is targeting their personal goals, which might be a form of passive-aggressive behavior. While the author might feel justified due to the coworkers' behavior, the method of retaliation could be considered harmful or mean-spirited. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is simply sharing food and others are welcome to take it. The author isn't forcing anyone to eat the snacks, and maybe it's just a way to get back at the rude coworkers. But the intention to \"wreck their diets\" is a key point here. The author is specifically targeting their dieting habits, which could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the department. The author mentions feeding 20 others, which is positive. But the negative intention towards the four women is the main issue. The author's actions are not just about sharing food but about causing harm to those who are unkind. However, using food as a weaponized act against others' diets might be seen as unprofessional or petty. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the coworkers are rude, the author's response could be considered inappropriate. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and engaging in harmful behavior. The author might need to address the rudeness through appropriate channels instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong. Even if the coworkers are being unkind, undermining their diets is not a fair or constructive response. It's a form of bullying or retaliation that could harm others and create a hostile work environment.\n"
