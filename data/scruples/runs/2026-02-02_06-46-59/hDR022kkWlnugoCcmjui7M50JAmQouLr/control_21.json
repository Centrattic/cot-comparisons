I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author brings in tasty food to the office to undermine their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are being rude to them, and the author is trying to get back at them by tempting them with snacks, which seems to be working.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified or if they're crossing a line. The coworkers are being rude and possibly cliquish, but does that give the author the right to interfere with their personal choices, like dieting? The author mentions they're doing this to \"wreck\" the diets, which implies a deliberate sabotage. Even if the author is retaliating against the coworkers' behavior, using food as a weapon might not be appropriate.\n\nThe department has about 20 people, and others are appreciative of the snacks. So the author's actions aren't just targeting the four women but also provide benefits to others. However, the intention here is specifically to undermine those four, which is problematic. It's a form of revenge or retaliation, which isn't healthy in a workplace. Even if the coworkers are unpleasant, sabotaging their health goals isn't a professional response.\n\nAlso, dieting is a personal choice, and while others might offer support or encouragement, actively undermining someone's diet could be seen as harmful. The author is taking advantage of their knowledge about willpower and cravings to manipulate the coworkers into breaking their diets. This could lead to resentment or further conflict. The workplace should be a respectful environment, and such actions can create a toxic atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel targeted and ignored by the coworkers, which adds context. But that doesn't justify malicious intent. The right approach would be to address the rude behavior directly, perhaps through HR or a manager, rather than engaging in counterproductive behavior. The author's actions could escalate the conflict and harm their own professional reputation.\n\nSo considering all this, the author is in the wrong. They should find a more constructive way to handle the workplace conflict instead of resorting to undermining others' health decisions.\n"
