I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are supposedly being rude to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the coworkers started dieting together and ate salads. The author is bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging them to eat with phrases like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The goal seems to be undermining their diets, possibly as revenge for being excluded and treated rudely.\n\nNow, is this acceptable? Well, even if the coworkers are being rude, the author is taking a passive-aggressive approach. Intentionally sabotaging someone's diet, even as a form of retaliation, might not be the right move. It's a form of emotional manipulation or bullying, perhaps. The author is using others' food choices against them, which could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author is affecting not just the target coworkers but also feeding the rest of the department. While the other 20 people appreciate it, the author's intent towards the four women is malicious. So, the action is intentional and harmful towards specific individuals, even if others benefit.\n\nAnother angle: dieting is a personal choice. By providing tempting foods, the author is undermining someone else's personal health goals. That's respecting their autonomy? Maybe not. Even if the author has their own dieting experiences, that doesn't justify interfering with others' decisions.\n\nThe coworkers' rudeness is a valid issue, but the solution here is not to retaliate in a way that could be considered harmful. The author might be seeking revenge, which isn't necessarily the best approach. Healthy work environments encourage communication and possibly addressing the issue directly, not through sabotage.\n\nMoreover, the author is using manipulation tactics, preying on willpower issues. That's a bit manipulative. It's possible the coworkers could feel targeted or embarrassed, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the coworkers are being rude, the author's actions are a form of retaliation that could be seen as unprofessional and harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
