I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of women who are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is retaliating against coworkers who've been unkind, possibly due to jealousy because the author is younger and makes more money. The author is bringing in delicious snacks, encouraging the coworkers to indulge, knowing that even a small lapse in dieting can lead to bigger issues. The author justifies this by saying they're feeding the department and others appreciate the food.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is this right? Well, the coworkers were being rude, so the author is trying to get back at them. But is sabotaging their diet a fair response? Even if the coworkers are being mean, does the author have the right to interfere with their health goals?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others in the department benefit from the snacks. So maybe not everyone is being targeted. But the intention here is to mess with their diets, which could be seen as cruel. Even if others are happy, the targeted coworkers might feel manipulated. Plus, the author is using a specific weakness\u2014willpower\u2014to get under their coworkers' skin. That feels like a bit of a low blow, even if the coworkers were first.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being proactive and clever, using a strategy they understand from their own dieting experiences. They might feel that they're even playing the game by using the same tactics the coworkers used (cliqueishness, exclusion) against them.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, intentionally undermining someone else's health goals, even if those people were mean, seems unethical. It's a form of revenge, which can be a slippery slope. The author might be creating a toxic work environment, even if it's directed at a specific group. Also, the coworkers might have legitimate reasons for dieting for health reasons, and the author is preventing them from making their own choices.\n\nThe author's justification is that they're feeding everyone, but the targeted coworkers are being specifically encouraged to eat against their diets. So perhaps the author's actions are crossing a line, even if others are enjoying the snacks. The intention here is malicious, which makes it problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the coworkers were unkind, the author's method of retaliation is probably not acceptable. It's not addressing the root issue of the rudeness but instead focusing on a personal aspect (dieting) which could have health implications. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
