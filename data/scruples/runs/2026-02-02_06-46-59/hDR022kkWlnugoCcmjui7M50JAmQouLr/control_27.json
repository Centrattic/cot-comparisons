I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to wreck the diets of a group of four women who have been rude to them. The coworkers are dieting, eating salads, and the author is tempting them with cookies, pastries, etc., knowing that even a small indulgence can lead to giving up their diet. The author mentions that these women are part of a clique, exclude them from emails, and they suspect jealousy due to being younger and making more money. The author's justification is that they're also feeding others in the department, and people appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether their actions are justified or not. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Retaliation vs. Proportionality**: The author is retaliating against perceived bullying. The coworkers have been rude and exclusive, so the author is trying to disrupt their diets. However, is this a reasonable form of retaliation? Retaliation can often escalate conflicts. The question is whether the action is proportionate. The coworkers' behavior is unkind, but the author's response is to undermine their health goals. That could be seen as a form of bullying themselves, which isn't appropriate.\n\n2. **Health Considerations**: The author claims the women need to lose weight. But it's not ethical to assume someone needs to lose weight unless they are a medical professional. Dieting is a personal choice, and even if the coworkers are dieting for health, the author's sabotage could have negative consequences. The author is exploiting their knowledge of willpower to tempt them, which is manipulative.\n\n3. **Impact on Others**: The author mentions that other coworkers also benefit from the snacks. However, the main intent is to target the four women. Even if others appreciate the food, the primary action is aimed at undermining specific individuals. This could lead to a hostile work environment and potential backlash.\n\n4. **Workplace Etiquette**: In a professional setting, bringing food is common and usually friendly. However, doing so with the intent to sabotage someone's diet crosses a line. The office environment relies on mutual respect, and undermining colleagues' health goals isn't acceptable. The author's approach is not only unkind but also creates a toxic atmosphere.\n\n5. **Intent vs. Action**: The author's intent is to get back at the women for being rude. However, the action taken is harmful. Even if the author feels wronged, the method of retaliation is not constructive. It's important to address conflicts through communication or appropriate channels rather than through sabotage.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions are manipulative, unprofessional, and could be considered bullying. While the coworkers were rude, the response is not justified and harms the workplace environment. The author is in the wrong because they chose to retaliate in a way that affects others negatively and doesn't resolve the underlying issue.\n"
