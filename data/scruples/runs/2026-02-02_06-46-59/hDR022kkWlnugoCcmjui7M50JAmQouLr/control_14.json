I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to the author since they started the job a year ago. The author heard they're cliquish, one is the boss's assistant and leaves them off emails. The author suspects jealousy because they're younger and make more money. The author has been bringing snacks like cookies, pastries, etc., encouraging the coworkers to eat them, knowing that even a little can break their diet. The author's goal is to undermine their diets, and it seems to be working. However, the author is also feeding the rest of the department, which others appreciate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. The author is intentionally targeting specific coworkers' diets. Even if the coworkers are rude, is it okay to retaliate by undermining their health goals? The author mentions knowing about dieting, so they're aware of the challenges. But is it right to use that knowledge to sabotage others? \n\nThe coworkers have been unkind, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. The author's approach might be seen as a form of revenge, which can be problematic. While the author is also sharing with others, the specific targeting of those who are dieting could be considered manipulative. \n\nMoreover, the author's actions could lead to overeating and potential health issues for the coworkers, which might not be their intention but is a possible consequence. The author might be crossing a line by exploiting the coworkers' dietary habits, even if they feel wronged. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Ethically, even if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of retaliation could be seen as inappropriate. There might be better ways to address the rudeness, like discussing it with HR or the manager, rather than using food as a weapon. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because intentionally sabotaging others' diets, regardless of the reason, is a negative action that could harm others and isn't a constructive way to handle workplace conflicts.\n"
