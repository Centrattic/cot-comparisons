I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an office worker bringing in food to undermine their coworkers' diets because those coworkers are being rude to them. The author justifies it by saying they're feeding others and that the coworkers are being unnecessarily mean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Deliberately sabotaging others' diets by tempting them with snacks could be seen as a form of revenge or retaliation. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the method of response is questionable. The author is using food as a weapon, which might not be the best approach in a professional setting. It's possible that this behavior could create a hostile work environment or lead to more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that others in the department appreciate the food. So there's a plus side there. However, the intention behind the action is to mess with the coworkers' diets, which is a personal attack rather than a professional resolution. The author might be trying to get back at the coworkers for being excluded or mistreated, but this kind of retaliation could be seen as inappropriate, especially in the workplace.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually encourages addressing issues directly or through proper channels, not taking matters into one's own hands in a way that could be perceived as bullying. The author's actions might be fostering a negative atmosphere. Even if the coworkers are cliquish, the response is not constructive. It's possible that the author is justified in feeling upset, but the method of retaliation crosses into unethical territory.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the coworkers started dieting together and eating salads. By bringing in tempting food, the author is exploiting their willpower, which might not be fair. While the author acknowledges that willpower can be fragile, intentionally preying on that could be manipulative. It's a form of undermining their goals, which isn't professional behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the coworkers aren't being great, the author's actions are a form of personal retaliation that's not appropriate in a work setting. The right approach would be to address the rudeness through proper communication or HR, not by sabotaging their diets. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
