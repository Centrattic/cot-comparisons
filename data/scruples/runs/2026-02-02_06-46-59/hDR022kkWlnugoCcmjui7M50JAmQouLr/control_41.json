I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author, let's call them \"A,\" has a group of four coworkers who are being rude to them. These coworkers started dieting together and ate salads for lunch. A started bringing in food like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters to the office kitchen. They encourage the coworkers to eat the food by saying things like \"a little piece won't hurt,\" knowing that even a small indulgence can lead to bigger cravings. A claims this is working because they see these coworkers taking platefuls of the food. Additionally, A mentions that they're feeding around 20 other coworkers, who are appreciative.\n\nThe question is whether A is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions and the context. A's coworkers are being rude and excluding them from emails. A is retaliating by undermining their diets, possibly to get back at them for the rudeness. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, A is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting, knowing that their actions could derail their diets. This seems like a personal vendetta. Even though the rest of the department might appreciate the food, the intent here is to specifically affect these four coworkers. \n\nOn the other hand, A is providing food for the whole department, which others are enjoying. They might feel that they're being targeted unjustly and are using this method to cope with their stress or to get even. However, using someone's diet plans against them could be seen as manipulative and harmful, even if it's not physically harmful. It's more about emotional or psychological manipulation.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. A's intent is to wreck the coworkers' diets, which is a personal attack. Even if the coworkers are being rude, intentionally undermining their efforts in such a way could be considered mean-spirited. It's a form of retaliation that affects their health goals and could lead to negative consequences for them. \n\nAdditionally, the coworkers' behavior (being rude and excluding A) is problematic, but that doesn't give A the right to respond in a similarly negative way. This is a classic case of \"two wrongs make a right,\" which is generally not a valid justification. \n\nAlso, while A mentions that they're feeding the rest of the department, the main issue here is the targeted approach towards the four coworkers. The fact that others benefit from the food doesn't absolve A of the malicious intent towards the specific individuals.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that A is in the wrong because their actions are a form of revenge and could be seen as harmful, even if the coworkers are being rude. The appropriate response would be to address the rudeness through proper channels rather than retaliating in a harmful way.\n"
