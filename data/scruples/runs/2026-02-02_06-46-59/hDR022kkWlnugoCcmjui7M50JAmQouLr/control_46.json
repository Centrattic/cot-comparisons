I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an office environment where the author is bringing in food to disrupt a group of coworkers' diets. The coworkers are described as unnecessarily rude to them, and the author is retaliating by providing tempting snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting, knowing that these items might undermine their efforts. Even though they mention that others in the department appreciate the snacks, the intention is to mess with the dieting group. That's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIs it okay to sabotage others' diets? Well, diets can be a sensitive topic. People have different health goals, and while some might choose to diet for health reasons, others might not. The author's actions could be seen as a form of revenge for the rude treatment they're receiving. But is revenge a valid justification here? Maybe not. \n\nAlso, the author is being manipulative by knowing that even a small indulgence can lead to giving up on the diet. That seems a bit underhanded. It's not like the coworkers are forcing the author to bring the food; they're making a choice to take it. However, the author is encouraging them to break their diets, which could be considered unethical. \n\nAnother angle is the office environment. The author is affecting other coworkers who aren't part of the dieting group, and those others are happy with the snacks. But the main issue is the targeted group. The author is using these snacks as a way to get back at them for being rude. That could create a hostile work environment, even if it's not direct. \n\nThe coworkers being rude might have their reasons, but the author's response is to retaliate in a way that's not professional. Instead of addressing the rudeness directly or seeking a resolution, they're undermining the diets of others, which could be seen as unprofessional and possibly harmful. \n\nAlso, considering health aspects, promoting high-calorie snacks in an office where some people are trying to diet could have unintended consequences. If someone's diet is important for health reasons, disrupting it might not be the best approach. \n\nIn summary, while the author has been treated poorly, their method of retaliation is questionable. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that might not be considered acceptable in a professional setting. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
