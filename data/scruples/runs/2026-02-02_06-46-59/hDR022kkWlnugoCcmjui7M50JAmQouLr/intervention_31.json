I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets because those coworkers are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author has a group of four women who've been rude since day one. They're part of a clique, and one is excluding them from emails. The author thinks maybe the women are jealous because they're younger and earn more. To retaliate, the author brings in unhealthy food like cookies and pastries, encouraging the women to eat despite their diets. The author claims it's working because the women are eating the food. They also mention feeding the rest of the department, which others appreciate.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author is intentionally undermining the diets of their coworkers as revenge for being treated poorly. The coworkers are supposedly rude and exclusive, so the author is responding with what they think is harmless teasing. But is that justified?\n\nEthically, is it okay to interfere with someone's health goals, even if they're being mean? The author is using food as a weapon, which could be seen as harmful. Even if the coworkers are on a diet they chose, the author is actively making it harder for them. It's a form of retaliation, but is it appropriate?\n\nAlso, the author is bringing food for the whole department, so others benefit. But the intention is to specifically target the four women. The line between a joke and being mean can be thin here. The author's approach is manipulative, using knowledge about willpower and cravings against the coworkers. Even if the coworkers end up eating, it's because of the author's actions.\n\nMoreover, the author's response doesn't address the actual issue of being excluded and mistreated. Instead of confronting it directly or addressing it with HR or a manager, they're taking a passive-aggressive route. This could escalate the conflict, create a hostile work environment, and potentially harm the coworkers' health goals. It's not a constructive solution.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be seen as childish or petty. While the coworkers are in the wrong for being rude and exclusive, the author's retaliation is not a professional or mature way to handle it. It's more like a schoolyard revenge tactic, which isn't appropriate in a workplace setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers are being unnecessarily rude, so the author might feel justified. But that doesn't make the action right. The author could choose to address the issue through proper channels instead of undermining their diets. The fact that the author is making a joke out of it (\"just a little piece won't hurt\") could be seen as mocking the coworkers' efforts, which is unkind.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, bringing food is generally acceptable, but doing so with the intent to sabotage diets crosses a line. It's a form of bullying, even if it's under the guise of being friendly. The author is also putting the coworkers in a position where they might feel pressured to eat the food if they're in a social group, which could lead to discomfort or other issues.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author is in the wrong. Their actions are retaliatory and unprofessional, even if the coworkers are at fault. The appropriate response would be to address the mistreatment directly, not to undermine their health goals. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
