I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to intentionally disrupt the diets of four coworkers who are being rude to them. The coworkers are part of a clique, and the author feels targeted. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that these four women have been rude from day one, and there's a possible reason related to age and salary, but the author isn't sure. The main action here is bringing in snacks to tempt them off their diets. The author is doing this with a bit of a playful or taunting attitude, saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\"\n\nNow, the key points to evaluate are whether the author's actions are justified or if they cross into being the asshole. The coworkers are dieting, and the author is using their willpower against them, knowing that even a small indulgence can lead to giving up their diet. However, the author is also providing food for the rest of the department, which others seem to appreciate.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, intentionally undermining someone's health goals, even if they're coworkers who have been rude, might not be the right approach. Retaliation in the workplace can create a hostile environment. Even if the author feels wronged, using food as a weapon might not be the best response. It's possible that the coworkers' diets are a personal choice, and the author is interfering without considering their health goals. Additionally, the author's actions could be seen as manipulative, especially knowing the psychological aspect of willpower.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers have been rude and cliquish, which is also problematic. The author is trying to level the playing field, perhaps feeling that their own weight issues give them insight into the coworkers' struggles. But the method used is questionable.\n\nIn terms of workplace dynamics, sharing food is generally positive, but the intent here is malicious. The line between harmless sharing and intentional sabotage is crossed when the action is targeted at specific individuals and done with the purpose of harming their goals. The rest of the department benefits, but the targeted coworkers are being specifically affected. The author's actions might lead to further conflict and could damage workplace relationships. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using a manipulative tactic to retaliate against perceived slights, which can be unprofessional and harmful. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's response isn't appropriate for a professional setting. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
