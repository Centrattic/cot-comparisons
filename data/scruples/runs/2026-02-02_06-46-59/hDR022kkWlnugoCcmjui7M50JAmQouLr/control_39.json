I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets.\n\nFirst, the situation: There's a group of four women who have been rude to the author. The author is retaliating by bringing in snacks that the women are dieting to avoid. The author knows they're on diets and is tempting them, leading them to break their diet. The author also mentions that others in the department are eating the snacks and are appreciative.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent and impact. The author's intent is to \"wreck\" the coworkers' diets as an act of revenge for being rude. This seems like a form of retaliation. Even if the coworkers are being rude, that doesn't justify the author's actions. The author is intentionally undermining someone else's health goals, which could be seen as mean-spirited. \n\nAlso, the author is targeting specific individuals who are dieting, which is a personal choice. While others might enjoy the food, the main action here is directed at the four women. The author's justification is that they're feeding others, but the primary action is a targeted response to perceived slights. \n\nIn a workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism. Sabotaging someone's diet, even in retaliation, could be considered unprofessional and a form of bullying or harassment. The author's behavior could create a hostile work environment. Even if the coworkers are being cliquish or rude, the proper approach would be to address the issue directly or through appropriate channels, not to retaliate in a way that affects their personal choices like dieting.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions might not consider the health or medical reasons behind the coworkers' diets. Even if it's just for weight loss, it's their personal choice, and undermining that is interfering in their personal health decisions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are retaliatory, unprofessional, and potentially harmful. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
