I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to undermine their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are described as being rude to the author, cliquish, and possibly jealous because the author is younger and makes more money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's main motivation seems to be retaliation against the coworkers' rudeness. They're using food as a weapon to break their diets, which might be seen as a form of revenge. Even if the coworkers are being unkind, does that justify the author's actions?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that other coworkers appreciate the food, so there's a positive side. But the targeted group is being specifically targeted. Is it right to harm others, even if they've been mean, by undermining their diets? Diets are personal choices, and the author is interfering with that. While they might be helping others, they're also manipulating the situation to cause discomfort to the specific group.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is using others' lack of willpower against them. Even if they're dieting, the author is exploiting that weakness. It's a bit of a mean tactic, maybe not physically harmful, but emotionally manipulative. The coworkers might feel pressured or tempted, which could lead to guilt or frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with a hostile work environment. They might feel justified in seeking some form of retaliation. However, the appropriate way to handle conflict is usually through communication or HR, not through undermining others' personal choices. The author's actions could escalate tensions further and create a more toxic environment.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even if the coworkers started the rudeness, the author's response is inconsiderate and unethical. They're using food as a tool for revenge, which isn't a constructive way to handle the situation. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
