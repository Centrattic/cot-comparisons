I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in unhealthy food to the office specifically to undermine their coworkers' diets, because they're being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions. The author mentions that a group of four women are being unnecessarily rude to them, possibly due to being cliquish or jealousy. In response, the author brings in cookies, pastries, etc., knowing that the coworkers are on diets. They even encourage the coworkers to break their diets by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The goal seems to be to get back at them for being rude, using food as a weapon. \n\nNow, considering office etiquette and ethics. Office environments require professional conduct. While it's understandable that the author feels targeted, retaliating by undermining someone's health goals isn't appropriate. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative and potentially harmful, especially if the coworkers have health reasons for dieting. Even if the author isn't directly forcing them to eat, the intention is to weaken their willpower, which is a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. \n\nAlso, the author is feeding others in the department, which might seem positive, but the intent behind the action towards the specific coworkers is malicious. The key issue here is the deliberate targeting of individuals who are trying to manage their health. This crosses into unethical behavior because it's a personal vendetta disguised as a harmless act. \n\nMoreover, the author's justification that they're \"just giving in to cravings\" and using their own dieting experience doesn't mitigate the wrongness of the action. It's about respect and professionalism. Even if the coworkers are rude, the right approach would be to address the behavior directly or involve HR, not to take matters into one's own hands in a harmful way. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are not justifiable. They're using their coworkers' health goals against them as a form of revenge, which is unprofessional and potentially harmful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
