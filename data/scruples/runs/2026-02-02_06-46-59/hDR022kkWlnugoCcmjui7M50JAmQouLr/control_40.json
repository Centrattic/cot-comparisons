I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to the author since day one. The author heard they're cliquish and that one of them excludes the author from emails. The author brings in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, encouraging the coworkers to eat them despite their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is retaliating against perceived rudeness and exclusion. The coworkers are dieting, and the author is trying to undermine that. But the author is also providing snacks for the entire department, which others appreciate. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as a form of revenge, which is morally questionable. Even if the author has a reason, using food to intentionally sabotage someone's health goals isn't nice. Plus, the author is using their own knowledge of dieting to exploit others' willpower, which is manipulative. \n\nBut the author is doing this in response to being excluded and mistreated. That complicates things. However, the method chosen might be the problem. Instead of addressing the issue directly, the author is taking a passive-aggressive approach that affects others. Also, the author's actions could be seen as promoting unhealthy eating habits, even if others are happy to have the snacks. The main issue here is the intent to harm the coworkers' diets as revenge, which is likely unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also providing snacks for others, so there's a positive side. But the negative intent towards specific coworkers is more problematic. The author's actions might cross a line by targeting those on diets with the sole purpose of wrecking them. \n\nSo, considering the intent and the potential harm, even if the author has been mistreated, the method of retaliation is inappropriate. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
