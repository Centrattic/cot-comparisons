I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office with the intention of wrecking their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who have been rude to the author since they started a year ago. The author mentions that these coworkers are cliquish, don't include them in emails for social functions, and there's some speculation about jealousy due to age and salary. The author is targeting these women by bringing snacks that they know might undermine the coworkers' diets, using phrases like \"just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\" The author also notes that other colleagues appreciate the snacks.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the author's intent. They are deliberately targeting coworkers who are dieting, knowing that the snacks might cause them to give up on their diets. The coworkers are rude to the author, but does that justify the author's actions? \n\nEthically, even if someone has wronged you, taking revenge through undermining their personal goals (like dieting) might not be acceptable. The author is manipulating the situation by providing tempting food and encouraging the coworkers to give in, which is a form of retaliation. It's a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also providing snacks that others appreciate, which might be seen as a positive. However, the intent here is specifically to target those who are dieting, and the author is aware of this. The fact that they are doing this with a specific goal in mind (wrecking their diets) is problematic. \n\nEven if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of retaliation could be considered unprofessional. The office is a workplace, and undermining coworkers' health goals isn't appropriate. The author's actions might also be seen as fostering a negative work environment. \n\nThe fact that the author mentions they have experience with dieting and know that small cracks in willpower can lead to giving up suggests that they're using their knowledge to manipulate the situation. This makes the actions more calculated, which could be seen as malicious. \n\nAdditionally, the author is not addressing the root issue of the coworkers' rudeness directly. Instead of confronting it or seeking a resolution through appropriate channels (like talking to HR or a supervisor), they're choosing to retaliate in a way that affects the coworkers' personal choices. This could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive behavior rather than a constructive solution.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is intentionally undermining the coworkers' diets as a form of revenge for being treated poorly. While the coworkers may have contributed to the problem by being rude, the author's response is not a professional or ethical one. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
