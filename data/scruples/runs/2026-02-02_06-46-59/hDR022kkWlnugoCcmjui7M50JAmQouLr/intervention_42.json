I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in food to the office specifically to mess with coworkers who are being rude to them. The coworkers are dieting, and the author is tempting them with snacks, leading the coworkers to eat more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is retaliating against coworkers who have been rude and cliquish. The coworkers started dieting together, eating salads, and the author is bringing in treats, encouraging them to break their diets. The author's motivation seems to be revenge or getting back at them for being mean. However, they also mention that others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. The coworkers were rude first, so the author's action is a form of retaliation. But is sabotaging their diets justified? Even if the coworkers are unkind, does the author have the right to interfere with their health choices?\n\nOn one hand, the author is responding to bullying, which is not their fault. On the other hand, bringing food into the office that's tempting others to eat against their dieting plans could be seen as undermining their efforts. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior. The author is using others' willpower against them, which can be manipulative. Plus, not everyone in the office is part of the problem group, so the author is affecting others who might be trying to diet as well, even if they're not part of the rude group.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they know about dieting, so they understand the temptation. Deliberately creating situations to break someone else's willpower is underhanded. While the author might feel justified because of the coworkers' behavior, it's still a form of retaliation that harms others. The author could have addressed the issue directly, like talking to HR or a manager if it's affecting the work environment, or finding other ways to cope without undermining others' health goals.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the coworkers are at fault for being rude, the author's actions are crossing a line. It's not solving the problem but creating another issue. The author should focus on resolving the conflict in a constructive way rather than seeking revenge. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
