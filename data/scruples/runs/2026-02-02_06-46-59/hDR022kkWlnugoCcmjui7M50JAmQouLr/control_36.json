I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing food to the office to undermine coworkers' diets because those coworkers are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions that the four women in the office have been rude to them since day one. The author heard they are cliquish and one even excludes them from emails. Trusted coworkers suggest the woman might be jealous because the author is younger and earns more. The author is trying to get back at them by bringing in tempting food, knowing that dieters can crack easily. The result is that these coworkers are eating the food, which the author thinks is working. However, the rest of the department (about 20 people) are also eating the snacks and are appreciative.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives here. On one hand, the coworkers were being rude, which is not okay. The author might feel justified in seeking some form of retaliation. However, the method they chose involves undermining others' health goals. Even if the coworkers are mean, is sabotaging their diets a fair response?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone is being unkind, retaliating by manipulating their ability to make healthy choices might not be considered right. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that could be seen as taking advantage of their vulnerabilities. Plus, the author is using their own knowledge of dieting to exploit their coworkers' willpower, which can be viewed as underhanded.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the workplace environment. While the author is providing snacks for the department, which others appreciate, the targeted coworkers are being specifically targeted. This could create a hostile work environment, even if it's not overt. The author's actions might be seen as a form of bullying or harassment, which is unprofessional.\n\nHowever, the author might argue self-defense against the cliquish and rude behavior. They might feel that this is a harmless way to get even. But the problem is that it's affecting others' health goals and could lead to more conflict. Also, the author's actions, while indirect, are intentional and manipulative. \n\nIn many workplace contexts, it's expected to handle conflicts through appropriate channels rather than personal retaliation. So, even if the coworkers are at fault, the author's response might not be the right approach. The author could be advised to address the issue directly with HR or a manager instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the rest of the department is benefiting, but the targeted coworkers are being specifically targeted. This creates an uneven dynamic where some are being helped while others are being harmed. It's a form of exclusion, which might not be acceptable in a professional setting.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable in terms of wanting to respond to rudeness, are ethically questionable. They are using a method that undermines others' health goals and could be seen as retaliatory and unprofessional. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
