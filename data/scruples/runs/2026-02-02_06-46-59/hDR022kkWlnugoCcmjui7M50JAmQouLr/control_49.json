I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets. The main points are that the author has a group of coworkers who are being rude to them, and they're trying to retaliate by providing tempting snacks to undermine the coworkers' dieting efforts. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's coworkers are being intentionally exclusionary and rude, which is unfair. However, the author's response is to sabotage their diets by bringing in unhealthy snacks. That seems like a form of revenge, which could be considered unethical. Even if the coworkers are being mean, intentionally undermining their health goals could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that others in the department are eating the snacks and are appreciative, so there's a positive side. But the targeted coworkers are being deliberately targeted. The author's motivation is revenge, which is a questionable justification. Even if the coworkers are in the wrong, the author's actions might not be the right way to handle it. \n\nAdditionally, the author is using knowledge of dieting to manipulate the coworkers into breaking their diets, which feels like a personal attack. The fact that they're doing this for three weeks and seeing the coworkers eat more suggests it's working, but it's not addressing the root issue of the coworkers' rudeness. The author might be better off addressing the behavior directly, perhaps through HR or a manager, rather than resorting to sabotage.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are retaliatory and potentially harmful, even if their intention is to get back at the rude coworkers. It's a form of bullying in response to bullying, which doesn't resolve the issue and could escalate it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
