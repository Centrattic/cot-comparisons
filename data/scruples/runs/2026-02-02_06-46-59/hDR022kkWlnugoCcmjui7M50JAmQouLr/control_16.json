I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck the diets of four rude coworkers. The coworkers are part of a clique that's been unfriendly to the author since they started. The author heard the assistant to the boss is leaving them off emails for social events and thinks the coworkers might be jealous due to their age and salary. The author brings cookies, pastries, etc., and encourages the coworkers to indulge a bit, leading them to eat the snacks. They mention that others in the department also benefit from the food.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the coworker's rudeness, the author's motivation to retaliate, and the method of bringing food to undermine their diets. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being targeted by a clique, which is unfair. Retaliation can be a human reaction, especially if they feel ostracized. However, the method involves intentionally undermining others' health goals. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author is using food as a weapon, which could be seen as a form of bullying or sabotage. \n\nThe author's actions might not be malicious, but they are using others' vulnerabilities (willpower with food) to get back at them. It's a form of payback, which raises ethical questions. The author might feel justified because of the coworkers' behavior, but intentionally causing someone to fail at their diet isn't a constructive solution. It's more of a personal vendetta, which can be harmful in a workplace. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that others in the department appreciate the food, so it's not entirely negative. But the targeted action towards the four coworkers is the issue. The author's justification is that the coworkers are being rude and might be jealous, but that doesn't excuse the deliberate sabotage. \n\nIn a professional setting, workplace conflicts should be addressed through appropriate channels, not through personal retaliation. The author's actions could lead to further tension and a toxic work environment. Even if the coworkers are in the wrong for being rude, the author's response is equally problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The retaliation, though possibly understandable, is inappropriate and harmful. The author should address the workplace issues through better means, like talking to HR or a manager if the behavior is affecting their work environment.\n"
