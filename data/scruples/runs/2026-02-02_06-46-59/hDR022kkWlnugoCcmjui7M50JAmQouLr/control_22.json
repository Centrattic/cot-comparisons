I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of four women who are being rude to them. The author is retaliating by bringing in unhealthy snacks to tempt them off their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that these coworkers are being unnecessarily rude and cliquish. They were left out of emails and maybe there's jealousy involved. The author is using food as a form of revenge or payback. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help others in the department, so it's not entirely malicious. But the intention here is specifically to undermine the diets of the four women. That seems manipulative. Even if the author has their own issues with dieting, using that knowledge against others isn't fair. It's a form of sabotage, which is generally considered wrong, even if it's a petty retaliation.\n\nAlso, the author is taking advantage of their own knowledge about willpower and cravings to target these coworkers. That's a bit underhanded. While the coworkers might be rude, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line. It's not just about the food; it's about intentionally causing harm in response to being harmed. That creates a toxic work environment.\n\nBut some might argue that the author is just even-stevening things up. However, workplace retaliation isn't a good approach. The right thing would be to address the rudeness through proper channels or try to resolve the issue directly, not by undermining others' health goals. Plus, the author is affecting others in the department, even if they're not part of the problem group. The food is available to everyone, which might be a positive, but the intent is negative.\n\nIn conclusion, even though there's a backstory of being mistreated, the author's actions are manipulative and sabotage, which makes them in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
