I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets because they're being rude to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is bringing in treats like cookies and pastries, knowing these coworkers are on diets. They're doing this to get back at them for being unnecessarily rude and excluding her. She mentions that the coworkers are part of a clique, and maybe they're jealous of her younger age and higher salary. The author is trying to undermine their dieting efforts, which she's observed them doing by eating salads. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the coworkers were being rude to her, so maybe she's trying to even the score. But intentionally sabotaging their diets by tempting them with food might be crossing a line. Even if she's retaliating, is that an acceptable response?\n\nAlso, she's indirectly feeding the entire department, which others appreciate. But the issue is with targeting those specific coworkers. Is it fair to use their dieting habits against them? Maybe they have health reasons for dieting, and she's making it harder for them. Even though she's not directly forcing them to eat, she's making it tempting and possibly undermining their efforts. \n\nAnother angle: Is it ethical to use someone's willpower against them? The author claims she knows how willpower works from her own dieting experiences. But if she's using that knowledge to mess with their diets, it's manipulative. \n\nAlso, the coworkers were rude first, but does that justify the author's actions? Retaliation can sometimes be a cycle. Maybe there's a better way to handle workplace conflicts, like talking to HR or addressing the behavior directly. \n\nSo, even though the coworkers were inconsiderate, the author's method of revenge might be inappropriate. Sabotaging someone's health efforts isn't a professional or respectful response. It could lead to more tension and a toxic work environment. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because she's using manipulative tactics to retaliate against her coworkers' rudeness, which isn't a professional or healthy way to handle workplace issues.\n"
