I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to intentionally wreck her coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who have been rude to her since she started a year ago. She heard they're cliquish and one is the assistant who leaves her off emails. The author thinks they're jealous because she's younger and makes more money. She's been bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging them to eat a little piece, and it seems to be working because they take the food. Meanwhile, she's feeding the rest of the department too, and they appreciate it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The key points here are the intentional sabotage of coworkers' diets, the context of being bullied by them, and the impact on others.\n\nIntentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as a form of retaliation or revenge. Even if the coworkers were rude, using their dieting efforts as a target might be crossing a line. The author is using food as a weapon to get back at them for being mean. However, there's also the aspect that the author is being targeted by these coworkers, which complicates things. If the coworkers were indeed being unkind and exclusive, the author might feel justified in seeking some form of payback. But is this the right way to handle it?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also providing snacks for the entire department, which others appreciate. That's a positive action. But the targeting of specific coworkers for sabotage is questionable. Even if they're on diets, the author's actions are manipulating their willpower, which could be seen as unfair. Dieting is a personal choice, and while the author might be using their own knowledge of dieting to undermine them, it's still a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nThe coworkers' rudeness could be a factor here. If they were truly being hostile, the author might feel justified, but the method of retaliation is questionable. Office environments usually require maintaining professionalism, and even if someone is being rude, retaliating in a way that affects their health goals might be unprofessional. Also, the author's actions might not be directly related to the coworkers' behavior. The author is choosing to target their dieting efforts, which might not be the appropriate way to address the social issues at work.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using the company's resources (the kitchen) to host these snacks, which others enjoy. But the specific targeting of the four women's diets could be seen as a personal vendetta. Even if the author is being fed up with being excluded and rudely treated, using food to sabotage their diets might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author's actions could lead to further tension in the workplace or even health issues if the coworkers overindulge. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intent is to get back at the coworkers for their behavior, but the method is problematic. It's a form of bullying or retaliation, even if it's in response to bullying. Office relationships can be complex, but the right approach might be to address the rudeness directly, possibly through HR if it's affecting work, rather than engaging in personal sabotage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're retaliating in a harmful way rather than addressing the root issue professionally.\n"
