I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they bring in food to work to undermine their coworkers' diets because those coworkers are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using the coworkers' diets against them, which could be seen as a form of retaliation or sabotage. Even if the coworkers are being difficult, intentionally undermining their efforts to diet might not be justified. It's a form of bullying, maybe.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of the rest of the department. The author mentions that others are also eating the food and are appreciative. So, maybe their action isn't entirely negative. But the intent was specifically to target the four women. The problem is that the author's method of dealing with the hostility is passive-aggressive and manipulative. Instead of addressing the issue directly, they're using food to mess with the coworkers' willpower.\n\nAlso, the coworkers might have legitimate reasons for dieting, perhaps health-related. The author's actions could be interfering with their health goals. Even if the author thinks \"a little piece won't hurt,\" it's not their place to decide that for others. Plus, the author's motivation is revenge for being treated poorly, which is a shaky moral foundation.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were being rude and possibly exclusionary. The author might feel they're being targeted unfairly. But that doesn't excuse retaliatory actions. There are more appropriate ways to handle workplace conflicts, like talking to HR or a manager, or trying to address the issue directly with the coworkers.\n\nThe key points here are intent, the method of retaliation, and the impact. The author's intent is to sabotage, which is unethical. The method is underhanded and could be seen as a form of harassment. The impact is that it's affecting not just the target coworkers but possibly others, though some might benefit. However, the main issue is the targeted sabotage.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They should address the hostility in a more constructive way rather than resorting to undermining the coworkers' dieting efforts. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
