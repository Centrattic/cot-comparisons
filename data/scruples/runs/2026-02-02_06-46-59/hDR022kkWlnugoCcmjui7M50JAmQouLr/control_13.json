I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in unhealthy food to work specifically to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are part of a group that's been rude to the author, and the author seems to be trying to get back at them by undermining their dieting efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Is sabotaging someone's diet a valid form of retaliation for being treated poorly? Probably not. Even if the coworkers are being rude, using food to derail their diets could be seen as a form of harassment or bullying in itself. The author is intentionally trying to weaken their willpower, which is a personal goal for those coworkers. Diets are personal choices, and while the author might not agree with them, actively working against them isn't appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're feeding the rest of the department. But that doesn't necessarily justify targeting specific coworkers. The fact that others are appreciative doesn't make the action towards the targeted group right. The author is using the whole department's access to food as a means to specifically target four women, which is a bit manipulative.\n\nAnother angle: the author is retaliating for being excluded from emails and being part of a clique. However, revenge isn't a justified reason for unethical behavior. The coworkers' actions (being rude, excluding) are poor, but the author's response is also problematic. It's a cycle of negativity that doesn't resolve the underlying issues.\n\nAdditionally, the author is making assumptions about the coworkers' diets. They mention that the coworkers are \"unnecessarily rude,\" but the author might not fully understand the reasons behind their behavior. The trusted coworkers suggest jealousy, but that's just speculation. The author's action is based on these assumptions, which might not be accurate.\n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, bringing in food is generally acceptable, but doing so with the intent to sabotage others' dietary goals crosses a line. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that could lead to a hostile work environment. The author is using the shared kitchen space to target specific individuals, which isn't fair or professional.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). Their actions, while possibly a response to being treated poorly, are unethical and unprofessional. They should address the issues of rudeness and exclusion through appropriate channels rather than retaliate in a harmful way.\n"
