I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them since they started a year ago. The author heard they're cliquish and one is the assistant who leaves them off emails. The author thinks the women might be jealous because they're younger and make more money. The author has been bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the women to indulge by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The author feels it's working because the women take platefuls of the food. They also mention feeding the rest of the department, around 20 people, who are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the intention behind the actions. The author is deliberately trying to sabotage the coworkers' diets. This seems like a form of retaliation for being mistreated. But is it acceptable to get back at people by undermining their attempts to diet?\n\nThe author mentions that the women are being rude and cliquish, which is hurtful. However, the author's response is to manipulate their willpower, using their own knowledge of dieting to give in to cravings. This could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation or even mockery. Even if the author has a valid grievance about being excluded or mistreated, using food as a weapon to disrupt their diets might cross a line. It's similar to someone using another person's personal struggle against them, like targeting someone's diet to hurt them.\n\nAlso, the author is affecting other coworkers positively by providing snacks. But the negative intent is specifically towards the four women. So while the rest of the department benefits, the author's main goal is to get back at these individuals. That makes the action more about revenge than about sharing food.\n\nAnother angle is whether it's appropriate to take matters into one's own hands like this. If the workplace has issues, perhaps the better approach would be to address the behavior directly or through proper channels. Sabotaging someone's diet isn't a professional response and could be seen as unprofessional or even bullying in reverse. The author is using a method that could be considered passive-aggressive or spiteful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being proactive in dealing with the exclusion and rudeness they've faced. They might feel that traditional methods (like talking to HR or management) haven't worked or aren't feasible. But even so, the method chosen is questionable. The fact that they're using food as a tool to undermine others' health goals suggests a lack of respect for their personal choices and health. It's a form of emotional warfare that could damage professional relationships further.\n\nSo, weighing the reasons, the author's actions are retaliatory and unprofessional. They're using a personal and health-related aspect (dieting) to hurt others, which is inconsiderate and could be harmful. Even if the motive is to even the score, the method is inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
