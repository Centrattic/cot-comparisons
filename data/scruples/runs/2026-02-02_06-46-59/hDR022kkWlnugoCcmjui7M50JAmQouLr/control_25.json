I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author is dealing with a group of coworkers who are being rude to them. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing that the coworkers are on diets, and encourages them to indulge. The author is trying to get back at them for being rude and cliquish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The coworkers are being rude, so the author might feel justified in their actions. However, intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as harmful, even if it's playful. The author is using food as a tool to provoke or mess with their willpower, which might be considered manipulative or mean-spirited.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also providing snacks for the entire department, which others appreciate. But the main issue here is the intent to specifically target the dieting coworkers. Even if others are happy with the food, the author's motive is to retaliate against the rude coworkers by making it harder for them to stick to their diets. That could be seen as taking it too far.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is responding to bullying or exclusion. The coworkers left them off emails and were rude from day one. The author might feel they're fighting back against a hostile work environment. However, using food as a weapon to mess with their diets might not be the best approach. It's a form of harassment or retaliation, which isn't appropriate in a professional setting.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they know diets can be hard, but intentionally weakening someone's willpower could lead to health issues or other problems. Even if it's not direct harm, it's still interfering with someone's personal goals. The author is in a position where they could be seen as contributing to a toxic environment by using food to get back at others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coworkers' behavior is bad, the author's method of retaliation is also problematic. It's not a healthy or respectful way to handle workplace conflicts. The right approach would be to address the rudeness through appropriate channels, not by undermining someone's health goals. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
