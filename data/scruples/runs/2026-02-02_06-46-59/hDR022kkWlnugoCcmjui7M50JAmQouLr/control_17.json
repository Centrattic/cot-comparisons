I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in food to the office to tempt their coworkers who are dieting, specifically a group of four women who are hostile towards them. The author mentions that the coworkers are part of a clique, they feel excluded, and they're retaliating by undermining their diets. The author also notes that others in the department enjoy the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally trying to mess with the coworkers' diets, which is a personal goal. Even though the coworkers might have been rude, is it okay to take that out on them by sabotaging their efforts? Also, the author is using their own resources (buying the food) but placing it in a shared space. However, by encouraging others to eat, even if it's not their target, does the author have a right to do that?\n\nAnother angle is the workplace dynamics. The author feels targeted and excluded, which is a valid concern. But using food as a weapon might be considered passive-aggressive or even bullying. The coworkers' diets are their personal choice, and the author is interfering with that, which could be seen as respecting their autonomy. Plus, the author is feeding others as well, so maybe they're not entirely malicious, but the intent here is to specifically affect those four women.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The coworkers didn't agree to have their diets challenged. Even if the author is providing food, the act of tempting someone to eat against their diet is a choice the coworkers make, but the author is actively trying to influence that choice. It's a form of manipulation, even if it's not harmful in a physical sense.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue self-defense or retaliation against being mistreated. However, the appropriate response would typically be to address the mistreatment directly, not to retaliate in a way that undermines their health goals. The office is a shared space, and using it for personal vendettas isn't acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are crossing a line by intentionally targeting coworkers' health goals, even if the coworkers are rude. The author is in the wrong because they're using their position to manipulate others' decisions in a shared environment, which isn't acceptable regardless of the coworkers' behavior. The answer should be A.\n"
