I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. \n\nFirst, the key elements here. The author is bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, cheese platters, etc., and encouraging coworkers who are dieting to indulge a bit. The coworkers in question are part of a group that's been rude to the author, and there's some backstory about being excluded from emails and possible jealousy.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author is sharing food with the entire department, which is something that's often appreciated in an office setting. Many people bring in snacks as a kind gesture. However, the author is specifically targeting coworkers who are dieting, and doing so in a way that's meant to undermine their efforts. The author is aware that these coworkers are on diets and intentionally brings in tempting foods, perhaps to get back at them for being rude. That seems a bit like revenge or retaliation, which can be problematic. \n\nBut then again, the author is also feeding others, and there's a social aspect to office food. The coworkers might have started the dieting together, and the author is taking advantage of their willpower struggles. It's a bit of a power play. The author mentions knowing about dieting because their own weight fluctuates, so they have experience with the challenge. However, using that knowledge to intentionally sabotage others' efforts is a different matter. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is revenge for being treated poorly. While that's understandable, acting on it in a way that affects others' health goals could be seen as crossing a line. The coworkers might feel manipulated or that the author is being vindictive. Even if the author isn't directly causing harm, they're interfering with the coworkers' personal choices and goals. \n\nOn the other side, if the food is available to everyone and the author is just being friendly, maybe it's not their fault. But the fact that the author is specifically targeting those on diets and encouraging them to break their diets with phrases like \"a little piece won't hurt\" adds a malicious intent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because they're using the food as a form of retaliation against their coworkers, which is not a healthy or appropriate way to handle workplace conflicts.\n"
