I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're bringing in food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets because those coworkers have been rude to them. The coworkers are part of a clique that's been acting this way since the author started a year ago. The author feels like they're being excluded and thinks maybe the coworker is jealous because the author is younger and makes more money.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions are justified or not. The author is using food as a form of retaliation against the coworkers who are being rude. But bringing food into the office is a common practice, especially if it's shared with everyone, not just the target group. The author mentions that they're feeding around 20 people in the department, and others are appreciative. So, the act of bringing food itself might not be wrong. However, the intent here is to specifically undermine the diets of those four women. \n\nThe problem here is the intent. While the author might be retaliating against perceived bullying, intentionally sabotaging someone's diet could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the author is trying to even the score, it's not clear that this approach is appropriate. People have different reasons for dieting, and the author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of others' willpower, which might be considered manipulative or mean-spirited. Also, even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's response might not address the root issue and could escalate tensions. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is using food as a weapon, which could lead to a hostile work environment. Even if others appreciate the snacks, the specific targeting of the dieting coworkers for the sake of revenge might not be acceptable. The author might be right to feel upset about being excluded or mistreated, but the method of response could be problematic. It's possible that the author should have addressed the issue through more direct communication or HR if necessary, rather than resorting to undermining their coworkers' health goals. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's intention to wreck their coworkers' diets for revenge might make them in the wrong, even if the coworkers were being rude. The action, while perhaps understandable in terms of motive, isn't a constructive or ethical way to handle the situation. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
