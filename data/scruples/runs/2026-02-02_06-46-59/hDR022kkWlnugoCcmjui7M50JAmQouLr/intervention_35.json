I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing food to the office to intentionally sabotage their coworkers' diets because the coworkers are rude to them. The coworkers are part of a clique and the author feels excluded. They heard from others that the assistant might be jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The author is giving food like cookies and pastries, encouraging coworkers to break their diets, and the coworkers are now eating more of what's brought in. The author also mentions that 20 others in the department are benefiting and are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is the intent. The author is doing this \"purposely\" to wreck the coworkers' diets. Even though the coworkers are being rude, the author's action is a form of retaliation by undermining their health goals. This seems manipulative and unkind, regardless of the coworkers' behavior. The fact that others are also eating the food might not absolve the author of their specific intent to target the clique. \n\nHowever, the author might feel justified if the coworkers are being unnecessarily rude. But is it right to get revenge by encouraging others to eat more, especially if those coworkers are trying to diet? The author's reasoning is that a small crack in willpower leads to giving in, but that's their own perspective. Others might not be affected the same way. Also, the author is using food as a weapon, which could be considered a harmful action, even if it's not physically aggressive. \n\nThe department's appreciation is a positive outcome, but the author's primary motivation was to target specific coworkers. The action, while possibly benefiting others, was done with a malicious intent. The ethical question here is whether the author's response is proportionate and appropriate. Retaliation in the workplace can lead to a toxic environment, and using food to undermine someone's health goals isn't a constructive way to handle workplace conflicts. The author could have addressed the rude behavior through other means, like talking to HR or directly confronting the issue, rather than resorting to sabotage. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions are likely in the wrong. Even if the coworkers are being unkind, the method of retaliation is not acceptable and can be seen as crossing a boundary. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
