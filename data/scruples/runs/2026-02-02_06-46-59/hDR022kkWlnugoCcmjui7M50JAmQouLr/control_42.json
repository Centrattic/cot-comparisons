I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves someone bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who have been rude to the author since they started a year ago. The author thinks they're being targeted because they're younger and make more money. The author started bringing snacks like cookies and pastries to the office, encouraging the coworkers to indulge, which seems to be working as they're eating the food. The author also mentions that they're feeding the rest of the department, and others are appreciative.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if the author's actions are wrong. The main issue here is intentionally undermining someone else's diet and possibly their health goals. The author's motivation is revenge or retaliation because the coworkers have been rude and excluded them. But is that a valid reason? Also, the author is affecting other coworkers who are on the diet, even if others enjoy the snacks. \n\nEthically, is it wrong to sabotage someone's diet? If someone is trying to diet for health reasons, providing tempting food might make it harder for them. However, the author is also contributing to the office culture by providing snacks that others enjoy. The key point here is intent. The author is doing this purposefully to \"wreck\" their diets, which is a form of retaliation. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's response is to target their health goals, which could be seen as passive-aggressive or mean-spirited.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using food as a weapon in a workplace, which is a professional setting. Even if the coworkers are being difficult, the author's actions might be unprofessional. The fact that the author is feeding the entire department might not excuse their targeted behavior. Also, the author's justification that \"a little piece won't hurt\" might not consider the health goals of those dieting. It's possible that the coworkers have valid reasons for dieting, like health issues, and the author is undermining that.\n\nBut some might argue that the author is just sharing food and not forcing anyone to eat it. However, the author is actively encouraging the coworkers to indulge, which could be seen as manipulative. The question is whether the author's actions cross the line into harassment or unprofessional behavior. Since the coworkers were already being rude, the author might feel justified, but intentionally sabotaging someone's diet isn't a typical workplace response and could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions weight loss for the coworkers, but that's not the author's business. The author's interference in someone else's health choices is problematic. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of retaliation is inappropriate. The office environment should be respectful and professional, and using food to undermine colleagues' health goals is not a professional approach.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions are intentionally targeting the coworkers' diets as retaliation, which is unprofessional and inconsiderate, regardless of the coworkers' behavior.\n"
