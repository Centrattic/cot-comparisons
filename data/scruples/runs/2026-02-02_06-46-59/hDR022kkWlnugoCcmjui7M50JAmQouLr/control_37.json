I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The person is bringing in unhealthy snacks to the office with the intention of messing up their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are part of a group that's been rude to them. The person justifies it by saying they know how hard diets can be and that others seem to appreciate the food.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. The main issue is intent. The person is doing this on purpose to \"wreck\" the diets of coworkers who have been unkind. But is it right to retaliate by undermining their health goals? Even if the coworkers are rude, does that give the person the right to actively sabotage them?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent and shared spaces. The office kitchen is a communal area. The person is providing snacks that others (20 other people) enjoy. However, the specific targeting of the dieting coworkers by encouraging them to indulge could be seen as manipulative. Even if others are happy, it's possible the targeted individuals feel pressured or that their choices are being undermined.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for harm. While the snacks aren't harmful in the short term, the person is exploiting the knowledge that these coworkers are on diets. This could lead to guilt, stress, or other negative emotions for those trying to stick to their plans. Additionally, if the coworkers gain weight or feel discouraged, it could affect their morale, which isn't healthy.\n\nOn the flip side, the person is being proactive in their own defense against a hostile work environment. They might feel that their actions are a form of self-defense or a way to disrupt the clique's negativity. However, that doesn't necessarily make it right. Retaliation can escalate conflicts and create a toxic atmosphere. The office should be a place where such issues are addressed through proper channels, not personal vendettas.\n\nAlso, the justification that others appreciate the snacks doesn't absolve the person of responsibility. The fact that 20 others enjoy it doesn't mean it's acceptable to target specific individuals. The person's actions have a dual effect: benefits to some and potential harm to others. The key here is whether the intent to undermine the coworkers' diets is ethically justifiable.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the person might have a grievance with the coworkers, using food as a weapon is crossing a line. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that can hurt others and doesn't resolve the underlying issues of rudeness or exclusion. The right approach would be to address the workplace conflict through appropriate means rather than resorting to sabotage, even if it's in a humorous or indirect way.\n"
