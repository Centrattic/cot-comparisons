I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation involves four women being rude to the author since day one. The author, in response, brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing these coworkers are dieting. They even encourage them to give in a little. The author also mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. The main issue is whether it's acceptable to intentionally undermine someone's diet as retaliation for their rudeness. The author's coworkers are being specific targets, even though others benefit. The author's actions could be seen as a form of revenge, which might not be appropriate in a workplace setting. \n\nWorkplace interactions should ideally be professional, even if there's interpersonal conflict. Deliberately sabotaging someone's diet could be considered unprofessional or even bullying. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that might escalate tensions. Also, the author's justification is that the coworkers are being rude and exclusionary, but that doesn't necessarily make the retaliation acceptable. \n\nAdditionally, the author is using their knowledge of dieting to exploit the coworkers' willpower, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if the author's intention is to get back at them for being rude, the method might be crossing a line. The fact that others in the department are happy with the snacks doesn't mitigate the targeted nature of the action against the four women. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified if they perceive the coworkers as unkind. However, the right approach in a professional setting would be to address the rudeness directly or seek support from management rather than retaliate. The author's actions could lead to a hostile work environment and might not be in line with workplace policies. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is intentionally causing harm to others' goals, which is unethical. Even if the coworkers are rude, the response should not involve undermining their personal choices. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
