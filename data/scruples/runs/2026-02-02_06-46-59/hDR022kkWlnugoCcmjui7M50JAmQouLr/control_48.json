I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author bringing in unhealthy snacks to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are described as being rude to the author and forming a clique, possibly out of jealousy.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether intentionally undermining someone's dieting efforts is acceptable. Even if the author has a motive (like retaliation for being excluded or treated poorly), intentionally causing others to break their diets could be seen as a form of revenge. However, the author is also bringing in food for the entire department, which others appreciate. \n\nBut the key point is the intent. The author is specifically targeting these coworkers' diets, using their own knowledge of dieting to tempt them. This might be crossing a line from general office kindness (providing snacks) to malicious intent. Even if the coworkers are being rude, sabotaging their personal health goals isn't a justified response. The author's actions could be seen as petty and unprofessional, harming the workplace environment. So, despite the initial provocation, the method of retaliation is questionable. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
