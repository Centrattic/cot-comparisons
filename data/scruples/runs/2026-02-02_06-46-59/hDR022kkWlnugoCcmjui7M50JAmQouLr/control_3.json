I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is bringing in snacks to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets, specifically targeting four women who've been rude to them. The author mentions that these women started dieting together and eating salads, and now the author is introducing cookies, pastries, etc., to undermine their diets. They also say they're doing this for three weeks and it's working because the women are taking the food. Plus, others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are being rude and cliquish, so the author might feel targeted. However, the author's method of retaliation involves undermining their diets. Even if the coworkers are mean, does that make sabotaging their health a valid response? Probably not. The author is using others' dietary goals against them, which could be seen as manipulative or harmful, even if it's just \"a little piece.\" Also, the author is affecting not just the target coworkers but other people in the office, which might be a positive (others like the snacks) but the intent is specifically to mess with the diets of the four women. So there's a mix of positive and negative outcomes here. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if someone is being targeted, retaliating in a way that harms others' health or goals isn't acceptable. The author's actions could be considered bullying or passive-aggressive behavior. Plus, the author is taking advantage of their knowledge about dieting to exploit the coworkers' willpower. That's not a healthy way to handle conflict. The author should address the rudeness directly, maybe through HR or management, but using food to sabotage is crossing a line. So even though the author has a motivation, the action itself is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
