I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets. The author is dealing with a group of women who've been rude to them and decided to bring in unhealthy snacks to tempt them, knowing they're on diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting. While they claim it's a form of retaliation for being excluded and mistreated, is it justified? The coworkers are part of a clique that's been rude and possibly exclusionary. The author is using food as a weapon, which might be seen as manipulative or bullying.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing food with the entire department, so others might be benefiting. But the intention here is to specifically target those on diets. Even if the author is being playful (\"just a little piece won't hurt\"), it's a deliberate act to undermine their diets. That could be considered mean-spirited, even if the author is trying to even the score.\n\nAnother angle: the coworker's diets are their own choice. The author isn't forcing them to eat the food, but the act of tempting them with snacks they're avoiding is a nudge towards a decision that might go against their goals. The author's knowledge of dieting (\"tiny crack in willpower\") suggests they're exploiting a psychological weakness here.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is revenge for being treated poorly. While the coworkers were rude, does that justify the author's actions? Retaliation can sometimes backfire, and in a workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism. Even if the coworkers are problematic, the author's method of dealing with it might not be appropriate.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The coworkers didn't ask for the food to be there as a temptation. The author is in a position to influence their environment, but using that to undermine their personal goals, even if those goals are self-imposed, could be crossing a line.\n\nIn terms of company policy, sharing food is generally okay, but the author's specific intent here is to disrupt diets. If the food is available for everyone, it's a free-choice scenario. But the targeted approach and the malicious intent might make it problematic. The author could be seen as creating a hostile work environment, even if it's through food.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is intentionally using food to undermine the diets of colleagues they have a conflict with. Even though the colleagues were rude, the author's actions could be seen as vindictive and unprofessional. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
