I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The author mentions that the four women are rude and cliquish, and the author is retaliating by bringing snacks to tempt them off their diets. The question is whether this is justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been treated poorly by this group, so maybe they feel justified in getting back at them. But is it acceptable to use others' potential dietary weaknesses as a form of revenge? \n\nThe author is bringing food for everyone else in the office, which other people appreciate. However, the intention here is to specifically target the four women who are dieting. The act of encouraging others to break their diets could be seen as manipulative, even if the author is trying to even the score. \n\nAlso, there's a moral aspect. Deliberately undermining someone's health goals, even if they are making your work environment unpleasant, might not be the right approach. It's possible that this could lead to more conflict or hurt feelings. The author might be projecting their own experiences with dieting (since they mention their weight fluctuates) onto others, assuming that a small indulgence would be a big problem. But maybe the coworkers are more in control than the author thinks. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is using food as a weapon, which could be considered unprofessional. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of retaliation could be seen as inappropriate in a workplace setting. There are other ways to address the issue, like confronting the behavior or seeking support from management, rather than resorting to undermining their diets. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they're being targeted unfairly and are just taking a stand. But the key point is the intention to \"wreck\" their diets, which is a form of sabotage. So, even if the author feels wronged, the action is still a form of retaliation that could be seen as in the wrong.\n\nIn summary, while the author has reasons to be upset, the method of retaliation is likely inappropriate and unprofessional, making the answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
