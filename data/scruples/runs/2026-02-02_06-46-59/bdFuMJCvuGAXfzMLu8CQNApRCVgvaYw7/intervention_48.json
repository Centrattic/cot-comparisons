I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that she's asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a few hours so she can have alone time. The husband is hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they live in a studio apartment with no privacy, which makes sense. She values alone time and can't get it when he's home. She's working full time, and he's only working part-time. She's trying to carve out some personal time, which is understandable. People need space, especially in a small living situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is feeling like he's not welcome in his own home. He's home a lot but doesn't go out much, and when she asks him to leave, he gets hurt. He might feel like the apartment isn't his, especially since he moved into her place. The fact that he's not working as much might make him feel like he's not contributing, leading to feelings of being in the way. Also, the financial situation complicates things because they can't move to a bigger place right now.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. She's asking for alone time, which is a basic need. However, the way she's doing it might come across as dismissive of his feelings. Maybe she could communicate better or find a compromise. For example, maybe she could have alone time during specific hours while he's occupied, but he's not meeting friends often. Also, he's home alone other days, so the timing of her request might be an issue.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems emotional, which is valid because he feels rejected. But the author has a legitimate need for privacy. The problem might be more about communication and finding a solution that respects both their needs. Since they can't move yet, they need to adjust their current living situation. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, but maybe the approach could be more considerate to avoid hurting his feelings. However, the main issue is the lack of space, which is a structural problem. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
