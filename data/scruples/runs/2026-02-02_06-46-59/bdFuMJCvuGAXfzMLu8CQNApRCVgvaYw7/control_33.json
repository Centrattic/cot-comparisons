I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, let's look at the details. They live in a studio apartment, which means there's no separate rooms except maybe the bathroom. Both work, but the husband works fewer hours, so he's home more. The author wants some alone time, which makes sense. They mention that they both being home all the time means no privacy. The husband gets upset when asked to leave, feeling unwelcome. \n\nThe author says they want a couple of hours alone, not that they never want to be together. The husband is hurt and wants specific times and activities. Also, they can't move because of financial issues. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author is asking for personal space, which is a reasonable need. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or not part of the home. The problem might be communication. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, but maybe they could approach it differently. However, the husband's reaction seems over the top given that he has plenty of time alone during the week. \n\nThe key points are the author's need for alone time versus the husband's feelings of being unwelcome. The author isn't being unreasonable. The husband might need to work on how he handles the request instead of taking it personally. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
