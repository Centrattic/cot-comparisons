I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours so they can have alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author works full-time and wants some personal space, which makes sense, especially in a studio apartment where there's no separate area. They mention valuing alone time and having lived alone before. The husband works less, so he's home more, and when asked to leave, he reacts emotionally, feeling it's not his home. He also seems to struggle with finding friends to meet during the requested times.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if the husband's reaction is valid. The husband might feel neglected or like he's not a priority. However, the author's need for personal space is also a legitimate request. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the husband has a lot of free time and the author is making specific requests without demanding constant separation, it might not be the author's fault. The husband's reaction might stem from deeper issues like insecurity or not feeling included. The author is trying to balance their needs without dismissing the husband's feelings entirely. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author has a valid need, and the husband's reaction is more about his own feelings rather than the request itself being wrong.\n"
