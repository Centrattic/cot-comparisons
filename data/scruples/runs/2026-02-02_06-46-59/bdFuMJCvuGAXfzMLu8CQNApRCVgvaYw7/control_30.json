I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the context is a studio apartment, which doesn't have much space, so no alone time. The wife works full-time, while the husband works only 10-20 hours a week. The husband doesn't go out much and meets friends infrequently. The wife values her alone time and wants a few hours to herself, but when she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and uninvited. She's also planning a day trip, and he's upset if he's not home on Saturday, even though he's free on Friday and Monday.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. The wife has a valid need for personal space, which is important for mental health. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that since he's home often and his job is unstable, he's not being included. But he's not working much, so maybe he has time to do other things. However, the way he reacts (feeling unwelcome) is problematic. He might need to find other ways to occupy himself or socialize, but that's his responsibility. The wife isn't in the wrong for wanting space, especially since they can't move right now. The husband's reaction seems more about his own feelings rather than her request. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
