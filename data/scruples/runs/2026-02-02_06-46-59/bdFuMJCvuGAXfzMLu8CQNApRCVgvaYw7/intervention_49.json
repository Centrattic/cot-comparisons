I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. I need to figure out whether the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a studio apartment, which has no separate rooms. The author works full-time, and the husband works 10-20 hours a week. The husband is home a lot, not going out much, and when the author asks for some alone time, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author values alone time, which they couldn't have when living alone before. They try to plan time for herself, but the husband reacts negatively, making it about not having a relaxing weekend. They can't move to a bigger place due to financial issues.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal space and communication. The author is asking for time alone, which is a reasonable need, especially in a small living space. The husband, on the other hand, feels that when asked to leave, it's like he's not welcome. His job situation is unstable, so maybe he's home more and feels the apartment is his too. \n\nBut the author's request isn't about kicking him out all the time; just a couple of hours. It's about needing personal space. The husband's reaction seems to be taking it personally, maybe because he's not used to the apartment being shared, as he moved in two years ago. Also, he's not working much, so being home is part of his routine. The author points out that he has plenty of free time during the week, like Fridays and Mondays, but he's still upset about the weekend. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they live in a studio apartment, there's no physical space for privacy. The author's need for alone time is valid, as she used to live alone and values that. The husband's emotional response might stem from feeling that his presence is a burden or that he isn't part of the household in the way he expects. \n\nBut the author isn't asking for unreasonable time. They have a day trip planned, and the husband is upset if he can't stay home the other day. The author is trying to balance her needs without considering the husband's feelings, maybe. The husband's reaction could be due to insecurity or the apartment not feeling like his home yet. However, the author's request is about her mental health and need for space, which is important in relationships. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not entirely. She's expressing a legitimate need. However, the way the husband is reacting might be a communication issue. The author could try to explain her needs more clearly or find compromises. But the husband's response seems to be taking it as a rejection. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author's actions are reasonable. Since she's asking for a few hours, not the entire time, and given the living situation, it's understandable. The husband's feelings might not make him right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
