I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the woman wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman works full-time, and her husband works part-time. They don't have kids, so the husband spends a lot of time at home. The woman values her alone time because of the small living space. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on Saturday afternoons. But when she does ask, he gets hurt and wants specifics about how many hours and what he should do. The husband also mentions that he doesn't get a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday, even though he has free time on other days.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The woman's need for personal space is valid, especially in a small studio apartment where privacy is hard to come by. It's reasonable for her to want some time to herself. However, the way she's approaching it might be an issue. Asking her husband to leave without considering his feelings or finding a compromise could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction might be overly sensitive. He moved in two years ago but still doesn't feel it's his home. His job is unstable, which adds to his stress. If he's not meeting friends often, maybe he's struggling with social isolation. His response of feeling unwelcome is a red flag. He's taking her request as rejection of him personally rather than just needing space. That's a communication problem.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The woman's request is reasonable, but she might not be addressing his feelings adequately. The husband's reaction is about feeling rejected, which isn't fair if the request is just for some alone time. They both need to work on how they communicate their needs. The woman isn't in the wrong for wanting space, but she could approach the conversation differently to address his feelings. The husband should also consider that her need for space isn't a personal attack. Since the question is whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong, the answer would be that she isn't, but there's room for better communication. So the answer is B.\n"
