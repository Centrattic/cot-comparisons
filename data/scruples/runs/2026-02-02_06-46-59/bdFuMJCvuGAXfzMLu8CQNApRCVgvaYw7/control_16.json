I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is tight. The author works full-time, and her husband works part-time. She wants some alone time, but when she asks him to go out with friends, he feels unwelcome. The husband's job is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place yet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. In a small apartment with no kids, having alone time is reasonable. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. But the husband is taking it personally, feeling like he's not wanted at home. That's a red flag. He's not meeting friends often, so maybe he's not using the time he has alone effectively. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to stem from insecurity. If he's home all the time and not engaging with friends, maybe he's contributing to the problem. The author isn't asking for exclusivity around the house; she's just needing some space. The husband's response is emotional, not logical. He's not respecting her need for solitude, which is a basic human need. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to communicate her needs, even if it's not perfect. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that doesn't mean he can't find time to go out. The author isn't asking for a full weekend; just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction that he can't have a relaxing weekend if he's not there on Saturday is a bit extreme. He's home on Friday and Monday, so maybe he's not using that time properly.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband should be working on his own social life and not taking the author's request for space as a rejection. The author is in the right for setting boundaries. The husband needs to address his own feelings and find ways to enjoy his time alone. The author isn't the one causing the conflict; the husband's response is the issue.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in needing alone time, and the husband's reaction is the problem here.\n"
