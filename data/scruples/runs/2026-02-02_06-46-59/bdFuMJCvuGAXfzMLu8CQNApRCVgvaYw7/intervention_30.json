I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the context is a studio apartment where there's no alone time when both are home. She works full-time, he works part-time. She values alone time, which he's not really accommodating, leading to her asking him to leave. He feels hurt and doesn't understand why she can't just have alone time with him present.\n\nSo, her reasoning is that the lack of space is causing her stress. She needs personal time, which she can't get if he's around. He's taking it personally, feeling unwelcome. She's trying to clarify the hours and activities, but he's resistant. The day trip is scheduled, and he's worried about not having a relaxing weekend if she asks him to leave on Saturday. However, he's home alone other days, which she points out.\n\nFrom what I know about relationships, personal space is important. Even in a marriage, needing some time apart is normal. But the way the husband is reacting seems to indicate that he's not just upset about the time alone, but possibly feeling rejected or unappreciated. On the other hand, she's trying to communicate her needs. The problem might be that the husband isn't meeting her halfway in terms of engaging in activities that would give her the space she needs without him leaving. Maybe they need a better communication strategy, but the act of asking for alone time isn't inherently wrong. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs. Since the husband is not meeting her halfway and is making it about her not welcoming him, the fault might not be entirely on her. She's in a big city with housing issues, so moving isn't an option. She's trying to find a compromise by suggesting specific times. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
