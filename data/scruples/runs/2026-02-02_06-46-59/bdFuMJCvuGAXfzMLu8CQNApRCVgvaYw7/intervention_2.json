I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. \n\nFirst, the setup: they live in a studio apartment with no kids. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author values alone time and feels like they can't get it with him around. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome when asked to leave, even though he has time alone on other days like Friday and Monday.\n\nSo the main points here are about personal space and communication. The author is asking for some alone time, which is a valid need. But the husband is taking it personally, maybe feeling rejected or not included. The question is whether the author's request is reasonable or if they're overstepping.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they need time to themselves, which is understandable. They mention that they have a full-time job, so even though the husband works part-time, they both have busy schedules. The husband, however, seems to be struggling with the idea that the apartment isn't his home yet, which might be a deeper issue of not feeling integrated into the shared space. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems more about his feelings of exclusion rather than the request itself. The author is not asking for him to leave all the time, just a few hours on a Saturday. The fact that he has other days when he's home alone (Friday and Monday) suggests that the request isn't excessive. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by seeking alone time. Everyone needs some personal space, especially in a small living environment. The problem seems to stem from the husband's emotional response rather than the actual request. The author is trying to balance their needs with the husband's, but the husband's reaction is making it difficult. \n\nAlso, the financial situation complicates moving to a bigger place, so they have to work with what they have. The author isn't ignoring the husband's needs; they're trying to find a solution. The husband's need for social interaction is valid, but he has friends who aren't available, which is out of his control. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's request is reasonable. The husband's feelings are valid too, but he might need to work on communication or find other ways to spend time when the author isn't asking for alone time. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting some personal space; it's a common issue in close living situations. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
