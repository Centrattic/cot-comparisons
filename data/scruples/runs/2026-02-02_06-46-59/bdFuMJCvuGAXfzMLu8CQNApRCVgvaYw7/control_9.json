I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, which doesn't offer much privacy. The author works full-time, while the husband works only 10-20 hours a week. The husband doesn't go out much or meet friends often. The author wants some alone time, which they value, but the husband reacts hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's request for personal space is understandable, especially in a small living situation. Everyone needs some alone time to recharge. The husband's reaction, feeling that the home isn't his, seems problematic. He's not contributing much financially, and his limited social life might make him feel isolated. However, the author's need for time alone isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is trying to express their need without acknowledging the husband's feelings. The husband's hurt feelings might stem from a sense of not belonging in the apartment. It's possible that the author's way of asking could come across as dismissive of his needs. However, the root issue is the lack of space and the husband's insufficient social engagement. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but maybe there's a communication breakdown. The husband's reaction is more concerning because he's not addressing his own lack of social activities. The author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. The problem isn't solely the author's fault; it's a combination of factors. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering all that, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
