I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. She lives in a studio apartment with him. They don't have kids. She works full-time, he works part-time. She values alone time, which makes sense because in a studio, there's no privacy. She's trying to get a couple of hours to herself, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband seems to take it personally, maybe because he's not used to the apartment being his home yet. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for alone time is valid. In a small living space, especially a studio, having no personal space can be stressful. It's reasonable to want some time to oneself. But the husband's reaction is problematic. He's taking her request for him to leave as a rejection or feeling unwelcome. He's also not using his available time effectively, like going out or meeting friends. The author is trying to communicate her need without being hostile, but he's not meeting her halfway. \n\nThe husband's job is unstable, so maybe he's feeling insecure, which could contribute to his hurt feelings. But that doesn't excuse him not taking initiative to spend time elsewhere. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's not asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours. The husband's response is more about his own insecurities or lack of social engagement. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but from my analysis, the author is justified. The husband needs to adjust his behavior and take responsibility for his own social needs. The author isn't at fault for wanting personal time in a shared space. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
