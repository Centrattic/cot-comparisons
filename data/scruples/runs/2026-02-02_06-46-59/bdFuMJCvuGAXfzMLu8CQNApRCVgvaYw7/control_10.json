I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's appropriate for the author to ask her husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours to have alone time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which has no separate rooms, so privacy is limited. The author works full-time, while her husband works part-time (10-20 hours/week). She values her alone time, which she couldn't get with him around. She's asked him to leave on weekends to get some solitude, but he feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome. He seems to think that if she's asking for time alone, he's not part of the home. They can't move to a bigger place yet due to financial issues related to his job.\n\nSo, the key points here are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of not being included or accepted. The author's request is about having a couple of hours alone, which is a reasonable need for many people. However, the husband's reaction is about feeling unwelcome, which might stem from his own insecurities or different expectations about shared living.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting alone time is a legitimate need, especially in a small living space. The problem seems to be communication and mutual understanding. The husband's response is overly sensitive and perhaps not considering her need for space. However, the author could approach the situation with more empathy, maybe explaining her reasons more clearly and ensuring he knows her request isn't about rejecting his presence but needing personal time. But the core issue is that the author isn't doing anything wrong by asserting her need for alone time. It's about balancing both partners' needs. Since the husband's job situation is unstable and they can't move, the author isn't at fault for seeking a solution that works for her mental health and well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
