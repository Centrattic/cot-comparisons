I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the husband works part-time and the wife wants alone time by asking him to leave for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife wants some personal space because they're in a studio, which is a small living area. She's working full-time, and he's working part-time. He spends a lot of time at home, which she finds limiting her alone time. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The wife is conflicted because she wants her space but doesn't want to make him feel that way.\n\nSo, the key points are: the need for personal space vs. the husband's feelings of being excluded. The wife isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. The husband's reaction is emotional, feeling it's about him not being welcome. The wife's reasoning is that he's home a lot anyway and has other days free, like Friday and Monday. The husband's job is unstable, which complicates moving to a bigger place.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship advice, it's common for couples to need personal space. The wife isn't being unreasonable by asking for some time alone. It's part of maintaining individuality in a relationship. The husband's reaction seems more about his feelings of insecurity or not feeling part of the home. The fact that they can't move is a financial issue, not the wife's fault.\n\nThe husband's problem with the timing\u2014Sunday trip and Saturday being requested\u2014might be his way of feeling like he has no relaxing days. But the wife's request is minimal. It's about balance. The wife isn't wrong for wanting her space. The husband's feelings are valid, but he might need to adjust his expectations or find ways to manage the time without feeling rejected. The wife is not the one at fault here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
