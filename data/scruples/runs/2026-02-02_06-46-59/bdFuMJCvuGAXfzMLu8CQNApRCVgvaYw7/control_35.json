I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author lives in a studio apartment with their husband. They mention that there's no alone time when both are home. The husband works part-time, so he's around a lot. The author values alone time and sometimes asks him to leave so they can have some space. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author is frustrated because he doesn't go out much and they can't move to a bigger place yet due to financial issues.\n\nHmm, studio apartments are small, so sharing the same space all the time can be tough. The author is working full-time, so they both have busy schedules but end up in the same small space. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling rejected, maybe? He interprets her request as him not being welcome. But the author just wants personal time, which is a basic need. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that his needs aren't being considered. If he's home a lot because of his job, maybe he's also trying to adjust to living together. However, the author has valid reasons. They both need personal space, and the situation is temporary until they can move. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's asking for her space, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't mean her request is wrong. The problem might be how the request is made or a lack of communication about their different needs. But the core issue is about needing alone time in a shared space. Since the husband has plenty of free time and the author's need is justified, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The husband needs to work on his feelings of unworthiness and find ways to occupy himself, maybe. So the answer should be B.\n"
