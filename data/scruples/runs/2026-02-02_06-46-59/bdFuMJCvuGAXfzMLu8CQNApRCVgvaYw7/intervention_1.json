I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment, and the author wants some alone time by asking her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author values alone time because of the studio's layout and their work schedules. The husband works less, so he's home more, and when she asks him to leave, he feels it's not fair, especially if he has the time but no friends to meet. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal space needs versus the husband's feelings of being excluded. The author's request is understandable given the living situation, but the way the husband reacts might be problematic. However, the author's method of asking could be an issue. Instead of just asking him to leave, maybe discussing boundaries or finding a middle ground would help. But the husband's reaction of feeling unwelcome is also concerning.\n\nThe author is not wrong to seek personal space, which is a common human need. The husband's response is more about feeling rejected rather than the request itself. The problem might be communication. The author might need to express her needs without making him feel like he's not part of the home. However, the husband also needs to address his own feelings and maybe find ways to occupy himself without taking it personally.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, I think it's not entirely her fault. She's trying to manage her own needs in a tight living situation. The husband's insecurity about not feeling welcome might stem from deeper issues, like feeling like an outsider in his own home. The author's request is reasonable, but the conflict arises from how it's communicated and the husband's emotional response. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the understanding that both sides need to work on communication and mutual understanding.\n"
