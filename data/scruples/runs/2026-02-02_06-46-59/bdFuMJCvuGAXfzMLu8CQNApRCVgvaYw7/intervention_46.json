I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author lives in a studio apartment with their husband. They mention that there's no alone time when both are home, which makes sense because a studio is a small space. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot, and he doesn't go out much to see friends. The author wants some alone time, so they ask him to leave for a few hours on a Saturday. But when they do, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author also points out that he's home alone on other days like Friday and Monday, so why the problem on Saturday?\n\nThe author is trying to balance their need for personal space with their husband's feelings. They explain that their request isn't about excluding him but about needing some solitude. The husband's reaction is emotional, feeling like the apartment isn't his. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. They also mention that moving to a bigger place isn't feasible right now due to financial issues from his unstable job and the city's high housing costs.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has valid needs for personal time, which is important for mental health. The husband's emotional response is valid too, as feeling unwelcome in one's home is a big issue. However, the husband has other days when he's home alone and doesn't seem to mind. The problem arises when the author asks for a specific time. Maybe the husband feels rejected or that his presence is a burden. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting a boundary for their well-being. The husband's reaction might stem from insecurity or not feeling settled in the apartment yet.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're asking for a reasonable amount of time alone, which is a basic need. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of exclusion and maybe unmet social needs. The author isn't denying him access to the home; it's just temporary. The husband's job situation might contribute to his restlessness. The author is trying to communicate their needs clearly, which is important in a relationship. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to personal space, and the husband needs to address his feelings independently, maybe by finding other activities or friends to do on those days.\n"
