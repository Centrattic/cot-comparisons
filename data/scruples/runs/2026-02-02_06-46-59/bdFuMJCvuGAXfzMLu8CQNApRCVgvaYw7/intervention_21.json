I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment where both live, and the husband works only 10-20 hours a week. The author values alone time, which is hard to get in a studio. She's asked him to leave so she can have some space, but he feels hurt and unwelcome. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for alone time, especially since the husband is home a lot. Studio apartments are small, so no privacy is a real issue. She's not asking for much, just a couple hours. But the husband's reaction is emotional, feeling that he's not welcome. Maybe he's sensitive because moving in is a big step, and he's still adjusting. Also, his job is unstable, which might affect his self-esteem or how he perceives his role in the relationship. \n\nBut the husband's response seems a bit over the top. He's home a lot, and the author isn't asking for constant separation, just some time. The fact that he wants specific hours and tasks when he's out might indicate he's using the request as a way to vent about other issues, like feeling insecure about his role in the relationship or financial stress. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable. She's trying to communicate her needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. The husband should be able to understand that she needs personal space, especially given the living situation. However, the way he reacts is hurtful and doesn't address the real issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her need for alone time, which is a reasonable request. The problem lies in the husband's reaction and inability to handle the request without feeling rejected. The key here is communication. Maybe they need to find a compromise, but the author's initial request is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
