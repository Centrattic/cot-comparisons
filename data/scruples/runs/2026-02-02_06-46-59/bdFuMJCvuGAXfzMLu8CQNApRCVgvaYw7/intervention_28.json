I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is super small, so no alone time. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The user wants some alone time, but when they ask him to go out or meet friends, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user thinks their husband should have enough free time, like on Friday and Monday, but he's not using that to go out. They also can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nHmm. So the user wants some personal space, which is totally valid. People need time alone to recharge. But the husband is taking it as a rejection or feeling unwelcome. Maybe he's not used to being in a shared space all the time, especially if he moved in recently. The user mentions he doesn't go out much or meet friends, so maybe he's not building a social life outside. But is the user wrong for asking for alone time? They're not being mean, just setting a boundary. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top if he has other days to be alone. But maybe he feels neglected or that the user is prioritizing her needs over his.\n\nWait, the user says they both being home all the time makes it hard for her to have alone time. She's working full-time, so she's probably stressed. It's a valid need. The husband's job is unstable, so maybe he's anxious about his situation, leading to feeling hurt when she asks for time. But is that a good excuse? The user isn't asking for the weekend; just a few hours on Saturday. The husband is home on Friday and Monday, but he's not using that time to go out. Maybe he's resistant to change or not used to being in a relationship where space is needed.\n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time. It's a common need in relationships. The problem might be the husband's response. If he's not using other days to be out, maybe he needs to adjust. The user isn't being unreasonable. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
