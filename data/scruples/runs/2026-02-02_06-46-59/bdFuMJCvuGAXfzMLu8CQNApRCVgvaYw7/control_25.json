I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author works full-time, the husband works part-time. The husband is home a lot, doesn't go out much, and when the author asks for some time alone, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author wants a few hours of alone time on a Saturday, which the husband resents because he feels it's taking away his weekend.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they value alone time, which they couldn't get in a shared space. The husband, on the other hand, feels like his home isn't welcoming when he's asked to leave. They can't move to a bigger place due to financial instability. \n\nSo, who's right? The author has a valid need for personal space, which is important for mental health and well-being. However, the husband's feelings of being unwelcome or not having a say in the household dynamics might also be valid. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author is asking for a reasonable amount of time alone, which is not unreasonable given their living situation. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling that his presence is an inconvenience, which he might perceive as him not being valued. \n\nBut the author isn't refusing him to be in the apartment when they're not together. They're just seeking some personal time, which is a basic need. The husband's response seems more about how his feelings are hurt rather than the actual request being unreasonable. The fact that the husband has plenty of free time otherwise suggests that the request is feasible. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. It's a shared space, but both should have the right to personal time. The issue might be more about how the husband is reacting rather than the request itself. So, the answer is B.\n"
