I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, they live in a studio apartment, which means no separate rooms. The husband works part-time, around 10-20 hours a week, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time, which makes sense because they value that. But when she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also questions how many hours she needs and what he should do when his friends aren't available. \n\nThe author mentions they can't move to a bigger place right now because of the husband's unstable job and high city rents. They're planning to move if his situation improves. The problem seems to be about balancing personal space and the husband's feelings. \n\nThe key points are: the author's need for alone time is valid, but the husband's reaction might stem from feeling like the apartment isn't his. He might feel that being asked to leave undermines his place in the home. The author might not realize the emotional impact of her request, even if it's reasonable. \n\nOn one hand, everyone deserves alone time. On the other, the husband's feelings about not feeling welcome are important. The author isn't wrong for needing space, but maybe the way she's communicating it or the husband's sensitivity is an issue. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because asking for alone time is reasonable, especially in a situation like a studio apartment where space is limited. The husband's reaction seems more about his feelings of not belonging rather than the request itself. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
