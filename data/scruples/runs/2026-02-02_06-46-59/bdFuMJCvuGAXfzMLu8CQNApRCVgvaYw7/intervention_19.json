I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is a studio apartment where both live, and the husband works fewer hours, so he's often at home. The author wants alone time, which the husband is taking personally, feeling unwelcome. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both perspectives. The author is asking for alone time, which is a common need for many people. Studio apartments can be challenging because of the lack of privacy. The author mentions that she works full-time and the husband works part-time, so maybe his presence at home is more frequent. The husband's reaction is emotional, feeling that he's not welcome in his own home. He's also suggesting that the author should specify exact hours and activities, which might indicate some insecurity or resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move due to financial constraints. Maybe he's feeling isolated because he's home a lot and not spending time with friends. The author's need for alone time is valid, but the way the husband is reacting could be a communication issue. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by asking for time alone, which is a basic need, or if the husband is overreacting.\n\nThe author isn't asking to be alone all the time, just a couple of hours on weekends. The husband's response seems to be taking it as a rejection, which might be his own insecurities rather than the request being inherently wrong. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The problem might stem from their communication rather than the action itself. The husband might need to find his own way to handle alone time, but the author's request is reasonable. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
