I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a studio apartment where the author and her husband live. She works full time, and he works only 10-20 hours a week. She wants some alone time on weekends, but when she asks him to leave for a couple of hours, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author is asking if she's the a**hole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. A studio apartment is small, so it's understandable that the author wants alone time. But her husband works less, so he's home more. She mentions he doesn't go out often or meet friends, which might mean he's not getting enough social interaction or personal space. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling like he's not part of the home, maybe needing validation that the space is shared. \n\nThe author's request is for a few hours alone, which is a reasonable need. However, the husband's response of feeling hurt and needing exact details about how long and what he should do might indicate that he's not comfortable with the idea. Maybe he feels unappreciated or like his presence is a burden. But the author's perspective is about valuing privacy and the inability to get it in a studio apartment. \n\nAlso, the husband's job instability and their inability to move due to financial reasons might play a role. The author might be trying to make the best of a difficult situation, but her husband might feel like he's being asked to sacrifice more than he's willing. \n\nIt's important to note that both partners have needs for personal space. The author's need for alone time isn't inherently wrong, but the way she's approaching it might be. If she's making it conditional on him meeting friends, that could be an issue if he's not interested in socializing. Maybe she should find alternative ways for him to leave without involving friends. \n\nThe husband's reaction of feeling unwelcome is a valid emotional response, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. It's a communication issue rather than a right or wrong scenario. The author isn't being malicious, just trying to have some time to herself. The husband's need for reassurance about his role in the home is also a valid concern. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for couples to have different needs. The key is compromise and understanding. Since the author is working and the husband has less work, maybe the husband could use some of his free time to go out for himself, not just for her. But she's also not happy with the lack of alone time. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she has a legitimate need for privacy. However, the situation is a two-way problem. The husband's feelings are important too, so maybe the author could approach the conversation differently, focusing on her needs rather than making it about his actions. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not just if there's room for improvement. \n\nSince the husband is the one who moved in and the apartment is in the author's name, maybe he's struggling with the adjustment. The author isn't making him leave all the time, just a couple of hours on specific days. The husband's resistance seems to go beyond the actual request. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Both have valid needs, and the main issue is communication and finding a middle ground. The husband's hurt feelings don't make her request unreasonable.\n"
