I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment. The wife wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours, but he gets upset, feeling unwelcome. They can't move to a bigger place due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking if she's at fault. Her reason is that she values alone time, which is a common need. Studio apartments are small, so no privacy is a real issue. She works full-time, and he works part-time. He's home a lot, which might lead to feeling crowded. She's not trying to push him out all the time, just a few hours on Saturday afternoons. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction is that he feels unwelcome. He's not working much, maybe feeling isolated. When she asks him to leave, he might feel like she's rejecting him or not valuing his presence. He also points out that he's home alone on other days, but maybe he's not getting the social interaction he needs. His job is unstable, adding stress.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual needs. The wife is expressing her need for alone time, which is valid. However, the husband's emotional response suggests he might feel that his needs aren't being considered. The question is whether her request is unreasonable. Since she's not asking for a long time and there are other days when he's home alone, maybe her request is reasonable. But the husband's feelings of being unwelcome could indicate a deeper issue in their communication or how they're addressing each other's needs.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving to a bigger place, so they have to work with what they have. The wife's approach might need to be more considerate of his feelings. Perhaps she could frame the request as wanting time to herself but also considering his options, like suggesting activities he could do if he wants to meet friends. Alternatively, they might find a compromise, like specific times when she needs space and other times when he can have more presence.\n\nIn terms of fault, the wife isn't necessarily wrong for needing alone time. However, the way she's handling the request\u2014maybe not considering his emotional response\u2014could be part of the problem. The husband's reaction is also valid if he feels his needs for connection and being part of the home aren't met. The problem seems to stem from unmet expectations and possibly poor communication rather than one person being entirely at fault.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because having personal space needs is normal, but there's room for improving communication. However, the situation is nuanced, and both parties might have valid points without either being completely wrong.\n"
