I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, which means they don't have separate rooms. The husband works only 10-20 hours a week and spends a lot of time at home. The author wants some alone time, which is understandable. They mention that when they ask him to go out, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband seems to take it personally, wanting specific hours and activities outlined.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they value alone time, especially since they work full-time. The husband's job is unstable, making moving to a bigger place difficult. The key points here are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of not being welcome. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable, like constant separation, just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction seems more about how it's framed rather than the request itself. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, everyone needs personal space, and the author is communicating their needs. The issue might be in how the request is made or the husband's sensitivity. The husband's response\u2014feeling unwelcome and needing specifics\u2014suggests he might be overreacting. The author isn't being selfish; they're seeking balance. So the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
