I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife values her alone time and has a valid reason since they live in a studio with no privacy. She works full-time while he works part-time. She's not avoiding him but just needs space. On the other hand, the husband feels he doesn't have a home and gets hurt when asked to leave. He might be feeling neglected or not included.\n\nBut wait, the key points here are that they live in a studio, which inherently has limited space. The husband has a lot of free time, as he works only 10-20 hours a week. The wife is trying to balance her need for personal time without causing conflict. The husband's reaction seems a bit extreme. He has days when he's home alone, like Friday and Monday, so maybe he could use that time to socialize. Also, the wife is asking for specific hours, which is reasonable. The husband's issue is more about feeling unwelcome, but the wife is just seeking alone time, which is a normal need.\n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, which adds stress, but that doesn't justify his reaction. The wife isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The fact that they can't move to a bigger place yet is out of their control. The wife's actions are about self-care and maintaining her well-being. So, the wife isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
