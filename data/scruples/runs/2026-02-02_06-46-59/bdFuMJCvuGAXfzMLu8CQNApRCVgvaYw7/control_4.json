I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the context is a studio apartment, which means limited space and no privacy. The author works full-time, while her husband works only 10-20 hours a week, so he's home a lot. She values alone time and sometimes asks him to leave so she can have some space. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially given the living situation. It's common for people to require some alone time to recharge. On the other hand, the husband's reaction seems hurtful\u2014feeling that the home isn't his and being upset about not having a relaxing weekend. He might be feeling neglected or unappreciated, especially since he's not working as much and might be struggling with his role or self-worth.\n\nBut the key point is whether asking for time alone is unreasonable. In a committed relationship, both partners should have the right to some privacy. The husband's job situation and social habits (not going out much) might contribute to his discomfort. However, the author isn't asking for excessive time; just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction of feeling unwelcome and needing specific hours might be overreacting. \n\nThe fact that he was home alone all day Friday and might have Monday off suggests he does have time, but maybe he's not using it to engage in activities. That could indicate a personal issue with boredom or loneliness rather than the author's request being unfair. \n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving, so the author isn't at fault there. The husband might need to find hobbies or friends to spend time with, but the author's request for personal space isn't unreasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
