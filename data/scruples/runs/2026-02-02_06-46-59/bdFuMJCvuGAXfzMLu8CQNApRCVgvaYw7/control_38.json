I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome. They can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The wife values her alone time because they live in a small space without much privacy. She works full-time, and he works fewer hours. She's not avoiding him but just needs some personal space. The husband feels like he's not wanted in his own home when she asks for time alone. He also points out that he's home a lot already and doesn't have much else to do. But he's not meeting friends much, which might be a problem.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The wife is asking for her needs, which are valid. It's common for people to need personal space, especially in shared living situations. However, the husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unappreciated or not having a place in the home. Maybe he feels like his presence is a burden or that he's not part of the household in a way that makes him comfortable.\n\nThe user is asking if the wife is in the wrong. I don't think she is. She's expressing a need that's reasonable. The problem might be more about how the request is communicated or the husband's emotional response. The husband's feelings are valid too; he might feel rejected when asked to leave. But the core issue is mutual understanding and finding a middle ground. The wife isn't being unreasonable by asking for a few hours to herself, especially since they live in a studio and have no other space. The husband's issue might be about feeling insecure about his role or not having enough social interaction, which could be a separate issue they need to address together.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving to a bigger apartment, so they need to work on their current living situation. The wife isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but both could benefit from discussing their feelings more openly and finding solutions that respect both their needs. Maybe the husband could find other activities or hobbies to do alone, and the wife could set specific times for alone time to avoid unexpected requests. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
