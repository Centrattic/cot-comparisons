I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment where both live, and the husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The main issue is the wife wanting some alone time, which the husband takes as a rejection, feeling unwelcome in his own home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife values her alone time and the husband feels hurt when she asks him to leave. She mentions that they don't have kids and the husband has a lot of free time. The husband's job is unstable, making it hard to move to a bigger place. \n\nThe wife is asking for a couple of hours of alone time, which is reasonable. People need personal space, especially in a small living situation like a studio. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling that his home isn't welcoming, but he does have a significant amount of free time each week. The key here is whether her request is unreasonable. Since there's no mention of him needing to be home for work or other commitments during those hours, it's hard to see why he can't find something to do. \n\nAlso, the fact that they can't move to a bigger apartment due to financial issues means they have to live with the current situation. The husband's emotional response might be more about feeling unappreciated or not being able to meet his social needs, which the wife is also trying to address by suggesting he meet friends. However, he's not taking that initiative, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe wife isn't asking for the entire weekend; just a couple of hours on Saturday. The husband's problem with not being able to relax on the weekend might be his own adjustment to the living situation. The wife is trying to balance her need for alone time with the husband's presence. Since the husband has the time and the request is specific and short, the wife's action seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
