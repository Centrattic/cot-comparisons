I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author asking their husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours to have some alone time. The husband is upset and feels unwelcome, even though he's home a lot and the author is working full-time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They live in a studio, so no privacy. The author values alone time, which is understandable. The husband works part-time and isn't out much, so when the author asks for time alone, he feels it's taking from his limited time at home. He reacts with hurt feelings, which might indicate emotional sensitivity here.\n\nThe author's request seems reasonable, but maybe the communication isn't working. The husband's response of wanting specific hours and activities could be a defense mechanism. The author might be in the right because they need personal space, which is a basic need in a relationship. However, maybe the husband's reaction is valid because he's feeling excluded or not valued. But the key points are that the author has a valid reason (work, need for alone time), and the husband's job is unstable, but that doesn't negate the author's needs. \n\nAlso, there's a mention of plans to move, so maybe a temporary situation. The husband's reaction might be more about feeling insecure in the living situation rather than the request itself. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for a few hours. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The husband's feelings are valid, but the author's need for personal space is justified.\n"
