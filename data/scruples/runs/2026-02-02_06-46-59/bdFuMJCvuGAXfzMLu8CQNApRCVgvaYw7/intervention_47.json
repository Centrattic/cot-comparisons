I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small space with no separate rooms. Both are home a lot. The husband works fewer hours, so he's home more. The OP wants some alone time, which is hard in a studio. She's asking him to leave for a few hours sometimes, like on Saturdays, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband isn't really meeting friends often, so maybe he's not used to being out of the house. The OP values alone time, but the husband is taking it personally.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The OP is not asking for a huge amount of time\u2014just a couple of hours. She's working full time, so maybe she needs the mental break. The husband's reaction seems emotional, but that could be because he's not used to being away from home, given his job situation and maybe social habits. The fact that he has days home alone (like Friday and Monday) but still feels like he's not getting a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday might be a bit of an overreaction. \n\nThe OP isn't being mean or selfish; she's trying to communicate her need for space. The problem arises from the husband's response, not the request itself. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's needs. The husband's feeling of being unwelcome is part of the issue, but that doesn't make the OP wrong for asking. It's about communication and compromise. The husband might need to find other ways to occupy himself or socialize more, which the OP is suggesting by asking him to meet friends. However, if his friends are busy, maybe the OP could find other solutions, like using noise-canceling headphones or finding a co-working space. But the initial request for alone time is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the financial situation complicating moving to a bigger apartment is a real issue they can't control right now. The OP is trying to make the best of their current circumstances. The husband's feelings are valid, but the OP's need for personal space is also important. It's a balancing act, but the request itself isn't inherently wrong. The problem seems to be their communication and how they're handling the situation, not the OP's request itself. So, I think the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong."
