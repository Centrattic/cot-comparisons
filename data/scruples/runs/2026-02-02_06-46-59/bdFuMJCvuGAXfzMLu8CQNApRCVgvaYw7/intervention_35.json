I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the author asks their husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values alone time, which is understandable. Living in a small space with someone all the time can be stressful. They mention working full-time, so having personal time is important. The husband works fewer hours and isn't out often, so when the author asks him to leave, it might make him feel like the home isn't his. He might feel rejected or unwelcome, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is asking for a couple of hours to themselves, which is a basic need for many people. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded. The problem might be communication. The author could be more specific about their needs and reassure the husband that it's not about him being unwanted. Maybe setting boundaries without making it seem like an ultimatum would help.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. The husband's feelings are valid, but so is the author's need for space. The key is how they communicate and find solutions together. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting alone time, but perhaps the way the request is made could be improved. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because having personal time is important, and the husband's reaction is more about emotional response than the request itself being wrong.\n"
