I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The setup is a studio apartment with no kids, where she works full-time and he works part-time. She values alone time, which she used to have when living alone. Now that he's moved in, she's asking for some personal space, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. Studio apartments are small, and without kids, the husband has a lot of time at home. She's not refusing to spend time with him; she just wants a few hours to herself. It's reasonable to want some alone time, especially if it's something she's always valued.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction is important. He feels that when she asks him to leave, it makes him feel unwelcome in their home. That's a significant emotional response. He's also pointing out that he's home alone on other days, like Friday and Monday, but that doesn't seem to satisfy him. He's possibly feeling insecure about his role in the relationship or maybe his self-worth is tied to being present in the home.\n\nThe key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author isn't asking for a long time or for him to leave frequently. Just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. The husband's response seems to be more about his feelings of being a second-class citizen in the home rather than the actual time requested. It's possible he's not processing the request as a normal part of sharing a living space but as a personal rejection.\n\nHowever, the author's need for alone time is also legitimate. Living in a studio without personal space can lead to stress. The fact that they can't move yet due to financial reasons compounds the issue. So, the author isn't being unreasonable. The husband's feelings, while valid, might stem from deeper insecurities or not adapting well to shared space dynamics.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? I don't think so. She's asserting her need for personal time, which is a normal and healthy boundary. The problem lies in the husband's reaction and communication. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
