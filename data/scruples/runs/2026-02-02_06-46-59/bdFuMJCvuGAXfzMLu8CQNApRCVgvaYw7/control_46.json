I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife (the author) asks her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why she needs that time, especially since he's home a lot and has free days.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is the lack of personal space in a studio apartment, which the author values. She works full-time, while her husband works part-time. The husband feels that when she asks him to leave, he's not being welcomed in his own home. He also struggles with finding things to do when his friends aren't available. The author is considering moving to a bigger place but financial instability is a barrier.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, her request is about needing solitude, which is something she's always valued. She's not asking for a long time, just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected or unappreciated. He might be feeling that his presence is a burden, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's job situation is unstable, and he might feel isolated since he doesn't go out much. His response about specifying hours and activities could be a way to set boundaries or express his hurt. The author might not be considering his emotional needs here, focusing only on her need for alone time.\n\nThe husband's statement about not having a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday suggests he's trying to communicate that his free time is important too. He's home alone on other days, but he might feel that the author's request is taking away from the little time he has that's not spent in isolation.\n\nNow, considering the balance between personal space and a partner's feelings. It's reasonable for the author to want alone time, especially in a small living space. However, the way the husband is reacting might indicate deeper issues\u2014maybe he's lonely or feels that his needs aren't being met. The author might need to communicate better or find a compromise, like setting specific times for alone time rather than asking him to leave every time. \n\nThe fact that they can't move due to financial reasons adds another layer. They might need to work on finding solutions together, like the husband increasing social activities or the author finding alternative ways to get alone time without making him leave. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. She's not being unreasonable in wanting space, but her request is causing emotional distress to her husband. So maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since her request is for a reasonable amount of time and she's not making him leave constantly, it's more about the husband's reaction. Therefore, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
