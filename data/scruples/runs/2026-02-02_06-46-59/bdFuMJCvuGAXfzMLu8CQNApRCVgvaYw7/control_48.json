I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the context: They live in a studio apartment with no real alone time. The author works full-time, while the husband works part-time. The author values alone time, which they used to have when living alone. Now that they're together, the husband seems to feel that his presence is always required, even when he's not working much. The husband is getting hurt feelings when the author asks for some alone time, interpreting it as not feeling welcome.\n\nThe author's main point is that they need a few hours to themselves, which is reasonable given the living situation. The husband, however, is taking it personally and seems to not understand that the author just needs space, not to exclude him from their home. The author is trying to communicate their needs, but the husband is reacting emotionally. \n\nLooking at the arguments: The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband has plenty of free time, as he's not working much. The author is not refusing to let him stay at home; they're just asking for some time apart. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling unvalued than about the actual request. The author is trying to maintain their mental health and need for personal space, which is valid. \n\nThe husband's job instability and financial issues are mentioned, but those don't absolve him of understanding his partner's needs. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The problem seems to be more on the husband's side for not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing a legitimate need for personal space in a shared living situation. The husband's reaction is the issue here, not the request itself.\n"
