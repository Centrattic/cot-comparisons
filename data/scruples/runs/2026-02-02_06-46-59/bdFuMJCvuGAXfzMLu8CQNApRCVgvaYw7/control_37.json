I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a spouse asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours to have some alone time. They live in a studio apartment with no kids, and the husband works part-time. The key points here are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of being unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wants alone time, which is a valid need. Many people value personal space, especially in a small living arrangement like a studio. The husband, on the other hand, feels hurt and doesn't understand why his presence is an issue. He's concerned about not being welcomed and feels the request is unreasonable given his availability on other days.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the husband has plenty of time alone during the week when the author is working. The husband's job allows him to be home a lot, so the author doesn't see the problem. However, the husband is getting defensive and making it about not having a relaxing weekend. The author is trying to meet halfway by planning a day trip, but the husband's response seems to escalate the issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is asking for a few hours of alone time, which is reasonable. It's not about excluding the husband all the time but having moments of solitude. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling that his needs aren't being considered, but the author's need for personal space isn't unreasonable either. The husband's job situation and financial instability add complexity, but that doesn't negate the author's valid need for alone time. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to balance their own mental health and preferences. The husband's hurt feelings might be because he's not used to the living arrangement, but the author has explained the situation and their reasons. Since they're in a big city with housing challenges, moving isn't an immediate option. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking some alone time, especially when they're working full-time and the husband has more flexible hours. The husband's reaction seems to be an overreaction in this context. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
