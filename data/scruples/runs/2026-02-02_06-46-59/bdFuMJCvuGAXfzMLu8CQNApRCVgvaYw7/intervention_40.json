I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman who lives in a studio apartment with her husband. She's working full-time, and he works part-time, around 10-20 hours a week. They don't have kids, so most of the time, they're both home. She values alone time and sometimes asks him to leave for a few hours to have some privacy. However, when she asks, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She mentions that he doesn't go out much or meet friends often, so she's asking him to do something he's not used to. She also points out that he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday, but he's upset about not having a relaxing weekend if he has to leave on Saturday. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues due to his unstable job.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. I need to determine if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, consider the studio apartment's limitations. It's a small space, so alone time is hard to come by. She works full-time, which might make her need for personal time more valid. But he's home a lot, and his part-time job might contribute to his need for a home that feels like his. When she asks him to leave, he reacts emotionally, feeling unwelcome. That's a key point. \n\nCommunication seems to be an issue here. The author wants alone time, but she's not meeting his emotional needs when she asks him to leave. Maybe the way she's phrasing her requests is making him feel excluded. Also, he's not meeting friends often, so perhaps he's struggling with social activities and doesn't have an easy escape. \n\nOn the other hand, she's trying to balance her own need for space in a cramped environment. It's not unreasonable for her to want some time to herself, especially since she's working full-time. But the problem arises when her request causes him emotional distress. They need to find a middle ground. \n\nThe fact that he's home alone on other days (like Friday and Monday) might not be as relevant if his perception is that Saturday is his only relaxed day. Maybe he's using that day to compensate for his other days being busy or lonely. \n\nThe financial aspect of moving is a real constraint. So they can't solve this by moving, which is a valid point. That means they have to work on their current situation. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong for needing alone time. It's a common issue in small living spaces. However, the way she's handling it might be causing hurt feelings. Perhaps she could communicate better, find alternative ways to create space, or agree on specific times. \n\nThe husband's reaction might be exaggerated, but his feelings are real. He needs to feel at home in their shared space. Maybe he's not used to the dynamic of living with someone else and isn't handling the adjustment well. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but she might need to approach the situation more sensitively. The husband's response is also a problem, as he's not being understanding of her needs. Both need to communicate better. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that her need for space is reasonable, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. However, there's room for both to adjust their expectations and communication.\n"
