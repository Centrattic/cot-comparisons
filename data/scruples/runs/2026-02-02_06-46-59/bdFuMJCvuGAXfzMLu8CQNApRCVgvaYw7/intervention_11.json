I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the author wants some alone time by asking their husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome in the home. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author values alone time and mentions that they love living alone, which makes sense. They work full time, so maybe they need that personal space to recharge. The husband works part-time and spends a lot of time at home. The problem arises when the author asks him to leave so they can have some time to themselves. The husband gets hurt, which suggests he might feel that his presence is a burden or that he's not part of the home. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is asking for a few hours of alone time unreasonable? The author isn't asking for the entire day, just a couple of hours. Given that the husband already has a lot of time alone on days when they're both home, maybe the author is justified in wanting some space. However, the husband's reaction is about feeling unwelcome. That could imply that he's not comfortable with the idea of being sent out, perhaps because he feels the apartment should be a shared space where both can be together. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the husband doesn't socialize much outside the home. If he's not meeting friends often, maybe the request for him to go out for a few hours could actually encourage him to engage more with others. But the husband seems to resist that, which might indicate a deeper issue with his need for social interaction versus the author's need for alone time. \n\nThe author isn't asking for the husband to be away all day; just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. The husband's response is to question how many hours are needed and what he can do, which might show he's not open to the idea and is perhaps trying to make it a bigger issue than it is. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is clear about their needs and is trying to communicate them. The husband's reaction of feeling hurt and not welcome might stem from insecurity or a different need for companionship. If the husband can't respect the author's need for some personal space, that could be a problem in the relationship. \n\nThe fact that they haven't moved to a bigger apartment yet due to financial issues adds context. Maybe the author didn't anticipate the living arrangement would cause issues, and they're trying to find a solution within their current constraints. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like they're trying to balance their need for alone time with their partner's presence. The husband's reaction is more about feeling unwelcome and hurt, which might be an overreaction. If the author is reasonable in their request (a couple of hours, not every day), then they aren't being unreasonable. The husband's response might be the issue here. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting some space, especially given the living situation and their own needs. The husband's feelings are valid, but the author's request is reasonable. The problem might be more about how the husband is handling the request rather than the request itself. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
