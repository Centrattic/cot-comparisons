I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They live in a studio apartment, which has no separate rooms, so they're always together when both are home. The husband works part-time, so he's home more often. The author values alone time and wants to have a few hours to themselves, which they couldn't get with him around. They\u2019ve tried to ask him to go out or meet friends, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They\u2019re planning a day trip and the husband is upset about not having a relaxing weekend if he can't stay home on Saturday. The author is frustrated because he has free time on other days but still feels the need for a weekend when he's not home. Also, they can't move to a bigger place right now due to financial issues.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to personal space, especially in a situation where the shared living space doesn't allow for privacy. It's not uncommon for people to need alone time, and the author is being direct about their needs. However, the husband's reaction seems to indicate that he's feeling excluded or not valued in the home. His job situation is part-time and unstable, which might make him feel less secure or more dependent on the relationship for social interaction. His hurt feelings suggest that he might feel the author is rejecting him, even if that's not the intention.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are expressing a legitimate need for alone time, which is reasonable. The problem seems more on the husband's side for feeling unwelcome instead of trying to find a compromise. The author isn't making him leave every day, just occasionally. The husband could use the other days he's free to socialize or find activities. The author is also considering the financial constraints when talking about moving, so they're not ignoring his circumstances.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could be more empathetic in how they communicate their needs. Telling someone to leave for specific hours without considering their feelings might come off as dismissive. But the core issue is the lack of personal space. In a studio apartment, this is a common problem for couples. The author isn't doing anything unreasonable. The husband's reaction seems extreme given that he has free time other days. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
