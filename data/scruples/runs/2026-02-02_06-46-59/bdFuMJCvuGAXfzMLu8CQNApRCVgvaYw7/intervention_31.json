I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The husband is in a studio apartment, which is small, and the author values alone time. The husband works part-time and isn't going out much, so when the author asks him to leave for a few hours, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author thinks they might be in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. Studio apartments can be tough because there's no separation between living areas. The author works full-time and might need some time to unwind, read, or do activities without the presence of their partner. It's reasonable to want some alone time, especially if they've always enjoyed living alone.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is part-time and spends a lot of time at home. When the author asks him to leave, he feels hurt and maybe neglected. He might feel like his presence is an inconvenience, which can affect the relationship dynamics. His job situation is unstable, so financial constraints are a factor in not moving into a bigger place. The husband's reaction might be based on feelings of insecurity or not feeling integrated into the home.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's request for alone time isn't unreasonable, but the husband's emotional response indicates that his feelings of being unwelcome are significant. It's possible that the husband's need for validation and inclusion is being overlooked. However, the author's need for personal space is also legitimate. \n\nI should also consider the context of their living situation. Studio apartments inherently limit privacy. The author's previous experience of living alone might make this adjustment harder. The husband's part-time work and limited social activities mean he's home more, which could lead to dependency on the shared space. \n\nThe husband's response of needing specific hours and activities when asked to leave might suggest he doesn't have many options for filling his time, which could be a point of contention. The author's insistence on having those hours might not be the issue, but the husband's perception of being excluded from his own home is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have valid needs. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking alone time, but there might be a communication issue. The husband's hurt feelings and the way he reacts could be where the problem lies. The author might need to approach the situation with more sensitivity, perhaps finding compromises or discussing expectations upfront. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's request isn't unjustified. They have a right to personal space, especially given the living conditions. However, the husband's emotional reaction and the underlying issues of feeling unwelcome might indicate deeper problems. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both to work on understanding each other's needs better. The husband's response seems more problematic than the author's initial request. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
