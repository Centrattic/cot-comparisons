I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. The scenario is that they live in a studio apartment, which means no private space. The author works full time, and the husband works part-time. The husband doesn't go out much or meet friends often, so he's home a lot. The author values alone time and sometimes asks him to leave so she can have a few hours to herself. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They're considering moving but can't due to financial reasons.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. Let me break it down. The author's request for personal space is reasonable, especially in a small living situation. It's common for people to need alone time. The husband's reaction seems sensitive\u2014feeling unwelcome when asked to leave. Maybe he's used to being together a lot, but the author's request isn't to exclude him all the time, just occasionally. The husband's argument about having free time is a bit confusing. If he's home alone on other days, why the issue on a specific Saturday? Maybe he feels like his need for relaxation is not being considered. However, the author's need for personal time is also valid. The problem seems to be communication and balancing both needs. The author isn't wrong for wanting alone time, but maybe the way she's approaching it could be more considerate. But the main point is whether she's in the wrong. Since both have valid needs, but the husband's overreaction is more about his feelings of exclusion, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
