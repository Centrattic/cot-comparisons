I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no privacy. The wife works full-time, and the husband works 10-20 hours a week. She values alone time, which she couldn't get when he's around. She's tried to suggest he meet friends on Saturdays, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also questions the exact hours and activities. Now, they're going on a day trip Sunday, and he's upset if he can't stay home Saturday. The user mentions that he's home alone on Friday and Monday, so they don't see his issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is asking for personal space, which is a reasonable need. Living in a studio apartment with someone else means shared space, so needing alone time is normal. The husband's reaction\u2014feeling hurt and unwelcome\u2014might indicate he has unmet needs too. He might be feeling neglected or not included, especially if he's home most of the time. His job situation is unstable, so maybe he's struggling with not having a strong social life or feeling underemployed. \n\nThe wife is trying to communicate her need for space, but the husband is interpreting it as a rejection. The key here is whether asking for a few hours alone is unreasonable. Since they don't have kids, and the husband has a lot of free time, she's not asking for something excessive. It's about personal boundaries. However, the husband's feelings are valid too. He might need more emotional support or ways to engage in activities that make him feel fulfilled. \n\nThe fact that they're in a big city with affordable housing issues complicates moving to a bigger place. So the immediate solution isn't feasible. The wife isn't wrong for needing space, but maybe there's a communication gap. The husband's reaction might stem from insecurity about his role in the relationship or self-esteem issues due to his job situation. The wife isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if she's explaining her need clearly. However, it's a two-way challenge. The husband might need to find his own outlets for social time and personal happiness beyond just staying home. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the wife is justified in asking for time to herself. The husband's feelings are important too, but he might need to work on his own needs and communication. The answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because having alone time is a legitimate need, and the issue is more about mutual understanding and addressing both partners' needs.\n"
