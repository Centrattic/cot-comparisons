I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours because they want alone time. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so when she asks him to leave for a few hours, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is seeking personal space, which is a valid need. People value solitude for different reasons, like reading, relaxing, or just mental health. The husband's reaction is about feeling excluded and not having a home. He's working less, so maybe he's home a lot, but not having a good outlet for social activities.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe not. Let's break it down. The author's request is reasonable because they need alone time. However, the way the husband is reacting seems hurt and defensive. The key here is whether the request is fair. Since they live in a studio and the husband is home most of the time, maybe the husband isn't using the time productively or socially. But the author's need for alone time isn't unreasonable either.\n\nAlso, the husband is making a big deal about the author specifying exact hours and what he's supposed to do. That seems like he's not taking responsibility for finding his own activities. The author isn't asking him to leave every day, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband's statement about not having a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday is a bit odd, considering he's home on Friday and Monday. Maybe he's not using his free time well, but that's on him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might need to communicate better. Instead of just asking him to leave, maybe discussing the importance of alone time and finding a compromise. But the husband's reaction is more about feeling unwelcome, which is a valid emotional response. However, the author has the right to their own space. Since they can't find a bigger apartment due to financial issues, maybe they need to work on other solutions, like setting boundaries within the studio.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the husband is being overly sensitive and not taking initiative to manage his time or social life. The author's request is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The husband's reaction is the problem here, not the request itself.\n"
