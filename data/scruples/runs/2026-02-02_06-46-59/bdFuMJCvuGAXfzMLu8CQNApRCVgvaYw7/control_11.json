I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small space with no separate rooms. The husband works only 10-20 hours a week, so he's home a lot. The wife works full-time and wants some alone time, which she can't get because he's always there. She's asking him to leave for a couple of hours, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They're considering moving to a bigger place but can't due to financial issues.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The wife needs personal space, which is a reasonable request. Living in a studio apartment means shared space, so having some time alone isn't unreasonable. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or not part of the home, but he's home all the time anyway. The wife isn't kicking him out permanently, just temporarily to have some time for herself. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the husband feels neglected or that his presence is a burden. But he has a lot of free time and isn't meeting friends often. The wife is trying to communicate her needs, which is important in a relationship. It's about balance. The husband's response (feeling hurt and needing specifics) could indicate he's not handling the request well. \n\nFinancial constraints prevent them from moving, so they need to find solutions within their current situation. The wife's request for time alone is about her mental health and well-being. It's not about him not having a home, since he's there all the time. The fact that he's home alone on other days doesn't negate her need for some personal time.\n\nSo, considering all that, the wife isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs, which is healthy. The husband's reaction is more problematic because he's not respecting her need for space. But the question is about the wife's actions. Since she's not abusive or unreasonable, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
