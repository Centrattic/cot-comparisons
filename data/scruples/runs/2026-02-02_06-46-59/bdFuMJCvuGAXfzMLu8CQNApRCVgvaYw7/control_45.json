I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a wife asking her husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon to have some alone time. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, and the wife is frustrated because he doesn't go out much and she values her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife lives in a studio apartment, which is small, and they don't have kids. She works full-time, and her husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. She wants some alone time, which is understandable. People need personal space, especially in a small living environment. But the husband is taking her request as a rejection, feeling like he isn't welcome in his own home. That's a strong emotional response. He might feel like he's being excluded or that his presence is a burden.\n\nThe wife mentions that he doesn't socialize much, so maybe he's already feeling isolated. When she asks him to leave, it could be hitting a nerve. She's trying to communicate her need for space, but he's interpreting it as not wanting him to be there at all. There's a communication gap here. The wife might not be considering how her husband feels about being asked to leave, even if it's for a short time. On the other hand, the husband isn't meeting her need for alone time, which is valid.\n\nThe story also mentions financial instability and the difficulty of moving to a bigger apartment. That adds context\u2014they can't just move right now. So the wife is stuck in a situation where her need for space isn't being met through other means. She's trying to find a solution by asking him to leave, but he's resistant.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong? Well, asking for alone time isn't inherently wrong. Everyone needs that. But maybe the way she's communicating it could be hurtful if she's not considering his feelings. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated, but it's not entirely his fault if he feels unwelcome. Maybe they need to work on their communication. The wife could try to explain her need more compassionately, and the husband could find alternative ways to spend time when he's alone. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's asserting her own needs in a difficult situation, and he's not fulfilling her request, I think the answer is that she's not in the wrong. So B.\n"
