I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is they live in a studio apartment, which gives them almost no alone time. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so when the author asks for some time alone, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially in a small living situation. It's common for people to value alone time, especially after a full-time job. The husband, on the other hand, feels that his home is being taken away from him. He might feel neglected or unimportant if his partner wants him to leave. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is trying to set a boundary to have time for themselves, which is reasonable. However, the way the husband reacts (feeling hurt and wanting specific times) might indicate he's not processing the request as a mutual effort but as a personal rejection. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by requesting their own space. The issue seems to be more about the husband's reaction and the communication gap between them. The financial constraints mentioned also add stress, possibly affecting their dynamics. \n\nI need to check if there's any imbalance. The author doesn't avoid helping the husband find activities; instead, the husband resists. The author's request is for a couple of hours, which isn't excessive. The husband's response seems more about feeling unwelcome rather than the actual time requested. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have some autonomy. The author's need for alone time is a normal part of a relationship. The husband's feelings are valid too, but he might need to address his own social activities to avoid dependency. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies more in the husband's reaction and the communication between them.\n"
