I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple lives in a studio apartment, which means no alone time when both are home. The author works full time, while her husband works only 10-20 hours a week. She values alone time, so she wants him to leave for a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. But he gets hurt and feels unwelcome, thinking the home isn't his. They're also planning a day trip, and he's upset that he can't be home on Saturday because he wants a relaxing weekend. However, he has free time on Friday and Monday.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. \n\nLet me break it down. The author wants alone time, which is reasonable. People need personal space, especially in a small living situation. However, the husband is working less and doesn't go out much, so he might be spending a lot of time at home. The problem is that when she asks him to leave, he reacts negatively, feeling unwelcome. That's a key point. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for asking him to leave? Well, she's not doing it every day, just sometimes. She's not kicking him out all the time, just a couple of hours. But his reaction is emotional\u2014feeling hurt and not welcome. That suggests communication issues. Maybe she didn't explain her need for alone time properly, or he feels like he's being rejected. \n\nAlso, the husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place yet. So maybe he's feeling insecure, and the request for him to leave exacerbates that. The author might not realize how his limited social life and work hours make him feel about the home being his. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's need for alone time is valid. In a studio apartment, it's hard to have privacy. She's not asking to move out or anything, just some time apart. It's a common issue in couples where one person needs more space. \n\nBut the way the husband is reacting\u2014getting hurt and needing specifics\u2014might indicate that he's taking it as rejection. The author might not be considering his feelings enough. Maybe she should find a way to balance her need for alone time with his emotional needs. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of both. She has a valid need for personal time, but the husband's reaction suggests that their communication isn't aligned. The problem isn't entirely her fault. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not being unreasonable in asking for a few hours alone, maybe the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not feeling at home, which might be a deeper issue in their relationship. The author might need to address that with him, but the initial request isn't her fault.\n"
