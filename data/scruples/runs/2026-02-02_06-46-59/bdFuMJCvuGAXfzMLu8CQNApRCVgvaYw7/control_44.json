I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe main issue is the couple living in a studio apartment with no separate rooms. The wife works full-time, and the husband works part-time, so he's home more. The wife wants some alone time, which the husband seems to feel is being taken away from him. She asks him to leave for a few hours on weekends, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband also points out that he's home alone on other days (like Fridays and Mondays) but doesn't use that time to go out. The wife values her solo time, having lived alone before, and they can't move due to financial issues.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the wife has a valid need for personal space. Living in a studio apartment means there's no separation, which can lead to stress for both. The husband's reaction seems to indicate he feels his presence is being resented, even though he's home a lot. But is the wife wrong to ask for time alone? It's important for mental health and personal well-being. However, the way she's asking might be an issue. If she's not considering his feelings or not communicating effectively, that could be a problem. The husband's response of feeling unwelcome is also an issue; he should be able to discuss his feelings without feeling attacked. The fact that he can't find friends to hang out with on his own might contribute to his need to be with her, but that's not entirely her fault. The key is mutual understanding. The wife isn't wrong to want space, but maybe she needs to approach it differently. The husband also needs to take responsibility for his emotional reaction. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would lean towards B (No), as her request is reasonable, but there's room for better communication. However, some might argue she's not considering his feelings enough. But given the scenario, B seems correct.\n"
