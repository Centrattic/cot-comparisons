I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment with no kids, and the husband works part-time. The wife values her alone time a lot, which makes sense because they're in a small space. She wants a few hours to herself, but when she asks, the husband feels upset and doesn't feel welcome. The user wants to know if she's wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has a valid need for personal space, especially in a studio where privacy is hard to come by. She's working full-time, so having time to herself is important for her well-being. On the other hand, the husband feels that when she asks him to leave, it makes him feel unwelcome in his own home. He's not working much, so maybe he's feeling lonely or undervalued.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The wife's request isn't unreasonable, but the way it's being communicated might be causing hurt. The husband's reaction could stem from feeling that his presence is a burden, even if that's not the case. The fact that he's not working much might contribute to his sense of insecurity or lack of purpose.\n\nThey also mention not being able to move to a bigger place due to financial issues. That adds another layer, as they're stuck in a situation that's causing both stress. The wife's need for alone time is balanced against the husband's need to feel included and part of the home.\n\nIt's important to note that both have valid feelings. The wife's request for alone time isn't inherently wrong, but maybe there's a better way to communicate that without making her husband feel rejected. They might need to find a middle ground, like setting specific times for alone space and ensuring the husband has his own activities. Maybe they can also explore other ways to create personal space within the studio, like using headphones or designating certain areas for each person.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's reaction seems a bit over the top, but it's possible he's feeling neglected. The wife isn't wrong for wanting her space, but both could work on improving communication. The answer isn't entirely one-sided. However, based on the context, the wife's request isn't the issue. The problem lies more in how it's being handled and the husband's response. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
