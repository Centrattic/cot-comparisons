I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio, which is a small space, and she wants some alone time. Her husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. He gets hurt when she asks him to go out, feeling unwelcome. The user wants to know if she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially in a small living environment. It's common for people to require some alone time to recharge. On the other hand, the husband feels that his presence is being rejected, which could imply that he's not comfortable with the request, maybe feeling unvalued or that his home isn't his own.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is asking for a couple of hours, not the entire time. It's reasonable to seek personal time, especially since he's home a lot. However, the husband's reaction is hurtful and suggests he might be feeling insecure or not included. Maybe he's using the request as a way to express deeper feelings about not feeling at home.\n\nBut the author isn't asking for anything unreasonable. She's not moving out or refusing to spend time with him; she just wants a few hours to herself. The husband's response of needing specifics and his hurt feelings might indicate he's struggling with the adjustment to living together, especially since he moved in two years ago. The fact that he's not working a lot might contribute to his need for social interaction, but he could also find other activities. The author's situation is valid because living together in a small space can be challenging, and her request is a way to manage that.\n\nAlso, the financial situation is mentioned regarding moving to a bigger place, so that's not an option right now. The author's need for alone time isn't the issue here. The husband's reaction is more about how he perceives the request rather than the request itself. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is more about communication and the husband's feelings of not being included, but the request is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
