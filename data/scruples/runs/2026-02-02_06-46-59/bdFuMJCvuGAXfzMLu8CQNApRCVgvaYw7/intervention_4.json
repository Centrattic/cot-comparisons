I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, and the husband works fewer hours, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time because she values her space. The husband feels hurt and thinks the apartment isn't his, and he gets defensive when she asks for time alone. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for alone time is valid. People often need personal space, especially if they work full-time and don't have that at work. The studio apartment situation makes it hard for both to have privacy. On the other hand, the husband might feel excluded or that his home isn't his. He works less, so being home more is part of his routine. His reaction could stem from feeling that his presence is a burden or that he isn't part of the home.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author is asking for specific time alone, but maybe the way she communicates it is causing hurt feelings. The husband's response about the exact hours and what he should do might be a way of feeling rejected. The fact that he mentions not having a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday, even though he's home alone on other days, suggests he might need more attention or reassurance that he's wanted in the home.\n\nFinancial constraints are also a factor. They can't move to a bigger apartment yet, so they have to work with what they have. The author might not be considering the husband's emotional needs as much as her own, or maybe there's a miscommunication. She might be in the right in needing her space, but perhaps the approach could be adjusted to make the husband feel more included. The husband's feelings of not having a home could be valid, so the author's request, while reasonable, might not account for his emotional state. However, it's not entirely the author's fault if the husband has these feelings. It's a mutual issue that needs discussion and compromise. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but there are aspects where both could improve communication. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
