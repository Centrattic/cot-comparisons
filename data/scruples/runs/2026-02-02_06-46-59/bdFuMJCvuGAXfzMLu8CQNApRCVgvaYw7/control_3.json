I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is basically one big room, so no privacy. The author works full time and her husband works part-time, maybe 10-20 hours a week. He's home a lot, doesn't go out much, and doesn't have many friends. The author wants some alone time, which she used to have when she lived alone. She's trying to get him to leave for a couple hours, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They also can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for personal space, which she mentions she values a lot. In a studio apartment with someone all the time, that's tough. She's working full time, so maybe she's stressed and needs downtime. On the other hand, the husband is home a lot, maybe feeling like he's not part of the home if she wants him to leave. He's working part-time, so maybe he's home more, and if he's not going out, he might not have much social time. When she asks him to go out, he feels it's a rejection, which is understandable. He might feel like he's not wanted in the home he's part of. But the problem is communication. She's asking for something reasonable, but he's taking it as a personal attack. \n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and they can't move. So maybe he's already feeling insecure about their financial situation, and her asking for time alone adds to his stress. But the author is also in a situation where she needs her space. The fact that he's home all the time and not using his free time to socialize could be another issue. Maybe he's not managing his time well, or maybe they need to find a compromise. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, wanting alone time isn't unreasonable. People need personal space. But maybe she's not considering his feelings enough. She wants him to leave, but he's taking it as not feeling welcome. Maybe she needs to communicate better. However, the husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. If he's home all the time and she's working, maybe it's about finding a balance. The fact that he's not able to go out on his own and relies on friends to hang out with might be a problem. The author might need to help him build a social life or find activities he can do independently. \n\nAlso, the husband's job situation is a factor. If he's not working much, maybe he's feeling down, and the author's request to leave might be making him feel even less connected. But the author has a right to her space. The key here is communication and compromise. If she's asking for a few hours, maybe she can explain it's not about rejection but about her need for self-care. The husband might need to work on his own social activities to adjust. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because having a need for alone time is valid. The issue is more about how they communicate and find solutions that work for both. The husband's reaction is problematic, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for expressing her needs.\n"
