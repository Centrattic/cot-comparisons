I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, so privacy is an issue. The author works full-time, while the husband works part-time, maybe 10-20 hours a week. The husband doesn't go out much and meets friends rarely. The author wants some alone time, which is important to them, but when they ask, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a legitimate need for personal space, especially since the apartment is a studio with no separate rooms. They mention they value alone time and used to love living alone. On the other hand, the husband feels that when the author asks him to leave, it makes him feel like the apartment isn't his home. He's not working much and might feel isolated already.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author isn't unreasonable; they're asking for a couple of hours to themselves. However, the husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling excluded or unappreciated. Maybe there's a deeper issue here about his sense of belonging in the relationship. The author's request is about their own mental health and well-being, which is valid. But the husband's emotional response might be due to his own feelings of insecurity or not having enough social interaction outside the home.\n\nI should also consider the context of their financial situation. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of the husband's unstable job and high housing costs in their city. So the author isn't avoiding the problem; they're waiting for their circumstances to improve.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable by asking for alone time? Probably not. Everyone needs some personal space. The husband's reaction, however, is problematic because he's taking it as a personal rejection rather than understanding it's a need for the author. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting time alone, especially when they've already compromised by working full-time and the husband is home more. The issue might be how the husband handles the request, but the author's action isn't the problem. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
