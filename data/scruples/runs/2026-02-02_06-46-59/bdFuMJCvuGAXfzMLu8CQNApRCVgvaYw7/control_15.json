I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a studio apartment, which means no separate rooms. Both are home a lot\u2014she works full-time, he works part-time. She values alone time and sometimes wants to be by herself, but when she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She's also trying to balance this with his feelings and their financial situation because they can't move yet.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal space and communication. She's asking for some time alone, which is reasonable, especially in a small living space. But his reaction is emotional\u2014he feels it's his home too, and when she asks for time alone, he feels excluded. That might mean there's an underlying issue about how he perceives his role in the relationship or his own need for space.\n\nThe user is wondering if she's in the wrong. Well, wanting alone time isn't inherently wrong. It's a common human need. The problem might be more about how they're communicating this need. If she approaches it in a way that makes him feel like he's not part of the home, that could be an issue. But from the description, she's trying to explain her need without being harsh, and she even mentions his free time on other days. \n\nHis reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome, which might not be entirely her fault. Maybe there's a deeper issue in their relationship about how they share space or feel about each other's independence. The fact that he works less and spends more time at home might make him feel like he's always present, so when she asks for time alone, it feels like he's being asked to leave his own space. \n\nAlso, financial constraints prevent them from moving to a bigger place, so they have to work with what they have. She's trying to find a middle ground by suggesting he meet friends or find something to do, but he's not complying. That might mean he's not being flexible, or she's not finding a solution that works for both of them. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. She has a valid need for alone time, which is important for mental health. He has a valid need to feel at home and not be excluded. The problem is in how they're handling each other's needs. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether her request is unreasonable. Since she's asking for a couple of hours and not constantly, it's not unreasonable. The issue is more about how to communicate and find solutions that meet both their needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her need for personal space is valid, and the problem lies in both parties needing to communicate better and find mutually acceptable solutions.\n"
