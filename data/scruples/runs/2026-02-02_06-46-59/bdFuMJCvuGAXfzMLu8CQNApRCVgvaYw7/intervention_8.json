I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. The situation is a studio apartment where both live. The author works full-time, and the husband works part-time. The author wants some alone time, so they ask the husband to leave on weekends, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They value alone time and a studio apartment doesn't allow for privacy. They mention they can't read or watch shows alone because the husband is there. They're not avoiding him completely\u2014they sometimes go to the kitchen, but the lack of space is a problem. They also note the husband's job is unstable, making moving difficult.\n\nThe husband's reaction: He feels hurt, like the home isn't his. He complains about not having a relaxing weekend if he has to leave. But he has days when he's home alone, like Friday and Monday. The author points out he's got plenty of free time.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has a legitimate need for personal space, especially in a studio. It's not just about avoiding the husband but needing time to recharge. The husband's job situation being unstable complicates moving, so the author can't easily solve the space problem. However, the way the author asks might be hurtful. Maybe the husband is struggling with feeling accepted in the home. The author's request is reasonable, but communication might be an issue. They could try other methods, like setting aside specific times for each other, but the request itself isn't inherently wrong. The husband's reaction could stem from insecurity or needing validation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asking for something they need, given their living situation. The husband's feelings are valid, but the author's need for alone time is also important. Maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
