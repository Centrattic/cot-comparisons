I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife (the author) wants her husband to leave for a few hours on a Saturday to have alone time. The husband is hurt and feels unwelcome, which the author doesn't understand because he has plenty of free time otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values alone time, which is reasonable. Living in a studio apartment with no privacy can be stressful. She's working full-time, and he works less, so he's home more. She just wants a few hours to herself. But when she asks, he reacts hurt and wants specific times and plans, which might come off as demanding or making her feel guilty.\n\nThe husband's reaction is important too. Feeling that his home is not welcoming is a big issue. Even if he has time to himself on other days, if he feels excluded or that his partner doesn't respect his presence, that's a problem. The author might be trying to communicate her need for space, but maybe not in a way that acknowledges his feelings. \n\nThe husband's income and job instability are factors in not moving. They can't afford a bigger place, so the current situation is a compromise. But the husband might feel that his needs for companionship or feeling at home aren't being met. The author's request for specific hours and plans might be making him feel like he's being assigned a task, which could be why he's hurt. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, needing personal space is normal, but if the way she's asking is causing hurt feelings, maybe she needs to approach it differently. However, it's not necessarily her fault if the communication isn't working both ways. The husband might also need to take responsibility for his feelings and perhaps be more open to finding a middle ground. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to address her legitimate need for alone time, which isn't inherently wrong. The issue might be more about how the communication is handled. Since the husband is reacting negatively, it's a two-way problem. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's asking for a reasonable request (a few hours alone in a shared space) and the husband's response is the main issue, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The problem is more about communication and mutual understanding rather than one party being entirely at fault.\n"
