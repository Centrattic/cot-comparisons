I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband reacts hurt and feels unwelcome. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife explains that the studio apartment has no alone time because they're always together. She needs personal space, which is a common issue in small living spaces. She mentions that he works part-time and is home a lot, so maybe she's asking for a few hours of privacy. That seems reasonable. People need personal time, and it's not about not caring about their partner but about self-care and mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels hurt and like the apartment isn't his. When she suggests he go out, he gets upset and wants specifics on how long and what he should do. His reaction seems emotional, possibly feeling rejected or unappreciated. He's home a lot because of his job, maybe feeling lonely or needing more social interaction, but instead of focusing on that, he's taking her request for alone time as him not being welcome.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. But I need to consider if her request is unreasonable. She's not asking for days, just a couple of hours. She's also working full-time, which can be tiring, and needing downtime is normal. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of exclusion rather than her request being wrong. Maybe the problem is more about communication. She could have explained her need better, but asking for a few hours alone isn't inherently wrong.\n\nAlso, the husband's job situation is unstable, so maybe he's using that as an excuse. But the wife points out that he has free time on other days. The issue might be that he's not using his free time to do things outside, leading to him being home more. However, the wife's need for space is legitimate. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not being part of the home, but the request is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
