I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment with no privacy. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time but when she asks, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. Studio apartments are hard because there's no separation between living areas. She works full-time and he's home more. She wants time to herself, which is normal. But the husband takes it as being excluded from his own home. He might feel like his presence is a burden. His job is unstable, so maybe he's already stressed. He might not have a lot of social outlets, so when she asks him to leave, it affects his ability to relax.\n\nThe author is asking him to find things to do when he doesn't have friends to meet. That could be tough for him. Also, the husband mentions having free time on other days like Friday and Monday but still feels like the weekend is his only relaxing time. So maybe he's not using his other free time effectively. But the author might not realize that his mental health is being affected by being asked to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's need for solitude is also valid. She's used to living alone and misses that. The problem seems to be communication. They haven't resolved this by finding a bigger apartment yet because of financial issues. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but perhaps she could approach it differently. Instead of asking him to leave, maybe they could find activities they can do separately in the apartment or negotiate specific times without being confrontational.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The husband's reaction is emotional, which might be an overreaction, but his feelings are real. The author might not be considering his emotional state enough. She's asking for time alone, which is okay, but the way she's doing it might be making him feel unwelcome. Maybe she's not balancing their needs properly. The answer might depend on whether the request is reasonable given their living situation and communication.\n\nAlternatively, since the husband has a lot of free time and the author needs alone time, maybe the author isn't wrong. It's about mutual needs conflicting. The husband's reaction might be the issue here, not the request itself. But the author could be more empathetic in how she makes the request. So maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. So answer B (not in the wrong) but with a note about communication.\n"
