I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The main issue is about needing alone time in a shared studio apartment. The husband works part-time and spends a lot of time at home, which the author finds limiting her personal space. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for solitude, which is important for mental well-being. Studio apartments are small, so having no alone time can be stressful. She's working full-time, so it's reasonable she wants some time to herself. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels hurt and unwelcome when asked to leave. He's part of a shared living arrangement, so he might feel that his presence is a given, and being asked to leave could make him feel like an outsider. His job is unstable, and he might not have many social opportunities, so when he does have time, he might rely on being with his spouse. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling unappreciated or not part of the home. He wants clear boundaries and specific plans for when he should leave, which could indicate he's trying to understand the expectations. The author's request for time alone isn't unreasonable, but the husband's emotional response complicates things. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for needing personal space, but maybe the way the request is made or the lack of communication could be an issue. However, the core problem is the living situation's constraints. They can't move to a bigger place yet due to financial issues. The husband's feelings might stem from deeper issues about feeling insecure in their relationship or his role in the household. \n\nSince the author is asking for a couple of hours alone, which is a reasonable request for self-care, and the husband's reaction is more about feeling unaccepted, the fault isn't entirely on the author. It's a mutual issue needing better communication and understanding. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
