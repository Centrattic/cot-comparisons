I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment, and the author wants some alone time, so they ask their husband to leave for a few hours. The husband is upset, feeling unvalued and not welcome in his own home.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author values alone time, which is important for personal well-being. Living in a small space can make that hard, especially if one partner is home more often. The husband, on the other hand, is working fewer hours and might feel that the apartment is his home too. His reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome and maybe insecure about his role in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author is asking for personal space, which is reasonable. But the way the husband is reacting\u2014feeling hurt and needing specific hours\u2014might indicate deeper issues. The author might need to explain their needs clearly without making the husband feel excluded. However, the husband's job instability and financial stress could add pressure, making him more sensitive about their living situation.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether asking for alone time is fair. Since the author isn't rejecting the husband but just needing space, and considering they don't have kids, it's a balance. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling unappreciated, but the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their needs. The main issue is communication and finding a middle ground. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
