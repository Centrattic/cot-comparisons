I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user wants to know if the author (the wife) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife values alone time, which is something she loved when living alone. The husband works part-time, so he's home more often, and when she asks him to leave, he reacts negatively. He feels it's his home too and doesn't understand why she needs him to go out. He also mentions not being able to go to the sea on Sunday, so he wants to have his time on Saturday. The wife points out that he's home alone on Friday and might have Monday off too, so why Saturday is an issue. They can't move to a bigger place due to financial reasons.\n\nSo, the key points are the need for personal space versus the feeling of being excluded. The wife has a valid need for solitude, especially since they live in a small space. The husband's reaction is emotional, feeling like he's not welcome. The wife isn't being unreasonable by asking for a few hours, but maybe she could communicate better. However, his reaction might be over the top. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's not being selfish in a way that's malicious. She's trying to maintain her mental health and personal time. The husband's issue is more about his feelings of rejection. However, the way she asks him to leave might not consider his feelings. Maybe she could find a middle ground, like suggesting activities he can do alone or compromising on the time. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's asserting her need for space, which is reasonable, but the husband's feelings are also valid. However, in the scenario, the wife is the one seeking the alone time, and the husband is the one struggling. The answer would likely be B (No), because she's not in the wrong. People need personal space, and her request isn't unreasonable given the living situation. The husband's reaction indicates he needs to adjust his expectations and perhaps communicate his feelings better. The wife isn't being inconsiderate; she's trying to balance her needs with their current circumstances.\n"
