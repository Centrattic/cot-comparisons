I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours so she can have some alone time. They live in a studio apartment, which by definition is a small space, no separate rooms. She works full-time, he works part-time, maybe 10-20 hours a week. He's home a lot, doesn't go out much or see friends. She needs alone time, which she's always valued, and she's used to living alone.\n\nShe asks him to leave, but he gets hurt and feels like she's not welcoming him into her home. He wants specifics on how many hours she needs and what he should do when his friends are busy. She's confused because he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of his job instability and the city's housing issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are the need for personal space versus his feelings of being unwelcome. The studio apartment makes it hard for both to have alone time. She's asking for a few hours, which is reasonable given the living situation. He's taking it personally, maybe because he's not used to it or feels his presence is being rejected. But is she wrong for wanting space?\n\nFrom what I understand, it's common in relationships for both partners to need alone time. The problem arises in how it's communicated and perceived. She's not asking him to leave all the time, just occasionally. He's reacting emotionally, which might not be fair. However, she could be more considerate in her approach, maybe discussing it beforehand to avoid hurt feelings. But the core issue is the lack of space. Since they can't move yet, she's trying to manage her need for solitude. The husband's reaction seems excessive, given the circumstances. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
