I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why she needs that time, especially since he's home a lot anyway.\n\nFirst, the studio apartment means there's no privacy. The wife works full-time, and the husband works part-time. She values her alone time, which makes sense. But when she asks him to leave, he gets upset, thinking he's not welcome. He wants specifics on how many hours and what he should do. \n\nThe wife's reasoning is that she misses living alone and needs that personal space. The husband's response is emotional, feeling that he doesn't have a relaxing weekend if he can't stay home. But he already has a lot of free time on other days. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Well, the wife's request seems reasonable. Everyone needs alone time, especially in a small space. But the husband's reaction might stem from feeling isolated. Maybe he's not getting enough social interaction outside the home, so when she asks him to leave, he feels even more alone. \n\nBut the husband also has the option to go out more on his own. If he's not meeting friends, maybe he should take the initiative to find something to do. However, the wife's request should be respected if it's reasonable. \n\nThe fact that they can't move to a bigger place yet complicates things. They need to find a balance. The wife isn't being unreasonable by wanting some time alone, but maybe she could communicate better, explaining why it's important instead of just asking him to leave. However, the husband's hurt feelings might indicate deeper issues about his role in the relationship or his own need for social engagement. \n\nSo, the author (the wife) is asking for a couple of hours of privacy, which is a common need. The husband's reaction is perhaps overreacting, but maybe he feels neglected. Depending on the context, the wife's actions aren't wrong because she's asserting her need for space, which is important for mental health. The husband should work on managing his feelings and maybe find ways to enjoy his alone time constructively. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
