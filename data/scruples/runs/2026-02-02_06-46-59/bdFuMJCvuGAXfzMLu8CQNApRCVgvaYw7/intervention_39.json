I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let's break down the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, so there's no separate rooms. The husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week) and doesn't go out much or meet friends often. The author works full-time and really values alone time, which is hard to get in a studio when both are home. She asks him to leave on Saturday afternoons for a couple of hours so she can have some privacy. But when she does this, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome, even though she's not kicking him out all the time. The husband is home alone on other days like Friday and Monday, and they can't move to a bigger place right now due to his unstable job and high housing costs in the city.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author has a legitimate need for personal space. Studio apartments are known for being cramped, and even if they can do things like go to the kitchen, the lack of separate areas can make it hard to have alone time. She's not asking for a long time, just a couple of hours each Saturday. That seems reasonable, especially since she's working full-time and might need some time to decompress.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is part-time and seems to be struggling with feeling like he has a place in the home. If he's not going out often and spends a lot of time at home, maybe the author's request is affecting his sense of belonging. He's taking it personally, saying he doesn't feel welcome, which is a red flag. It's possible he's using the request as a way to express deeper feelings of insecurity or not being integrated into the shared living space.\n\nThe key point here is the reasonableness of the request. The author is not asking for a long period or something unreasonable. She's just seeking some time to herself, which is important for mental well-being. The husband's reaction seems more about emotional sensitivity rather than the actual request. He's home a lot, and the author's alone time is necessary. The fact that they can't move yet due to financial reasons doesn't negate the author's need for space. \n\nHowever, the way the request is made might be an issue. If she's asking him to meet friends specifically, maybe he feels like he's being forced into a social activity rather than just having time alone. The husband might feel like the author is rejecting him, which is why he's hurt. It's possible they need to communicate better about the request being for personal time, not pushing him out. But the author's need for alone time is valid. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's needs. The author isn't being selfish; she's acknowledging the situation and trying to find a solution. The husband's inability to go out and his reaction could be a sign that he's not comfortable with the dynamic or has unaddressed feelings. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting her own space, especially in a living arrangement that makes it difficult. The main problem might be the husband's response and his perception of the request. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
