I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours. The situation is they live in a studio apartment, which is small. The author works full time, and the husband works part-time. The author wants some alone time because they miss living alone, but when they ask the husband to go out, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. First, the author's request for alone time seems reasonable. They have a valid reason\u2014they value privacy and the apartment is small. But maybe the way they're asking is causing issues? The husband feels like his home isn't welcoming, and he's not getting the same space. He's home a lot, maybe he's not used to it. The author might not realize that the husband needs his own space too, or that being asked to leave multiple times is making him feel like he's not part of the home.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a legitimate need for solitude. They mention they can't read or watch shows alone without feeling it's different. The husband's job is unstable, so they can't move yet. The author isn't wrong to want their needs met. But maybe they could communicate better. Instead of asking him to leave, maybe they could schedule times when they both have alone time? It's a balance. Both need personal space. The husband's reaction is emotional, which complicates things. He's taking it personally, which isn't helpful. \n\nBut the author's action\u2014asking for time alone\u2014doesn't seem wrong. They're not being selfish; they're trying to maintain their mental health. The problem might be in the communication and the husband's sensitivity. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
