I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours so she can have alone time. They live in a studio apartment, which makes privacy tough. She works full-time, while he works part-time (10-20 hours a week) and doesn't go out much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values alone time and has always loved living alone. The husband, on the other hand, feels hurt when she asks him to leave, thinking it means he isn't welcome in his own home. He also seems concerned about not having a relaxing weekend if he can't stay home on Saturday, even though he has other days when he's alone.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author might be justified in needing personal space, especially given the living situation. But the husband's feelings are also valid. He might feel that his presence is being rejected, especially since he's home a lot. However, the husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author isn't asking him to leave all the time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The fact that he brings up the day trip and seems to focus on the weekend as his only relaxing time could indicate he's not considering her needs equally. Also, he's home alone on other days like Friday and possibly Monday, which might not be acknowledged enough by him.\n\nThe author's request is specific and limited, not a constant demand. The husband's response of wanting exact hours and what he should do when friends aren't available might be a way of resisting the request rather than negotiating. The author isn't at fault for needing time to herself, especially in a space where privacy is hard. However, maybe she could communicate better to explain her needs without making him feel unwelcome. But overall, the husband's reaction seems more problematic. He needs to adjust his feelings and understand that alone time is important for the author's well-being. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially when they discussed moving to a bigger apartment once his job situation improves. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
