I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment with their husband. The author wants some alone time, so they ask their husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author values their alone time and has a valid reason\u2014working full-time and needing space. Studio apartments are small, so having someone around all the time can be stressful. The husband works fewer hours and spends a lot of time at home. When asked to go out, he feels like he's not accepted in the home. His job is unstable, and they can't move because of financial constraints. \n\nThe author's request is for a few hours on Saturday. The husband's reaction seems emotional, feeling that his home isn't welcoming. But the author points out that he's home alone on other days, like Friday and Monday. The husband's friends aren't always available, so he might be struggling to find things to do. \n\nIs the author's request unreasonable? They're not asking him to leave all the time, just a couple of hours. They mentioned that they don't mind him being home the rest of the time. The husband's feelings are valid, but the author's need for alone time is also legitimate. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The husband's reaction of being hurt and asking for specific hours might be overreacting. The author isn't asking him to leave every time, just occasionally. \n\nFinancial constraints make moving difficult, so the author can't just get a bigger place. They can't be blamed for trying to manage their living situation. The husband's response seems to take it more personally than it should. The author isn't being selfish; they're asking for time to recharge. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their space, especially given the circumstances. The husband needs to adjust and find ways to be independent, but the author's request is reasonable.\n"
