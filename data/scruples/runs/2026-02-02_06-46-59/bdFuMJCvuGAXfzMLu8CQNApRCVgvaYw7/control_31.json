I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. She needs alone time, which she's always valued. But her husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome when she asks for time alone. He's home a lot because his job is part-time, and he doesn't have many social activities. The problem is that when she asks him to be out, he becomes defensive and wants exact hours and activities.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author needs personal space, which is a valid need. Living in a studio with someone all the time can be draining. On the other hand, the husband feels like the apartment isn't his home, and his feelings are getting hurt. He might feel like he's being rejected or not included. \n\nBut the key points here are mutual needs. The author is not asking for the whole weekend or an unreasonable amount of time. Just a few hours on a Saturday. The husband has plenty of free time during the week, so maybe his reaction is about deeper issues of feeling insecure or not part of the home. The fact that he's home alone a lot might mean he's struggling with social isolation, so when the author asks for time alone, it triggers those feelings. \n\nHowever, the author's need for personal space is also valid. She's working full-time and might need that time to recharge. The husband's response is about his feelings, but the request itself isn't excessive. The problem seems to be communication and how the request is framed. If she's asking in a way that makes him feel like he's not welcome, that could be an issue. But the core need for alone time isn't wrong. \n\nAlso, the husband's job situation is unstable, which might contribute to his anxiety. They're planning to move when his situation improves, which is a future solution. For now, they need to manage their current living situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for needing alone time. The fault might lie in how the request is made or in the husband's reaction, but the act of asking for personal space is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
