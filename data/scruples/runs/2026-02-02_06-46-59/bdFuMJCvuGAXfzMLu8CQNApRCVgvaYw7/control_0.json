I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time, so she asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband reacts negatively, feeling unwelcome and hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Studio apartments are small, so personal space is limited. The wife values her alone time, which is understandable. She works full-time, and the husband works part-time. He's home more, which might contribute to the need for separation. The husband's reaction seems emotional, feeling that his home isn't his if he can't be there. But he also doesn't have a lot of social activities, so maybe he's used to being around the wife all the time.\n\nThe key points are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of rejection. The wife isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband's response is about feeling unwelcome, but the wife isn't evicting him. It's about temporary alone time. The husband's issue might stem from insecurity or a lack of social life, making him rely more on her for companionship.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving to a bigger place. The wife's request isn't about moving out but having time to herself. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate if he has other days when he's home alone. It's possible he's not respecting her need for space, but she's also not invalidating his feelings entirely. She's trying to communicate her needs but he's not responding constructively.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both sides have valid points. However, the wife's request for personal time is reasonable. The husband's hurt feelings might be more about his adjustment to living together. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No) because she's advocating for her own needs in a shared space. The husband's reaction is more about his emotional response rather than a clear right or wrong action from her. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
