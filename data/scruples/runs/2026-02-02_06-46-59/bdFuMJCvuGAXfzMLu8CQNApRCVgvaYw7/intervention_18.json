I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which means they have no private space. The author wants some alone time because she values it, but her husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why she needs time away when he's home alone other days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since they're in a small living situation. It's common for people to require some alone time to recharge. However, the husband's reaction seems to indicate that he might feel unappreciated or not part of the household. The key point here is communication. The author is asking for time to herself, which is reasonable, but the husband is taking it as a rejection or him not being welcome. \n\nThe husband's job situation is also a factor. He works fewer hours and might feel like he's not contributing as much, leading to insecurity. If he's home a lot and the author is working full-time, maybe there's an imbalance in shared responsibilities or social activities. The author's request might not be the issue, but how it's communicated. If she's not validating his feelings or explaining her needs clearly, he might feel hurt. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they see the husband's hurt feelings. However, the author's need for alone time isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be how the request is framed. The husband's response of needing specific hours and what he should do outside seems counterproductive. The author might need to address his feelings first, perhaps through open communication, rather than just making the request. \n\nAnother angle is the housing situation. They can't move, so they have to work with what they have. The author might need to find other ways to create personal space, like setting boundaries even when both are home. Maybe the husband could find hobbies or activities to do while she has her alone time. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting alone time, but the situation points to communication issues. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the core issue is mutual understanding. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, as having alone time is a reasonable need. However, improving how they discuss these needs could help. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
