I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is tight. The author works full-time, and the husband works part-time. The husband feels hurt when asked to leave, saying he doesn't feel welcome. The author values alone time because they used to live alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for personal space is valid, especially in a studio. They mention they can't read or watch shows without feeling the presence of the husband. It's reasonable to want some time alone, especially since they have a full-time job. The husband, on the other hand, has part-time hours and might feel like he's not getting enough time at home. He's also been in the apartment for two years but still doesn't feel it's his home. His reaction might stem from needing validation or feeling like he's not a part of the home.\n\nThe husband's job instability and the housing situation add context. They can't move to a bigger place yet, so the studio is their reality. The author isn't asking for a long time; just a couple of hours. The husband's response seems to be more about feeling rejected rather than the time itself. The author isn't being cruel, just trying to maintain some autonomy. The husband's reaction might be overreacting, but it's possible he's feeling insecure about his role or not having a strong social life.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author's request is reasonable given the living situation. It's a common issue in small spaces. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not belonging, which isn't the author's fault entirely. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
