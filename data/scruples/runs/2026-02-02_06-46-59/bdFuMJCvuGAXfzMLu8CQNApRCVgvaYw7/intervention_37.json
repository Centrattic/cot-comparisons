I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a person who lives in a studio apartment with her husband. They don't have kids, and she works full-time while he works 10-20 hours a week. The key issue is that she wants some alone time, so she sometimes asks him to leave the apartment for a few hours. The problem is that when she does this, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome in his own home. She also mentions that he's home alone a lot anyway, like on Fridays and Mondays, and his job situation is unstable, which is why they can't move to a bigger place yet.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author is valuing her need for personal space, which is important for mental health and well-being. Living in a studio apartment without any privacy can be challenging, and having a job that requires full-time work might mean she needs downtime to recharge. On the other hand, her husband might feel that being asked to leave the home makes him feel like he's not part of the household or that his presence is a burden. His job is part-time and unstable, so he might have feelings of insecurity or low self-esteem, which could be exacerbated by her requests for alone time.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be emotional\u2014he feels hurt and that he's not welcome. The author is trying to find a middle ground by suggesting he do something with friends, but he resists. It's possible he doesn't have a strong social network, or maybe he's not used to being out of the house. The author is trying to balance her need for alone time with his feelings, but the communication seems to be a point of conflict.\n\nThe author isn't wrong in wanting her own space, as everyone needs some time to themselves. However, the way she's approaching it\u2014by making specific requests that make her husband feel unwelcome\u2014might be the issue. Maybe there's a better way to communicate her needs without making him feel like he's being sent away. The husband's reaction also seems a bit over the top, given that he's home alone plenty of other times. There's a communication breakdown here, and both need to work on understanding each other's needs.\n\nConsidering the factors: the author's need for alone time is valid, but the husband's feelings about being in the home shouldn't be dismissed. The fact that they can't move due to financial reasons adds another layer of stress. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's definitely room for both parties to adjust their approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's making repeated requests that hurt his feelings without finding a compromise, she might share some responsibility. But since she's trying to set boundaries for her own well-being, which is important, maybe she's not entirely wrong. The husband's reactions might be more problematic because he's not meeting her needs and is being defensive. Overall, it's a situation where both need to compromise. But the answer options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author is asserting her need for space, which is reasonable, I might lean towards B, but I need to be careful. The key is whether her actions are considered wrong. Since the husband's feelings are valid but his reaction is extreme, the author might not be in the wrong here. So the answer is B.\n"
