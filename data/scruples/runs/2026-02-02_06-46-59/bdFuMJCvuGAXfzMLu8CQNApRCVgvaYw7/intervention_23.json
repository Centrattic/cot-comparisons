I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment. The author, who works full-time, wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband is hurt because he feels it's his home too, and he's not out of the house much. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the living situation. A studio apartment is small, so there's naturally less privacy. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author values alone time, which is understandable. But when she asks him to leave, he feels unwelcome. Maybe he's sensitive because moving in was recent, and he hasn't felt it's his space yet.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to check both sides. The author's reasoning is that she needs time to herself, which is normal. But the husband's reaction is emotional\u2014feeling hurt and questioning what he should do with his time. He might feel like his presence is being rejected. \n\nThe user also mentions that the husband has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday. So, maybe the author is asking for something that's just a couple of hours on a Saturday, which isn't taking away all his time. But the husband's perspective is that if he's home almost all the time, even a few hours of being asked to leave can feel significant. \n\nCommunication seems key here. The author might not be wrong in wanting alone time, but the way she's approaching it might not consider the husband's feelings. Maybe there's a better way to negotiate time apart without making him feel unwelcome. \n\nThe user says the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. It's possible both are right in their own needs. The author's need for alone time is valid, but the husband's feelings about not being included or feeling like the place isn't his might also be valid. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's actions are unreasonable given the circumstances. If the husband isn't using his time productively and the author's request is reasonable for her mental health, then maybe she's not wrong. But if the husband's feelings are being ignored and there's a lack of communication, maybe the author could approach it differently. \n\nIn the end, since the author is asking for her own well-being and the husband's job situation complicates moving, it might not be her fault. But the way she's handling it could be improved. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the husband's reaction is emotional but the author's request is reasonable, maybe she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But wait, maybe the fact that she's not considering his feelings enough makes her in the wrong? Hmm. It's a tough call. Maybe B is correct because both have valid points, but the author's needs are legitimate. So, the answer is B.\n"
