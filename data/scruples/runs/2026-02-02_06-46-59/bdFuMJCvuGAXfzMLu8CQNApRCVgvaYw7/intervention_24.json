I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author (the wife) values alone time, which is understandable. Studio apartments are small, so having someone else around all the time can be stressful. She mentions she works full-time, while he works less and spends more time at home. She's trying to get some personal space, which is a reasonable need. People do need alone time to recharge, so her request makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is feeling that the apartment isn't his home anymore. He's being asked to leave, even though he's the one living there. His feelings of not being welcome could be valid. He might feel that his presence is burdensome, especially if he's already spending a lot of time at home. The way he reacts\u2014getting hurt and wanting specific hours\u2014might indicate that he's struggling with the situation emotionally.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The wife's need for alone time is legitimate, but the husband's feelings about his home shouldn't be dismissed. The problem might be that their communication isn't effective. She asks him to leave, and he feels it's not his home, which is a valid emotional response. However, the solution might involve finding a middle ground, like having quiet time together, or other ways to create space without making him feel unwelcome.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's fair. The wife's actions (asking for alone time) aren't inherently wrong. The issue is more about how their needs are being met and communicated. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling excluded, which is a different problem. The right approach might be for both to discuss their needs and find a compromise, rather than one being wrong.\n\nConsidering the context, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time. The problem is a mismatch in expectations and communication. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
