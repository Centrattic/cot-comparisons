I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The wife works full-time, while her husband works 10-20 hours a week. She wants some alone time, but when she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also points out that he's home alone a lot and doesn't have many social activities. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues related to his job.\n\nThe key points here are about personal space needs and communication. The wife is asking for time alone, which is a common need, but the husband is taking it as a rejection. The husband feels like he's not part of the home because he's been there for two years but it's still not his place. His job is unstable, so moving isn't an option yet.\n\nI should consider if the wife is overstepping. Studio apartments are small, so having alone time can be challenging. However, the husband's reaction seems to be emotional, possibly feeling that his presence is a burden. The wife is not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. It's reasonable to need solitude, especially with work. \n\nBut maybe there's a communication issue. Instead of asking him to leave, maybe they could find a better way to spend time apart, like using noise-canceling headphones or having different activities in the same space. However, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong for asking him to leave. \n\nGiven that the husband has a lot of free time and the wife's need for alone time is valid, it's not entirely her fault. The husband's reaction and lack of social engagement might be contributing factors. The wife isn't being unreasonable; she's trying to balance her needs with their living situation. The answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong (B).\n"
