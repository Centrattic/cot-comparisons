I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living in a studio apartment. The author wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours, but he feels hurt and unwelcome. The husband works part-time and spends a lot of time at home, which the author finds limiting her personal space. They can't move to a bigger place due to financial instability.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The wife is requesting personal time, which is a valid need. Many people value alone time, especially in a small living space. The husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling that his presence is not wanted, which could indicate a sensitivity to being excluded. However, the husband also has a history of not going out much or seeing friends, which might contribute to his discomfort when asked to spend time away.\n\nThe wife's request isn't unreasonable. She's not asking him to leave all the time, just occasionally for a few hours. The husband's response, getting hurt and demanding specifics, might be an overreaction. The fact that he has free time on other days (like Friday and Monday) but still feels the weekend is his only relaxing time suggests he might be prioritizing his own needs over hers, which isn't fair if it's causing the wife stress.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent them from moving, so the problem isn't that they can't find a bigger place. The wife is trying to manage their current situation by carving out personal time. The husband's feelings of unwelcome might be more about his own habits of staying home rather than the actual request. It's important to balance both partners' needs in a relationship. The wife isn't being inconsiderate; she's setting a boundary for her well-being. The husband's reaction seems more about his own feelings of exclusion rather than the request itself. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
