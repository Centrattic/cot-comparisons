I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they live in a studio apartment with their husband, and they want some alone time. The husband works part-time, so he's around more. The author asks him to leave for a few hours on the weekend, but he gets upset and feels unwelcome. The author values alone time, but the husband seems to be taking it as a rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to personal space, especially since they used to live alone and value that. A studio apartment doesn't have much privacy, so wanting some time to themselves isn't unreasonable. On the other hand, the husband might feel that being asked to leave is a sign that the author doesn't want him around, which could hurt his feelings. Especially if he's not used to the apartment feeling like home yet, maybe he's more sensitive about it.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author isn't asking for a lot of time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband's job is unstable, so maybe he doesn't have many social activities, making him rely more on being at home. But that doesn't mean the author should have to sacrifice their need for alone time. Also, the author points out that he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday, so maybe the weekend is the only time he feels like he can relax. However, the author's request is for a specific time, not all the time.\n\nThe husband's response of needing specific hours and what he should do outside seems like he's trying to set boundaries but also maybe not understanding the author's request. The author is not asking for him to be gone all weekend, just a part of it. The husband's feeling that the apartment isn't his yet might contribute to his sensitivity, but that doesn't negate the author's needs. \n\nIn terms of moving to a bigger apartment, financial constraints are a real issue, so that's a valid point. The author is not in the wrong for wanting some space, especially since it's clear they communicate their needs and the husband's reaction is more about his feelings of rejection than the request itself. The key is that the author is being reasonable but the husband is taking it as a personal attack. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
