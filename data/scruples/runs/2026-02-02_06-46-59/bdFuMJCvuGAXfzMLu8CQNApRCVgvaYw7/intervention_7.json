I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment, and the author wants some alone time by asking her husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome in his own home. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since she worked full-time and the husband works less. Studio apartments are known for being cramped, so having no alone time could be really stressful. She's not avoiding him, just needing some time to herself. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is feeling excluded. He's living there, so he might feel that the home isn't his if he's constantly asked to leave. It's possible he's hurt because he might feel he's not being included or appreciated. Also, he's mentioned his job situation is unstable, which adds to the stress of the situation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the issue is communication. The husband seems to want to understand the exact time and reasons, which might indicate he's trying to adjust but feels unclear. Maybe the author didn't communicate her needs clearly, leading to hurt feelings. Alternatively, the husband might not be respecting her need for space.\n\nI should also consider the context: they live in a big city with housing issues, so moving isn't an option right now. The author is trying to manage within the current situation. The husband's reaction might be more about feeling unappreciated or insecure in the relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's asking for what she needs, but the way she's doing it makes the husband feel unwelcome. Maybe she should talk to him about her needs in a more empathetic way, rather than just asking him to leave. But is that making her in the wrong? Or is the husband's reaction the problem here?\n\nHmm. If both parties have valid needs, maybe the problem is mutual. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's being considerate but the husband is overreacting, then she's not wrong. If her request is reasonable but the communication is lacking, then maybe there's room for improvement, but not necessarily being in the wrong. The husband's feelings are important too. \n\nI think the key is whether asking for a few hours alone is unreasonable. Since it's a studio apartment and they both are home a lot, it's understandable. But the husband's response suggests deeper issues. The author isn't doing anything wrong per se; she's expressing her need, but perhaps she needs to address his feelings as well. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
