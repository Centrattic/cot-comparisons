I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is the wife asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a few hours to have some alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why she needs that time when he has free days. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, consider the context. They live in a studio apartment with no separate rooms, so alone time is hard when both are home. The wife works full-time, while the husband works part-time. She values her alone time, which is understandable. The husband, on the other hand, feels like the apartment isn't his home and gets hurt when she asks him to leave. He also mentions not having friends to hang out with when she asks.\n\nIs it fair for the wife to ask for time alone? Yes, because everyone needs personal space. But maybe she's not considering his feelings. The husband's reaction seems a bit hypersensitive. He's home a lot and has free days, so maybe he could find other activities or friends. However, he might feel neglected or not part of the household. The fact that he says it's not his home yet might indicate he's struggling with the transition into shared living.\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, which adds stress. Maybe financial issues are making him more sensitive. The wife wants to move to a bigger place but can't right now. So, she's trying to manage with what they have. Her request for alone time is reasonable, but she could approach it with more empathy. The husband's reaction is also valid because he feels unwelcome. It's a mutual issue where both need to communicate better.\n\nUltimately, the wife isn't wrong for needing space, but the way she's handling it might be. The husband's feelings are valid too. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think it's a balance. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because everyone needs alone time, but there's room for improvement in how both parties handle the situation. The husband's feelings are important, but the wife isn't wrong for seeking her needs.\n"
