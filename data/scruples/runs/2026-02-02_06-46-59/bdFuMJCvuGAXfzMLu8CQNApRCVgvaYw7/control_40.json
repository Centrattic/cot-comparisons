I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the context: They live in a studio apartment, which is small. The husband works only 10-20 hours a week and doesn't go out much, so he's home a lot. The wife works full-time and values alone time. She wants a couple hours to herself on weekends. She's asked him to leave, but he feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome. They can't move to a bigger place right now due to financial issues.\n\nSo, the main issue is the balance between personal space and feeling included. The wife is asking for something reasonable\u2014hours to herself that she's used to when living alone. The husband, however, is taking it personally and not considering that she needs this for her well-being. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The husband might feel that his presence is being rejected, especially if he's not getting out much. However, the wife isn't rejecting him; she just needs time for herself. The husband's reaction seems more about his feelings of not being welcome rather than understanding her need.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving, so the wife has to find another solution. Is asking him to leave for a few hours really unreasonable? She's not asking him to do something harmful; just to be away for a couple hours so she can have space. The husband's response seems to be about his feelings being hurt rather than compromising.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's job situation is unstable, and maybe he's not used to being home a lot. But he does have free time, and she's giving him options like meeting friends. If he can't do that, maybe he should find other activities. The wife's request seems valid as she's adjusting to living together in a small space, something she wasn't used to before.\n\nThe key here is whether the request is reasonable. Since the husband is home a lot and the wife is working, needing alone time isn't unreasonable. The husband's reaction might be stemming from insecurity or feeling neglected, but that doesn't mean the wife is wrong to ask for her space. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
