I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment where both live, and the husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time, but when they ask, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the studio apartment leading to no alone time, the husband's job situation being unstable, and the author wanting some space. The author's reasoning is that having a studio apartment means no privacy, and they value their alone time. The husband's reaction is feeling unwelcome when he's asked to leave. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have a valid need for personal space. Living in a small space without privacy can be stressful. They mention they work full-time, while the husband works fewer hours, so he's home more. The author is not asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours on a Saturday to be alone. It's reasonable for someone to want some time to themselves, especially in a shared living situation.\n\nOn the husband's side, he might feel that the author is dismissing his presence or not valuing his time. When asked to leave, he might interpret it as being unwanted. His job instability and financial situation add stress; moving to a bigger apartment isn't feasible right now. He might feel like the only time he can relax is over the weekend, and the author's request takes that away. His hurt feelings could stem from feeling like he's not part of the home or that his needs aren't being considered.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated. The author is asking for a reasonable amount of time alone, which is a basic need. However, communication is key here. The author could have approached the request differently, perhaps explaining the need for alone time and checking in with the husband's feelings. But the husband's response of feeling unwelcome and wanting specific hours seems overly possessive. The author didn't do anything wrong by asking for personal time, especially in a situation where they live in a small space. The husband's job situation and lack of social activities might contribute to his needing to be home, but the author's need for privacy is also valid. The problem might stem from how the request is communicated rather than the request itself. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but there's room for better communication and compromise between both parties.\n"
