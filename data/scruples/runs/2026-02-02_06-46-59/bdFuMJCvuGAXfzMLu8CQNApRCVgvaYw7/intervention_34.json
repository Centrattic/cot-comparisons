I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment. The author wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours, but he gets hurt and doesn't feel welcome. She's considering moving to a bigger place but they can't afford it right now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since they live in a small studio. She works full-time and he works part-time, so their schedules might overlap more. It's reasonable to want some time alone to recharge. However, the husband's reaction is important too. He feels that his presence is making her uncomfortable, and he might feel like he's not part of the home they live in. His job is unstable, which adds stress, and maybe he's using the time at home as a way to cope.\n\nThe author's request isn't unreasonable, but the way she's handling it might be the issue. Instead of just asking him to leave, maybe communication is lacking. Perhaps she hasn't expressed her needs in a way that he understands or feels supported. The husband's hurt feelings suggest he might feel excluded or unappreciated. \n\nAlso, the fact that they can't move to a bigger apartment yet is a real constraint. They might need to find compromises, like setting specific times for alone space and shared time. The author might not be wrong in wanting alone time, but maybe she's not considering his feelings enough. It's a balance between personal needs and mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her need for space is valid, but there's room for improvement in how she communicates with her husband. The problem isn't entirely hers, and the husband's reaction also has valid points. Neither is entirely wrong; they both need to adjust.\n"
