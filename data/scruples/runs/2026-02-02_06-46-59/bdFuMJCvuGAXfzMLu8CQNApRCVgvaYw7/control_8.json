I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife feels the need to ask her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, and there's some tension about their living situation and his job stability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He moved in two years ago and might still be adjusting. The wife wants alone time, which is reasonable, especially since they live in a small space. But she's asking him to leave, which he interprets as not being welcome. The husband works fewer hours, so he's home more, which could lead to him feeling like he's always on the clock. The problem is communication\u2014she wants alone time, but he's taking it personally.\n\nThe wife's reasoning is that she values alone time, and given the studio apartment, it's hard to have it. She's not asking for a lot; just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unappreciated or maybe insecure. He's pointing out that he's home alone on other days, but maybe he's not used to being alone and feels the request is unfair compared to his time alone. \n\nThe financial aspect complicates things. They can't move to a bigger place right now due to his unstable job. So the wife can't just fix the space issue, which adds pressure on their current living arrangements. The husband's job situation might contribute to his stress, making him more sensitive about being asked to leave.\n\nThe key here is whether the request is reasonable. The wife is asking for a specific, short period of time, not constant separation. It's normal to need personal space. The husband's reaction seems emotional and possibly defensive. If the wife had communicated her needs without making him feel excluded, maybe it would help. But she's clear about needing alone time for her own well-being. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife isn't being unreasonable. She's addressing a personal need in a small living space. The husband's feelings are valid, but his response might be overreacting. The problem is more about communication and mutual understanding. The wife isn't in the wrong for needing space, especially when they have the means to do it occasionally (like during a day trip where he's already out). The husband needs to take responsibility for his reaction and perhaps find ways to manage his time better when she's unavailable. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
