I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio, so space is limited. The author works full-time, while the husband works part-time. The husband is home a lot, and when the author asks him to leave to have alone time, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They value alone time, which is understandable. Living in a studio without kids, the lack of personal space can be stressful. The husband's job is unstable, so maybe he feels the home is his refuge. But the author is trying to maintain their own need for personal space, which is a valid boundary.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unappreciated or not part of the home. He might feel like he's not accepted there, especially since he moved into the author's apartment. The emotional response (\"hurt\") might stem from feelings of insecurity or not being valued in the relationship. However, expecting someone to find activities just so the other person can have alone time might be a communication issue.\n\nThe author isn't asking the husband to leave all the time, just occasionally. The husband has free time on other days, so maybe the problem is about specific days when he wants to spend time. The author's request is reasonable, but the husband's reaction seems exaggerated. However, the husband's feelings are real, so the author needs to address that without dismissing them.\n\nMaybe the author should communicate better, explain the need for alone time without making it about the husband's actions. Also, finding a compromise, like scheduling specific times or suggesting activities for him on those days. The root issue might be about boundaries and mutual understanding rather than one person being wrong.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid needs. The author isn't in the wrong for needing alone time, but maybe could approach the request differently. The husband's reaction might stem from deeper insecurities. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with the need for better communication and compromise.\n"
