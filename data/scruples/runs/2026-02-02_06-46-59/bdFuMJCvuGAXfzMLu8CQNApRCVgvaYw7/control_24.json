I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment, so there's no privacy. The wife works full-time, and the husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week). He's home most of the time, and she wants some alone time, so she asks him to go out for a couple of hours on Saturday. But when she does that, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his home. She's also considering moving to a bigger place but can't due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The wife is asking for personal space, which is a common need. The husband, on the other hand, feels that his presence is unwelcome when he's not working much. The key points here are about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. The husband's job situation is unstable, so he has limited income, making relocation hard. The wife values alone time, which is valid because living in a studio without privacy can be stressful.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit extreme. He's home a lot and has free time, but when asked to leave for a few hours, he feels hurt and defensive. Maybe he feels insecure about not having a job that keeps him busy, or he's struggling with the idea of the apartment not feeling like his home. The wife is trying to balance her need for alone time with his feelings. She's not asking him to move out permanently but just for a couple of hours. However, the husband's response suggests that he might not be respecting her need for personal space, or he's using the situation to express deeper issues, like feeling disconnected from the home.\n\nFinancial constraints are a factor here. They can't move to a bigger place right now, so the studio is their reality. The wife is asking for something reasonable: a few hours of privacy. The husband's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't necessarily mean the wife is wrong. It's more about communication. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like the husband finding other ways to occupy himself without going out, or the wife setting aside specific times for alone time. However, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong for making the request. Since she's not being abusive or unreasonable, and the husband's job situation doesn't exempt him from needing to respect her space, the wife is probably not in the wrong. The husband's feelings are valid but need to be addressed through better communication, not by invalidating her request for alone time.\n"
