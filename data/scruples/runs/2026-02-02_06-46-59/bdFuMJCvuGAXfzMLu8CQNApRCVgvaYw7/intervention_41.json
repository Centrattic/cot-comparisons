I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both perspectives. The wife values her alone time and mentions the studio apartment's lack of privacy. She works full-time, and he works part-time. He doesn't have many social activities and is home a lot. She wants some personal time, which is understandable. People often need space, especially in a small living environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband seems to take her request personally. When she asks him to leave, he reacts with hurt feelings and questions the exact duration and his activities. He also ties her request to the upcoming day trip, implying that without Saturday time, his weekend isn't relaxing. His job is unstable, so moving isn't feasible now, adding to his stress perhaps.\n\nThe wife's reasoning: She's trying to maintain her mental well-being by having alone time. The husband's reaction might be from feeling excluded or unappreciated. Maybe he feels that the home isn't his, leading to insecurity. The key here is communication. Is her request reasonable, or is she not considering his feelings?\n\nFactors to consider: The wife's need for personal space is valid, especially in a studio apartment. But the husband's emotional response might stem from deeper issues like feeling that he's not part of the home. The fact that he's home a lot and doesn't have many friends could mean he feels isolated, so being asked to leave might exacerbate that loneliness.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong? Probably not. She's addressing her need for space, which is a normal request. However, the way she communicates it might be a problem. If she's not considering how he feels or not setting boundaries that are respectful to both, that could be an issue. But from the description, she seems to be asking for time without being dismissive of his presence.\n\nThe husband's reaction is disproportionate. Feeling unwelcome if asked to leave for a few hours isn't fair, especially if there's no communication about the reasons behind the request. The wife might need to explain her need for space better, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong for needing it.\n\nThe fact that they can't move due to financial reasons adds another layer. The wife might have accepted a living situation that's challenging for both. But she's trying to adapt by asking for time. The husband's response might be more about his own issues with the living arrangement and insecurity rather than the actual request.\n\nIn conclusion, the wife isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. The answer should be B (No).\n"
