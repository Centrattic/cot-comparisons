I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is a studio apartment where both live, and the husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author values alone time because they used to live alone and need that space. The husband reacts hurt and feels it's not his home anymore when she asks him to leave.\n\nFirst, the author's request seems reasonable. They need personal time, which is important for mental health. The husband's reaction is more about feeling unwelcome, but he's home all the time anyway. The author isn't keeping him away from work or essential activities; just asking for a few hours on a weekend. The husband's job is unstable, so maybe he doesn't have many opportunities to socialize, but that's his own situation. The author isn't obligated to provide him with friends or activities. \n\nAlso, the husband has been in the apartment for two years and still doesn't feel it's his home. That might indicate a deeper issue about his attachment or the dynamics of their living arrangement. The author's need for space is valid, especially since they mentioned they work full-time and need alone time. The husband's response seems more about his own feelings of insecurity or lack of social life rather than the author being unreasonable.\n\nThe author isn't refusing him entry into the home permanently, just for a few hours. The husband's job instability and financial issues are separate from the current request. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The problem is about communication and differing needs, but the author's request is justified.\n"
