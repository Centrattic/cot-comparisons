I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, no kids, the husband works part-time. The author wants some alone time because they value it, but the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, which is important for mental health. Living in a small space with someone all the time can be draining. The husband's reaction is about feeling like he doesn't belong, maybe feeling rejected when asked to leave. But the husband has plenty of free time and isn't going out much. The author is trying to balance their needs without moving, which is hard because of financial reasons.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, everyone has a right to personal space. The husband's hurt feelings are valid, but the author isn't trying to exclude him all the time. The problem might be communication. They need to find a middle ground, like specific times for alone space and compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asking for a few hours. The husband needs to find his own activities. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
