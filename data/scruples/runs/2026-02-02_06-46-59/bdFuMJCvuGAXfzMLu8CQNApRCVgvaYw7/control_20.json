I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no privacy, and the husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time, but when they ask, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user is asking if the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially working full-time. A studio apartment can be tough for two people to have alone time. It's reasonable to want a few hours to oneself. On the other hand, the husband might feel that his presence is being rejected or that the home isn't his. But the author isn't saying he can't be there at all; just for a couple of hours on a specific day.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. If he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday, maybe he can use that time. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple hours. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs. The author isn't being mean or unreasonable. The husband's job situation and financial constraints are part of the problem, but that doesn't negate the author's need for space. The key here is communication and finding a compromise. The author isn't wrong for wanting some alone time. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
