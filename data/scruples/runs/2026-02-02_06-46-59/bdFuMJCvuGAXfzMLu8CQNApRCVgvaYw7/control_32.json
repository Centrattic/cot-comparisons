I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. The situation is a studio apartment with no alone time, the husband works part-time and isn't out much, and when the author asks for some alone time, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. Also, the author mentions financial issues preventing a move to a bigger place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants alone time, which is a reasonable need. People often need personal space, especially in a small living situation. The husband's reaction seems emotional, feeling that being asked to leave means he's not welcome. But he's home a lot, and the author is just asking for a few hours of privacy. \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. They can't move because of his job instability and high housing costs. So the conflict is about balancing personal space needs with the current living constraints. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's right to privacy vs. the husband's feelings of not being included. The husband's response seems to be taking the request too personally, maybe projecting his own feelings about the living situation onto the author's request. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. It's reasonable to ask for some alone time, especially when it's affecting their well-being. The husband's reaction is more about his own insecurities or lack of personal time as well. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is healthy. The husband's response is problematic because he's making it about being unwelcome rather than addressing the actual issue of needing to find a compromise. \n\nAlso, the author is working full-time, so having some time to relax without the husband around is understandable. The husband's free time isn't being utilized much beyond today and Monday, but he's upset about a Saturday afternoon. Maybe he's not managing his own time well or socializing enough. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's request is valid. The husband's hurt feelings are a reaction to the request, possibly because of underlying issues like feeling isolated or not part of the home. The author isn't wrong for wanting alone time, especially in a situation where moving isn't an option yet. The problem might be more about communication and the husband's emotional response rather than the author's initial request.\n"
