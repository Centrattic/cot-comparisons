I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is justified in asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They live in a studio apartment, which is small. Both work, but the husband works fewer hours and spends a lot of time at home. The author values alone time, which is hard with him around. She's asked him to go out to have some time to herself, but he feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome. The husband is sensitive about being asked to leave, interpreting it as not his home. They can't move to a bigger place yet due to financial issues.\n\nSo, the main points are about personal space in a shared living situation. The author wants alone time, which is reasonable. But the husband feels rejected when asked to leave. The challenge is balancing both partners' needs. \n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong, but I need to evaluate. Is asking for a few hours of privacy unreasonable? In a studio apartment, there's no separation, so maybe it's necessary. However, the husband's reaction suggests he takes it personally, which could indicate communication issues. The author isn't being mean, just stating her needs. The husband's feelings might stem from not feeling included or insecure about his role. \n\nBut the author's request is for her mental well-being, which is valid. The problem might be how the request is communicated or the husband's inability to cope with being alone. However, the author is not being inconsiderate; she's looking for a solution. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that doesn't negate her need for space. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong for needing time alone. The husband might need to work on his feelings of insecurity. The answer isn't clear-cut, but the author's actions are justified. So I think the correct response is B (not in the wrong).\n"
