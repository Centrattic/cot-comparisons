I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They live in a studio apartment, which is small and doesn't offer much privacy. The author works full-time, and her husband works part-time, so he's home more often. The author values alone time and sometimes wants to be alone, which leads her to ask her husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband, however, feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome in his own home. He also gets upset when she asks for specific hours and activities.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault here. Let's break it down. The author's request is about needing personal space, which is a common human need. Studio apartments can be challenging because of the lack of privacy. The husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unwelcome, even though he's home a lot. But the author isn't asking him to leave every day; just sometimes, like a few hours on a Saturday. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place yet. That adds pressure on both sides. The author isn't trying to exclude him all the time but needs some space. The husband's response seems a bit over the top, especially since he's home alone on other days, like Fridays and Mondays. \n\nI think the key points here are mutual needs. The author has a valid need for alone time, and the husband's emotional reaction is problematic. He needs to find ways to occupy himself or socialize on his own. The fact that he's not working much might contribute to his feeling of needing constant presence. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her space, especially in a small living situation. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her personal space, which is reasonable. The husband needs to adjust and find ways to manage his time and emotions.\n"
