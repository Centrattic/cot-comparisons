I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThey live in a studio apartment, which means no privacy. She needs alone time because she values being alone and used to living alone. Her husband works part-time and is home a lot, not going out much. When she asks him to leave so she can have time to herself, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. He also asks for exact hours and what he should do, which seems like he's not okay with the request. She's trying to have a day trip on Sunday and he's upset if he can't be home on Saturday too. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues related to his unstable job.\n\nSo, the main points are her need for personal time versus his feelings of not being welcome. She's not being unreasonable by asking for some alone time, especially since they live in a small space. It's common for people to need personal space, and she's not denying him a home; she's just wanting time to herself. His reaction seems to stem from feeling excluded or not valued. The fact that he's home a lot and she's working full-time adds to the dynamic. The financial constraints make moving not an option right now, so they have to find a middle ground. The key here is communication. She's not wrong for needing space, but maybe both need to work on how they communicate their needs. The husband's response is a bit over the top, as he has plenty of free time. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
