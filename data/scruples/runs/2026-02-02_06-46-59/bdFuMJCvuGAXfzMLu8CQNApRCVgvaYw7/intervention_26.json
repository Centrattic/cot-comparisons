I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio, which is a small space with no privacy. The author works full time, and her husband works part-time, so he's around more. She wants some alone time because she's used to living alone.\n\nThe husband gets hurt when she asks him to leave, saying he doesn't feel welcome. He's also confused about how many hours she needs and what to do when his friends aren't available. The author is frustrated because he's home a lot and she can't get her alone time. They can't move because of financial issues.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about needing personal space versus the husband feeling unwelcome. The author is justified in wanting alone time, especially since she values it and the living situation is cramped. But the way she's handling it might be part of the problem. Maybe she's not considering his feelings enough. The husband feels his presence is an issue, which is valid too. Both need to communicate better. But is she in the wrong? Well, asking for a few hours alone isn't unreasonable. The problem might be in how she's communicating it or not addressing his feelings. Maybe she should find a middle ground, like suggesting activities he can do alone or together. But the core issue is the studio apartment causing lack of privacy, which is a real problem. The author isn't wrong for wanting alone time, so the answer is probably B.\n"
