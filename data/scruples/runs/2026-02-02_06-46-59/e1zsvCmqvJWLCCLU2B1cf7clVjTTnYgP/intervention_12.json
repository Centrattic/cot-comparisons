I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let me read through the scenario again to understand both sides.\n\nThe author and their friend have been close since forever. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend does not. The friend has been invited on family vacations, received gifts, and even a car from the author's parents. The author graduated without debt because their great-grandpa covered it, while the friend has over $50k in debt. The author moved out at 18, and the friend still lives with her parents at 26. The author offered to let the friend live with them, but the friend refused because of her dog, which the author is allergic to. \n\nNow, the friend works in the author's family business, doing a warehouse job that's under her skill level. The author defends the friend at work despite her mistakes but the friend starts blaming the author for her errors, which the author attributes to their medical issues. The friend then accuses the author of faking depression and being a leech, spreading negativity. The author wants to cut ties but knows that stopping support might lead to the friend losing her job and financial help.\n\nSo, the author is questioning if they're in the wrong by cutting off the friend, even though they know it might hurt her financially.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. They've been generous, provided opportunities, and defended the friend despite her shortcomings. They have their own medical issues and are struggling to manage their responsibilities. The friend's behavior has turned toxic, spreading lies and being ungrateful. The author is protecting themselves from the friend's negativity and is considering ending the friendship, even if it means the friend loses her job. \n\nOn the friend's side, she's in a tough spot financially and perhaps feels resentful. She might feel that the author's support isn't enough or that she's being taken advantage of. However, her actions\u2014spreading rumors, blaming the author, and being unkind\u2014seem to be justified as hostile. The friend's resentment might stem from feeling unappreciated or from personal insecurities, but that doesn't excuse her behavior towards the author.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's toxic behavior and the author's right to self-preservation. The author is not obligated to maintain a friendship that is harmful to them. While the author's decision might impact the friend's job, the friend is an employee now, and the parents are the ones who hired her. The author's role in that is minimal; they were advocating for her before, but if the friend is underperforming, the parents might have to make a decision regardless of the friendship status. \n\nThe author isn't the one responsible for the friend's financial situation. The friend chose to work in a position that doesn't suit her skills, and her mistakes are costing the business. The author's medical issues are legitimate and beyond their control. The friend's accusations are unfounded and malicious. \n\nSo, the author is within their rights to end the friendship, especially after the friend's betrayal and negativity. The author isn't at fault for wanting to protect their own well-being. The friend's actions have contributed to the breakdown of the relationship, not the author's generosity or support. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
