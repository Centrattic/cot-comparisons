I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between two friends where one is more privileged and the other is struggling. The author comes from a well-off family, has been given a lot (vacations, gifts, a car), and has an easy life with no debt. The friend, on the other hand, is in debt, can't afford to move out, and works in the author's family business. The friend is now ressentful, blaming the author for her mistakes and spreading negative things about her.\n\nThe author is dealing with medical and personal issues, which have affected their availability as a friend. They've tried to defend the friend at work but now feel the friend is being a jerk. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that without the family support, the friend might lose her job soon.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The friend's resentment might be due to feeling taken advantage of or jealous of the author's privileges. The author might feel that the friend is ungrateful, especially since they've provided a lot of support. But when the friend starts spreading rumors and acting hostile, that's a problem.\n\nThe author is in a position of power, both socially and professionally. The friend's job depends on the author's parents. If the author ends the friendship, the friend could lose her job, which might be a harsh consequence. Is it fair for the author to cut off a friend who's also an employee, especially if the friend's behavior is unkind but perhaps rooted in her own struggles?\n\nThe author's decision to stop being friends might be justified if the friend is toxic. However, considering the friend is also an employee, the author's action could be seen as using her position to retaliate or end the friendship, which might not be fair. Also, the friend's comments about the author being a leech and attention-seeker are hurtful and need to be addressed.\n\nBut the author is also facing her own challenges and might feel overwhelmed. She tried to help the friend by offering a job and has defended her at work. The friend's behavior is clearly crossing lines, so the author has a right to distance herself. However, the potential fallout for the friend could be severe if the author's parents stop supporting her. That's a big consequence.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether cutting the friendship is a reasonable response to the friend's toxic behavior. The friend's actions are unkind and unprofessional, which the author has a right to be upset about. But the author's decision might affect the friend's livelihood, which complicates things. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the friendship, given the friend's actions. However, she should consider the impact on the friend's job. Maybe she could try to mediate or talk to her parents, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the friend was the one spreading rumors and acting out, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
