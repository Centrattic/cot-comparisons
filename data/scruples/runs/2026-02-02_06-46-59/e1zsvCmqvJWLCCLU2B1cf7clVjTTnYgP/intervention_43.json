I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between two friends who've been close for a long time. The author comes from a well-off family, and the friend does not. The friend has been given a lot by the author's family\u2014vacations, gifts, a car. The author even offered her a place to live. The friend now works in the author's family business, but she's making mistakes, and the author is trying to defend her. The friend is acting resentful, blaming the author for her problems, and spreading negative things. The author wants to cut ties, but is worried about the friend losing her job and support from the family.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is whether the author did anything to deserve this treatment. The author mentions that they've been generous, offered help, and tried to defend the friend's work performance despite her mistakes. The author has health issues, which might slow down some tasks, but the friend is blaming them. The friend's behavior seems toxic\u2014spreading rumors, being nice to the author's face but trash-talking behind their back. The author is done and wants to end the friendship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to check. Let me break it down. The author has given a lot to the friend. The friend is showing ingratitude and resentment. The author is trying to be supportive despite personal struggles. The friend's actions are unkind and untrue. The author is justified in cutting ties because the friend is toxic and unappreciative. However, the author is aware that their family supports the friend's job, so ending the friendship might lead to the friend losing her job. But the author isn't the one deciding her job status\u2014her work performance is the issue. The author's decision to stop being friends is a personal choice, and they\u2019re not wrong for wanting to protect their mental health. The friend's actions are the main issue here. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author isn't responsible for the friend's resentment and is justified in ending the toxic relationship.\n"
