I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend who's been acting resentful and spreading negative things about the author. The author feels they've been generous, giving the friend family vacations, gifts, a car, job opportunities, etc. The friend now blames the author for not being supportive enough at work and has started badmouthing them. The author wants to cut ties but is worried about the friend losing job support from their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is in a privileged position financially and has offered help, like the job and the living arrangement. However, the friend turned down the living offer due to her dog, which the author is allergic to. The friend's actions, like spreading rumors and blaming the author for her mistakes, seem toxic. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might affect their work performance, but the friend accuses them of faking it to get attention.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's resentment and the author's generosity. The author isn't necessarily responsible for the friend's mistakes at work, especially since the friend is being defensive. The author's decision to end the friendship might be justified given the friend's hostile behavior. However, the author is aware that cutting ties could lead to the friend losing job support, which complicates things. But the author isn't responsible for the friend's job security; that's up to the parents and the business. The author's main issue is the friend's toxic behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the friend's issues more directly before cutting off. But given the friend's actions, it's understandable the author wants to end the friendship. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their own well-being and distance from a toxic person. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
