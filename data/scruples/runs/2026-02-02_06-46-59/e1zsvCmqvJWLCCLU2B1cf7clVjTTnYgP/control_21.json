I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is at fault.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, while their friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, even a car from the author's parents. The author managed to graduate debt-free thanks to their great-grandpa's funding, while the friend has over $50k in debt. The friend is still living with her parents at 26. The author offered her a place to stay in their home, but the friend declined because of her dog, which the author is allergic to.\n\nThe author works in their family's business and has a medical condition and depression, which affects their work. The friend works in the warehouse, makes mistakes, and the author defends her despite this. The friend is resentful, blames the author for her work issues, and starts spreading negative things about the author, calling them spoiled and a leech. The author now wants to cut ties, knowing that doing so might lead to the friend losing her job and financial support from the family. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n1. The author is in a better financial position and has provided support (vacations, gifts, job).\n2. The friend has financial struggles, debt, and work issues.\n3. The friend is resentful and starts spreading negativity, while the author defends her despite her mistakes.\n4. The author is dealing with personal issues (depression, medical problems) which affect their work performance slightly.\n5. The friend is angry, accuses the author of being faking her depression and being a leech, and spreads this to others.\n6. The author wants to end the friendship, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job and support.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main ethical consideration here is whether the author has done something to deserve the friend's behavior, or if the friend's resentment and actions make the author the victim.\n\nThe friend's actions seem to be the main issue here. She is spreading lies and negative comments, which is unkind and harmful. The author, despite the friend's financial struggles, has offered support (the home, the job). The author is defending the friend at work, even when the friend is making mistakes. The friend, however, is not reciprocating and is instead turning on the author. The friend's resentment might be due to feeling entitled to the author's support or being envious of their better circumstances, but that doesn't justify her behavior.\n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship is a personal choice. Given that the friend is spreading harmful lies and being toxic, it's reasonable for the author to cut ties. Even though the author knows that this might lead to the friend losing her job, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that is being harmful. The author's mental health and well-being are important, and dealing with a toxic friend while managing their own health issues is difficult.\n\nHowever, the author's parents are the ones who hired the friend. The author might be worried that ending the friendship will lead to the friend being fired, but the author isn't directly responsible for the friend's job. The friend's performance issues are her own problem, and if she's not performing well, the parents might have already considered letting her go regardless of the friendship.\n\nIs the author at fault for ending the friendship? Probably not. The friend's actions are the main problem here. The author has supported her in various ways, but the friend's toxic behavior justifies cutting ties. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own well-being and ending a relationship that's become harmful.\n"
