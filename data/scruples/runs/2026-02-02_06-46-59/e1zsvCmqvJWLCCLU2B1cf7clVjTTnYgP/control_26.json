I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and her friend have been close for a long time, like family. The author comes from a wealthy family, and her friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, even a car from the author's parents. The author has a much easier life in terms of school and debt, while the friend has over $50k in debt and struggles. The friend is still living with her parents, and when the author offered to let her live with her, the friend declined because of her dog and allergies.\n\nNow, the friend works in the author's family business. The author's parents offered her a job in the warehouse that pays more than they intended. Since starting there, their friendship has deteriorated. The author has been dealing with medical issues and depression, leading to less social interaction. The friend has been making mistakes at work, and the author defends her. However, the friend is blaming the author's slower work (due to her medical condition) for her mistakes. The friend has become resentful, spreading negative things about the author to others, including calling her a leech and a spoiled person. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that her parents might then let the friend go because she's not performing well.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. The author has been supportive, offering financial help through her parents, a job, and even a place to live. She's defending the friend's mistakes at work. The friend, on the other hand, is acting out, spreading rumors, and being resentful despite the support. The author's reasons for ending the friendship are because of the friend's toxic behavior, not because she wanted to hurt her. The friend's actions seem to be driven by jealousy and resentment, possibly due to the author's better circumstances.\n\nThe author's decision to stop being friends could be seen as self-preservation, given the friend's harmful behavior. The friend is not taking responsibility for her actions and is instead blaming the author. The author is not cutting ties for selfish reasons but because the friend's behavior is toxic and the friendship is no longer healthy. The potential consequence of the friend losing her job is a result of her performance, not the author's direct action. The author's parents might have made that decision regardless if they weren't getting good performance.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author has done a lot to support her friend, but the friend's response is unjust. The right choice is B.\n"
