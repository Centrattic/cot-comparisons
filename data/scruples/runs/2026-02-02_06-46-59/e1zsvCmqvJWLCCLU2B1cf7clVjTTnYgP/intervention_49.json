I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a long-time friend who's now working for the author's family business. The friend has financial struggles, and the author comes from a wealthier background. The friend started working in the warehouse and their friendship deteriorated. The friend is now being resentful, blaming the author for her mistakes, and spreading negative comments. The author is considering cutting ties, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job and support from the author's family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author has a privileged background and has supported the friend with gifts, vacations, even a car. The friend, on the other hand, has financial difficulties and debt. The author offers her a job in the family business, which pays well, but the friend is underperforming. The author is defending her at work despite her mistakes. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which might have affected their ability to be as supportive as before.\n\nThe friend's behavior is pretty toxic. She's spreading rumors, being nice to the author's face but talking badly behind their back, and even attacking the author's relationship. That's definitely not okay. The author is considering cutting ties, which could have consequences for the friend's job and financial situation. The author is conflicted because they know their parents might stop supporting the friend if they stop being friends.\n\nNow, the key points here are mutual responsibility. The author provided opportunities and support, but the friend's response is hostile and ungrateful. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to distance themselves from someone who is toxic and spreading lies. The friend's actions, especially the personal attacks and betrayal, justify the author ending the friendship. The author also has their own health issues to deal with, which might make maintaining the friendship unsustainable. The author isn't exploiting the friend; they've been supportive. The friend's resentment and unprofessional behavior are her own issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties.\n"
