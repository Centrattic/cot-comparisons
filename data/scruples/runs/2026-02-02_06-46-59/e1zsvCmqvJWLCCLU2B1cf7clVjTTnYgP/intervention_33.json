I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time, and the author comes from a wealthier background. The friend has been included in family vacations and even got a car from the author's parents. The author mentions that they've tried to be supportive, like offering a place for the friend to live, but she declined due to her dog. So the author isn't entirely without support in the relationship.\n\nThen, both work for the family business. The friend took a warehouse job that was offered to her, which pays well, but she's struggling and making mistakes. The author defends her to their parents because they believe her intentions are good. However, the friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, saying the author is holding her back. This seems like a problem.\n\nThe friend has become resentful and is spreading negative things about the author to others, including calling the author a \"spoiled bitch\" and telling the boyfriend to break up. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which might be affecting their work performance, but the friend isn't being supportive. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that their parents will then likely fire the friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author has a history of supporting the friend, but the friend is now being unkind and spreading rumors. The author is justified in wanting to end the friendship because the friend is being toxic and ungrateful. However, the author might feel conflicted because they know that cutting ties could lead to the friend losing her job.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is under stress and has health issues, which might affect their work. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic, and the author is defending her despite her mistakes. But the friend is now turning against the author, which is unfair. The author is in a tough spot, but the friend's actions seem to be the main issue here. The author isn't the one being mean or spreading rumors; it's the friend. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship. They've been supportive when they can, but the friend's actions have crossed a line. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
