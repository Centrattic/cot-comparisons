I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their friend. The author and the friend have been close for a long time, but their relationship is deteriorating. The friend is jealous, the author is from a wealthier background, and now the friend is working for the author's family business. The friend seems to be acting out, blaming the author for her issues and spreading negative things. The author is considering ending the friendship, knowing it might affect the friend's job if they lose their parents' support.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author has been generous: family vacations, gifts, a car. The friend, however, is struggling financially and emotionally. The author is dealing with medical and mental health issues, which affect their work performance, but the friend blames them for her mistakes. The friend's actions\u2014spreading rumors, being resentful, acting nice to the author's face but being harsh behind their back\u2014are problematic. \n\nThe key points are: the friend's jealousy and resentment leading to toxic behavior, the author's generosity, and the author's own challenges. The author is considering cutting ties, which could lead to the friend losing her job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nThe author isn't directly causing the friend's problems, like the debt or job issues. The friend's actions are her own choices and reactions. The author tried to help (offering a place to live, defending her at work) but the friend rejected help and turned hostile. The author's decision to end the friendship is a response to the friend's toxic behavior. In this case, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end a friendship that's becoming harmful. The friend's actions are the root cause of the conflict.\n"
