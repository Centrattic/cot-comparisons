I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their friend. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, their friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, even a new car. The author has had an easier life: good grades, no debt, moved out at 18. The friend still lives with her parents, has over $50k in debt, can't afford to move out. The author offered her a room, but she declined because of her dog and the author's allergies. \n\nNow the friend works in the author's family business. The author defends her at work despite her mistakes. The friend is upset about her job and has started acting resentful. She accused the author of faking depression, called the author's boyfriend, said bad things about her. The author is done being friends and knows that if they stop, her parents will fire her because she's not doing well. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The friend's actions seem pretty toxic. She's making false accusations, spreading rumors, being nice to the author's face but mean behind their back. That's definitely not okay. The author tried to help by offering a place to stay, but the friend turned it down. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which is tough. They're trying to manage their health while still supporting the friend, but the friend is becoming hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a position of privilege. They might feel that the friend is taking advantage of their good fortune. However, the friend's behavior is crossing lines. The author has every right to set boundaries, especially when the friend is being abusive. The fact that the author is trying to defend the friend at work despite her mistakes shows they're trying to help, but the friend isn't reciprocating respect.\n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as self-preservation. Even if the friend is struggling, the friend's actions are harmful. The author isn't obligated to continue a one-sided relationship where the friend is toxic. The fact that the author's parents might fire her if the friendship ends is a consequence the friend would have to face, but the author isn't responsible for that. They\u2019re protecting themselves from someone who's being hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's behavior is the main issue here. The author has done a lot to support her, but the friend's resentment and actions are unjustified. The author is taking a stand against being treated poorly.\n"
