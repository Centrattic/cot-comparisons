I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between two friends where one is from a wealthier background and the other isn't. The key points are:\n\nFirst, the friend (let's call her Amy for clarity) has been receiving support from the author's family\u2014vacations, gifts, a car. The author comes from a well-off family, graduated debt-free due to a family scholarship, and now works in their family business. Amy, on the other hand, has debt, struggles with jobs, and lives with her parents. The author offered her a job in the warehouse, which Amy took, but now their friendship is breaking down.\n\nThe author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which has made her less active as a friend. At work, Amy is making mistakes and blaming the author for delays, even though the author's delays are minimal. Amy has become resentful, making negative comments about the author to others, calling her a leech and a spoiled brat. The author wants to cut ties, knowing that doing so might lead to her parents firing Amy, but she's done with the friendship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA). Let's break it down.\n\nFrom the author's side, she's been supportive, offered a job, tried to defend Amy at work despite the mistakes. She's also dealing with her own issues. Amy, however, is acting out\u2014blaming the author, spreading negativity, and being two-faced. The author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as self-preservation, given Amy's behavior. However, there's a potential consequence: if the author ends the friendship, her parents might stop supporting Amy, leading to her losing the job and possibly the financial support. But Amy's actions (like the negative comments and blaming others) might make the author feel justified in cutting ties.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong: Did she do something to deserve Amy's resentment? She offered a job, tried to help, and defended her. The medical issues are personal and shouldn't be a point of blame. Amy's actions seem to stem from her own frustrations and jealousy. The author isn't the one spreading lies or being two-faced; that's Amy. So, the author's decision to end the friendship because Amy is toxic and ungrateful seems reasonable. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
