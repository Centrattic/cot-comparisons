I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is between two friends, one from a wealthy background and the other not. The key points here are the dynamics of their friendship, the job situation, and the recent fallout.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off family and has had a lot of advantages: family vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend is struggling financially, in debt, and couldn't afford to move out. The author offered to let her live there, but she declined because of her dog. The author's family gave her a job in their warehouse, which pays well. However, the friend is making mistakes at work and blaming the author for not getting orders quick enough. The author has a medical issue causing them to slow down a bit, but it's only 30 minutes. The friend is spreading negative things about the author, calling them names, and pretending to be nice to their face. Now the author wants to end the friendship but is worried that doing so might lead to her being fired, as the family supports her job.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author has supported the friend financially and through opportunities. They tried to help by offering a place to stay, which the friend refused. The job was offered at a higher pay rate than expected. The author is defending the friend at work despite her mistakes. However, the friend is being resentful, spreading harmful rumors, and attacking the author's credibility. The author is now considering cutting ties to protect their own mental health and because the friend's behavior is toxic. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've done a lot to support the friend, but the friend is ungrateful and hostile. The friend's actions are damaging the author's reputation and relationships. The author is also dealing with their own health issues, adding stress to their situation. The friend's resentment seems to stem from jealousy and a lack of appreciation for the support provided.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the author hasn't been there emotionally, especially with the author's reduced social interaction due to depression. The friend's mistakes at work could be causing problems for the family business, and her blaming the author might be a way to deflect responsibility. However, her actions of spreading rumors and attacking the author's character are clearly toxic and unkind.\n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as a necessary step to protect themselves from further harm. The friend's behavior is inappropriate and harmful. While the author is in a privileged position, that doesn't mean they're in the wrong for ending a friendship where the other person is being abusive. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially when the friend is not only ungrateful but actively damaging their life.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have every right to end a toxic friendship, especially after the friend's harmful actions.\n"
