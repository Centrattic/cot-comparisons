I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between two friends where one (the author) is more financially stable and the other (the friend) is struggling. They've been friends a long time, and the friend is now working at the family business with the author.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend is jealous because the author's life has been easier, and the friend is dealing with debt and job issues. The friend has started acting out, blaming the author for her mistakes, spreading negative things to others, and even being mean to the author's boyfriend. The author is tired of it and wants to cut off the friendship, but is worried because her parents might fire the friend if she does.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend is acting out due to resentment, she's being dishonest and spreading rumors, and she's not taking responsibility for her mistakes. The author is trying to defend her at work (because the friend's intentions are good) but is being treated badly. The author is also dealing with health issues, which might affect her work performance a bit, but not enough to impact the friend's tasks.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend but is conflicted because of the friend's job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. \n\nThe author has done a lot to support the friend: offering a job, family vacations, gifts, a car. The friend, however, is toxic now, spreading lies, and not taking responsibility. The author is within her rights to protect herself from a toxic relationship. While the friend's actions are problematic, the author isn't the one who started the conflict. The author is trying to defend the friend's intentions but can't tolerate the friend's negativity. \n\nThe friend's actions, including blaming the author, spreading rumors, and pretending to be nice, clearly show she's the one with the problem here. The author is not at fault for ending a friendship where the other person is being hostile and harmful. Also, the author is in a vulnerable position with her health issues, so cutting off a toxic friend is a reasonable decision.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
