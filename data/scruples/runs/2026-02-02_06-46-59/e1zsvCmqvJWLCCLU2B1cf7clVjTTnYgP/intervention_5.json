I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend who's been acting resentful and now the author wants to end the friendship. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author comes from a wealthy background, their friend does not. The friend has been given opportunities like family vacations, gifts, a car, and a job. The friend is struggling with debt and hasn't been able to find a good job. The author has health issues and depression, which affected their social interactions. The friend is now making mistakes at work, blaming the author, and spreading negative things behind their back.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing that their parents might then fire her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's decision to end the friendship is justified. Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: The friend has become resentful, is spreading lies, and is acting poorly. The author has been trying to defend her at work despite her mistakes. The friend is taking advantage of the author's family's generosity and is now being toxic. The author's health is affected, and they can't be the friend they want to be. Ending the friendship is a self-preservation move.\n\nOn the other side: The author is in a position of privilege and might be using that to control the outcome. The friend's resentment could be valid if the author is indeed being dismissive of her struggles. However, the friend's actions (backstabbing, lying, spreading rumors) are serious. The author is trying to help (offering a job, defending her), but the friend's response is hostile.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions led to the friend's resentment. The author mentions that their medical condition slowed down work processes, but only by 30 minutes. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, which might not be fair. The author is also not neglecting the friend entirely; they're defending her at work. However, the friend's behavior is clearly toxic and malicious.\n\nThe author is considering cutting the friend off, knowing it will lead to her losing the job. Is that fair? Well, the author isn't directly firing her; that's the parents' decision. The author is removing their personal support, which is their right. If the friend's job is on the line because of her own performance and actions, then the author isn't the one responsible for her job loss. The author's main issue is the toxic behavior of the friend.\n\nIn terms of the friendship, the friend has turned into someone who is spreading lies and being rude. The author is justified in ending a friendship that's causing them emotional distress. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own well-being. The friend's actions are the root cause of the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
