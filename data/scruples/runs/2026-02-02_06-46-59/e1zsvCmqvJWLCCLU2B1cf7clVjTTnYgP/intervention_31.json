I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author is friends with someone from childhood. Their family is well-off, and the friend is not. The friend has been part of the author's family life, getting vacations and gifts, even a car. The author acknowledges their privileged position but also mentions personal struggles like medical issues and depression. The friend, on the other hand, is in a tough spot financially, in debt, and still living with her parents. The author offered her a place to live but was rejected due to the dog. \n\nThe friend is now working at the author's family business, which the author manages. The friend is making mistakes, and the author defends her, even though she's underperforming. The friend is getting resentful, blaming the author for her work issues and spreading negative things about her. The author is considering cutting ties, knowing that without their support, the friend might lose her job, which would affect her financially. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author has been fair in supporting the friend in the past\u2014family vacations, gifts, the car, offering a job. The friend's current resentment seems to be more about her own circumstances rather than the author's actions. However, the author is in a position where ending the friendship could lead to the friend losing her job. But does that make the author responsible for the friend's actions or the consequences of her own behavior?\n\nThe friend is actively spreading lies and being toxic, which is a significant red flag. The author has a right to distance themselves from someone who is being harmful. The author mentions that their parents might not support the friend if the friendship ends, but the author's parents are the ones who gave the friend the job. It's their business, so if the friend is underperforming, they could fire her regardless of the friendship. The author isn't forcing the parents to keep her employed; they're just aware that if they stop defending her, the parents might let her go. \n\nThe author is also dealing with personal health issues and depression. They're not being negligent by not being as active as before. The friend's resentment is misplaced, especially since the author is advocating for her at work despite her mistakes. The friend's actions, like spreading rumors and attacking the author's boyfriend, are clearly toxic. The author is justified in ending the friendship to protect their own well-being.\n\nBut maybe there's a point where the author could have handled it differently. Perhaps offering more support or communication, but given the friend's behavior, continuing the friendship might not be healthy. The author isn't causing the friend's problems; the friend is creating issues by blaming the author. So, the author is not in the wrong for cutting ties.\n"
