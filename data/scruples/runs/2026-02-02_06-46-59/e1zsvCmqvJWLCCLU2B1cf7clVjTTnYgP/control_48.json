I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The main points are that the author is friends with someone who's been through a lot of struggles, both financially and academically. The author's family has supported this friend a lot, even giving her a car and job opportunities. However, the friend is now being very resentful, blaming the author for her work mistakes and spreading negative things about her. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that this might lead to the friend losing her job if the author's parents stop supporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The author has offered help in the past, like the room to live and the job. The friend accepted the job but is underperforming and is now being critical. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014spreading rumors, being nice to the author's face but mean behind their back. The author is now at a point where they want to end the friendship, which could impact the friend's job if the parents stop supporting her.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is at fault. The author has done a lot to support the friend, but the friend's actions are hostile. The author is justified in wanting to protect their own mental health and work environment. The friend's resentment and lies are her own issues, and the author isn't responsible for the friend's decisions or the consequences of them cutting off the friendship. The author isn't wrong for ending a friendship that's become toxic, especially when the other person is actively undermining them. The friend's actions are more in the wrong here, so the author isn't at fault.\n"
