I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a friend who comes from a less privileged background, and the author is more well-off. The friend has been given a lot of support, like family vacations, gifts, a car, and a job in the family business. But now there's a falling out.\n\nThe friend is struggling with debt, still lives with her parents, and has a job in the warehouse. She's making mistakes, and the author is defending her at work. The author has personal medical issues and depression, which might be affecting their ability to support the friend as much. The friend is now being resentful and spreading negative things about the author, even calling her a leech and a spoiled bitch. The author wants to cut off the friendship, knowing it might lead to her being fired.\n\nHmm. The author is considering ending the friendship, but also feels justified because the friend is being toxic. The friend's actions are pretty hurtful\u2014publicly accusing her of being fake and spreading negativity. The author has tried to be a good friend, even offering support like a place to live, but the friend rejected that offer because of the dog. The author's job is affected by the friend's mistakes, and the friend is blaming her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is in a better position financially and has given a lot of support. But the friend's behavior is clearly toxic. The author is ending the friendship not just because of the friend's issues but also because of the personal attacks. The author is also dealing with her own health problems, which adds stress.\n\nOn one hand, the friend is struggling, and the author's support has been significant. On the other hand, the friend is attacking her and being ungrateful. The author's decision to end the friendship might be seen as cutting off someone in need, but the friend's behavior is abusive and harmful. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially when the friend is spreading lies and being a toxic presence.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's actions are inexcusable, and the author doesn't owe her continued friendship if it's one-sided and harmful. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
