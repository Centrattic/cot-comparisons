I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (AITA) after their friend turned on them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy background and has had many advantages: family vacations, gifts, a car, no debt from school, and a job in the family business. The friend, on the other hand, hasn't had the same opportunities. She's in debt, struggles with school, is still with her parents, and now works in the warehouse for the author's family business.\n\nThe author has supported the friend by offering her a job, even paying her more than the minimum. They also tried to help her move in but she declined due to her dog. The author has health issues and depression, which made them less available as a friend. The friend started making mistakes at work and became resentful, blaming the author for her shortcomings. She spread negative things about the author, pretending to be nice to their face but trash-talking behind their back. The author is now considering ending the friendship, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job and support from the author's parents.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for ending the friendship under these circumstances?\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They have given the friend opportunities (job, car, etc.) without being forced. The friend accepted the job, which was offered at a higher pay. The author is defending her at work despite her mistakes, which shows support. The author's health issues are a valid reason for reduced social interaction. The friend's behavior, however, is toxic\u2014spreading lies, blaming the author, and acting two-faced.\n\nThe friend's actions are clearly problematic. She's not only making mistakes at work but also spreading negativity and resentment. The author has the right to end a friendship that's becoming toxic and harmful. The potential consequence of losing her job if the author cuts ties might be a factor, but the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's detrimental to their well-being. The friend's behavior is the root cause here, not the author's decision to end the relationship.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author should have handled the friend's issues with more patience or tried to help further. However, the author has already provided significant support. The friend's response is hostile and ungrateful, which justifies the author distancing themselves. The author is within their rights to prioritize their mental health and well-being.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
