I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author and their friend have been friends a long time, but now there's some tension. The friend is resented because the author comes from a wealthier background and has had an easier life. The author mentions that their parents have given the friend gifts, even a car, and offered her a job. The friend's struggles with school, debt, and job performance are contrasted with the author's own success.\n\nThe friend is now working in the family business, and there's conflict at work. The author is defending the friend despite her mistakes, but the friend is blaming the author for her issues and spreading negative comments. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that would lead to the friend losing her job and support from the author's parents.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let's break it down. The key points are the friend's resentment and the author's response. The author is in a position of privilege and has supported the friend, but the friend is now acting out. The author is ending the friendship partly because of the friend's behavior and partly because they know the consequences will be severe for the friend.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author's support might have created unrealistic expectations. However, the friend's response\u2014publicly insulting the author, blaming them, and pretending to be nice\u2014is toxic. The author is ending the friendship to protect themselves from the friend's negativity, which is a valid reason. The author isn't forcing the friend out of the job; it's the friend's own performance issues. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's become toxic. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
