I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user provided a detailed situation where the author is questioning whether they're at fault for wanting to end a friendship with someone who's now being resentful and spreading negative things about them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthier background, has had more opportunities, and has supported her friend in various ways\u2014like family vacations, gifts, buying her a car. The friend is in a tougher spot financially, has debt, struggles with school and work, and is still living with her parents. The author offered her a job at the family business, which the friend accepted. But now, the friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, spreading rumors about her, and being toxic.\n\nThe author is dealing with her own medical and personal issues, which might be affecting her ability to be as active a friend as before. The friend is acting resentful, even going as far as telling the author's boyfriend to break up with her and calling her a leech. The author wants to cut ties, knowing that her parents might then let the friend go from her job, which could hurt the friend financially.\n\nThe user, who is asking if the author is in the wrong, initially thinks the author is at fault but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes, at fault) or B (no). \n\nNow, considering the situation: The author has provided support and opportunities to her friend. The friend, in return, is being ungrateful, spreading lies, and acting out of jealousy. The author is ending the friendship not just because of differences in status but because of the friend's toxic behavior. The author's decision is also influenced by her own struggles and the friend's unkind actions.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't doing anything wrong by ending a friendship. People have the right to distance themselves from toxic relationships, even if the other person is in a worse situation. The friend's actions are the root of the problem here\u2014being ungrateful, spreading lies, and acting resentful. The author's response is a reaction to being mistreated, not her being in the wrong. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
