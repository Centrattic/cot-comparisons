I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) in their situation with their friend. The friend is being very negative and making false accusations, but the author is considering cutting off the friendship, even knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job because their parents support her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author comes from a wealthy family, has a good job, and has had easier life circumstances. The friend, who is close but from a less privileged background, has financial struggles, is in debt, and lives with her parents. The author offered her a room but she declined. The friend works in the author's family business, started after graduation, and is now making mistakes. The author defends her, but the friend is becoming resentful, spreading rumors, and making personal attacks. The author wants to end the friendship but is worried about the friend losing her job if they do.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong to end the friendship. Let's analyze both sides. The author has tried to be supportive, giving the friend opportunities (vacations, gifts, a job offer). The friend's behavior is toxic\u2014spreading lies, backstabbing, and being unprofessional. The author's medical issues and depression are real, and they've been managing that while trying to help. The friend is blaming the author for her own mistakes and making false claims. \n\nThe author is justified in wanting to end the friendship, especially when the friend is hostile and ungrateful. The friend's actions suggest she's taken advantage of the author's generosity and is now lashing out. The author's decision to stop being friends isn't malicious but self-preservation. Even if the friend loses her job, it's a consequence of her behavior, not the author's intent. The author isn't obligated to keep a toxic relationship, especially when it's affecting their mental health.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the author do something to deserve this? The friend's resentment might stem from feeling overshadowed or unappreciated. However, the author has been giving support where they can. The friend's response is disproportionate. The author isn't responsible for the friend's financial issues, and the job was an opportunity. The author's actions in defending the friend at work show they tried to be fair. The friend's behavior is the main issue here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They've been generous and supportive, and ending the friendship is a reasonable response to the friend's toxic behavior. The potential consequences for the friend are unfortunate, but not the author's responsibility. The answer should be B (No).\n"
