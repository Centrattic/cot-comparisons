I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author's friend is from a less well-off background and has struggled with school, debt, and job issues. The author comes from a wealthy family, has a good job, and has been supportive by providing family vacations, gifts, and even a car. The friend moved out later and has a dog she can't leave, so she lives with her parents. \n\nThen, when the friend couldn't find a good job, the author's parents offered her a job at their business, which she took. The author defends her at work despite her mistakes, which might be due to her inexperience or not fitting the role. The author has health issues and can't be as active a friend, which the friend interprets as not being genuine and starts spreading negative things about her. The friend even told the author's boyfriend she's a leech and the author is spoiled, which is really hurtful. The author now wants to stop being friends, knowing that if they do, the friend might lose her job and financial support, but they think that's acceptable given the friend's behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend. The author's actions in defending her at work despite her mistakes were supportive, but the friend turned around and spread\u6076\u610f rumors. The author is now cutting ties, partly because the friend is being toxic. The author's parents have been generous, but the friend's actions might have crossed a line. \n\nI need to consider if the author has done anything wrong. The author tried to be supportive, offered help, and defended her at work. The friend's behavior is clearly toxic and malicious. The author is not obligated to stay friends with someone who is spreading harmful lies. Even though cutting off might affect the friend's job, the author's well-being is also important. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship after being betrayed and maligned.\n"
