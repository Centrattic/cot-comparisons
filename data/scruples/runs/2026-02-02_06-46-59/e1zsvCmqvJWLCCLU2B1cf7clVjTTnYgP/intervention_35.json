I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and a friend have been close for a long time. The author is from a wealthy family, which has given the friend gifts, family vacations, even a car. The friend comes from a less fortunate background, has student debt, hasn't moved out yet, and took a job at the author's family business. \n\nThe friend is now working in the warehouse, making mistakes. The author defends her, but the friend is blaming the author for her issues. The author is dealing with medical and mental health problems, which might be affecting her work pace. The friend starts spreading rumors and being resentful, even calling the author names behind her back. The author wants to end the friendship, knowing that her parents might then fire the friend. The question is if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nThe author's side: They feel their friend is ungrateful, taking advantage of their generosity, and now being hostile. The author is under stress with their own health issues and is trying to help the friend by defending her at work. The friend is causing problems by blaming the author and spreading negativity. The author is done with the toxic friendship.\n\nThe friend's side: She's struggling financially, took the job out of necessity, and is frustrated by her mistakes and the work environment. She might feel the author is being dismissive of her struggles, leading to resentment. Her actions (spreading rumors) are definitely wrong, but maybe she's reacting to feeling overwhelmed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is ending the friendship because of the friend's behavior, not for the friend's struggles. The author isn't cutting her off just because of her economic situation but because the friend is now hostile and uncooperative. The author is also dealing with their own health issues, which complicates things. The friend's actions (slandering the author, being dishonest at work) are unkind and unprofessional. The author's decision to stop the friendship is a response to these actions, not the friend's financial issues. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting themselves from a toxic relationship. The friend's behavior is inappropriate, and the author has the right to distance themselves. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The author could have tried to mediate or support the friend more, but the friend's actions are so negative that it's reasonable to walk away. The author isn't being mean for being in a better position; they're reacting to the friend's actions. The friend's jealousy and blame are the root issues here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're justified in ending a friendship where the other person is spreading harmful rumors and being unkind, regardless of their own advantages.\n"
