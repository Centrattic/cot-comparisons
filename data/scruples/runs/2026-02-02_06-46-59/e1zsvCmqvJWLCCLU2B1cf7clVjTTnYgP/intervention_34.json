I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend is in a less fortunate position. The friend has been included in family vacations and even received a car from the author's parents. The author managed to graduate without debt thanks to family money, while the friend has significant debt and struggles with her career. The friend works in the author's family's warehouse, which was a job offer from the author's parents. There's tension because the friend is making mistakes at work and has become resentful towards the author, blaming them and spreading negative comments. The author is dealing with health issues and depression, which might have affected their ability to support the friend as much as before.\n\nNow, the author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that their parents might let the friend go if she's not a friend anymore. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a different perspective.\n\nHmm. Let me think about possible angles. The friend's resentment might stem from feeling jealous or unappreciated. The author's family has supported the friend financially, but that doesn't mean the friend is in the right. The author is trying to defend the friend at work despite her mistakes, which is commendable. However, the friend's behavior is clearly toxic\u2014making false accusations and spreading negativity. The author's decision to end the friendship is understandable given the friend's actions. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Maybe not. They're not responsible for the friend's resentment. They've offered support (like the room) when possible, even though the friend declined. The author's health issues are valid and might have contributed to the friend's frustration, but that's not the author's fault. The friend's actions seem to be her own choice, and the author is justified in wanting to distance themselves from someone who is spreading malicious rumors and being unkind. Additionally, the author is aware of the potential consequences (the friend losing the job) but still feels it's necessary for their own well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried to reconcile or address the issues more directly before cutting off. But given the friend's toxic behavior, ending the friendship might be the healthiest option. The key points are the friend's actions versus the author's. The author did what they could to support the friend, and the friend's response is inexcusable. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
