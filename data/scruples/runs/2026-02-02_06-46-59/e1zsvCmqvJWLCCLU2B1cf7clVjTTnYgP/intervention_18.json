I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The story is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has a friend who's been close for a long time. The friend comes from a less well-off background, and the author's family has supported her with things like vacations, gifts, a car. The author is from a wealthy family, had an easy path through school, and now works in a family business. The friend, on the other hand, has struggled with debt, couldn't find a good job, and is now working in the warehouse for the same business.\n\nThe friend's resentment seems to be growing. She's making mistakes at work, which the author's parents are frustrated with. The author defends her, maybe because they have a history. But the friend starts blaming the author for her mistakes, even accusing her of being spoiled and attention-seeking. She also talks negatively about the author behind her back, even to the boyfriend.\n\nThe author is now considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that without their support, the friend might lose her job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. On one hand, the friend has been unkind and resentful. On the other, the author might feel guilty about cutting off someone they've helped, especially if the friend's job depends on the author's parents. But the author's well-being is also a factor here. They have their own medical issues and depression, which might make maintaining the friendship stressful.\n\nThe friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014backstabbing, spreading rumors, pretending to be nice. The author isn't doing anything wrong by defending her, but the friend's actions are toxic. The author is considering ending the friendship, which is their right. They don't owe the friend their friendship, especially if it's causing them harm. Also, the author's parents are the ones who hired the friend, so the author's decision to stop being friends might not directly affect the job if the parents are still okay with her working there. But the author is worried that without their support, the friend will be fired. However, the author isn't the one making the job decisions\u2014her parents are.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. They've tried to be a good friend, but the friend's actions are toxic. The author has the right to protect their own mental health and set boundaries. The fact that the friend is blaming the author for issues beyond her control (like the author's medical condition) is another red flag. The author isn't responsible for the friend's mistakes or her inability to manage her own life. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
