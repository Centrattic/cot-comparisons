I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthier background, and their family has supported the friend, like buying her a car and including her in vacations. The friend, on the other hand, has a harder life financially, is in debt, and lives with her parents. The friend even turned down the author's offer to move in with her, which the author mentions is because of the dog allergy.\n\nThen, the author works in the family business and has been managing the front office. The friend got a job in the warehouse, which was offered at a higher wage than usual. However, the friend's work performance has been poor, leading to frustration from the author's parents. The author defends her, but the friend starts making excuses, blaming the author's medical condition for her mistakes. The friend also accuses the author of being attention-seeking and trash-talking to others, even pretending to be nice to their face.\n\nThe author now wants to end the friendship, knowing that doing so might lead to the friend losing her job and financial support from the author's family. They're asking if they're at fault for cutting ties.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author provided support to the friend, but the friend turned hostile. The author is considering ending the friendship, which would impact the friend's employment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've been supportive and tried to help, but the friend's behavior has become toxic. The author is also dealing with personal issues and depression. The friend is blaming the author for her problems, which is unfair. The author's parents are frustrated with the friend's work performance, so if the author stops defending her, the friend could lose her job. But the author is choosing to end the friendship anyway.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's actions seem more problematic. She's making false accusations, spreading rumors, and causing issues at work. The author has a right to distance themselves from a toxic relationship, especially if it's affecting their mental health. However, the author might feel conflicted because they know ending the friendship could hurt the friend financially. But the author isn't the one responsible for her job; that's the parents' decision based on her performance. The author's role is as a friend, so cutting ties due to the friend's behavior is understandable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I think the friend's actions justify the author ending the friendship. The author isn't obligated to maintain a toxic relationship. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
