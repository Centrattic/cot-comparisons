I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their lifelong friend. The author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend doesn't. The friend has been part of family vacations, received gifts, even a new car. The author had an easy life, graduated debt-free because of a great-grandpa's support, moved out at 18. The friend struggled with school, has $50k in debt, still lives with parents at 26, and the author offered her a place to stay but she declined because of the dog and allergies.\n\nNow, the friend is working in the family business's warehouse, which the author's parents offered her a job at a higher wage. Since then, their friendship has deteriorated. The author has been dealing with personal and medical issues, depression, so they haven't been active as a friend. The friend is making a lot of mistakes at work, and the author is defending her. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, even though the author's delays are minor. The friend calls the author a spoiled attention-seeker, says bad things to the boyfriend and others. The author is considering ending the friendship, knowing that the parents will then see her as just an employee and might fire her if she keeps messing up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they stop being friends.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They've been generous with their friend, providing opportunities and support. They're trying to defend the friend at work despite her mistakes, which shows loyalty. The author is struggling with health issues, so they can't be as active. The friend is now lashing out, which is causing the author to reconsider the friendship. The author feels the friend is being resentful and unfair, especially since the author has been in a tough spot themselves.\n\nFrom the friend's side: She might feel jealous or envious of the author's privilege. She's in a difficult financial situation, has debt, can't move out. The author's job offer in the warehouse was a chance, but maybe she felt it was inadequate or that the author had the power to get her more opportunities. Her resentment could stem from feeling that the author has an easy life and doesn't understand her struggles. Blaming the author's delays for her mistakes is a problem, but it's possible she's feeling the pressure and taking it out on others.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend because of this conflict. The parents might stop supporting her if the author does that. The key points here are the friend's behavior (backstabbing, making accusations, pretending to be nice), the author's efforts to defend her despite the friend's issues, and the author's own challenges. \n\nThe author isn't the one causing the friend's problems; the friend is making her own choices and reacting negatively. The author is in a position where they can't be friends anymore because of the friend's toxic behavior. The parents' support is likely because of the friendship, so ending it might lead to consequences, but the author isn't responsible for the friend's career anymore. The friend's jealousy and inability to handle her situation might be the root cause, not the author's actions. \n\nSo, the author is justified in ending the friendship. They've done their part by defending the friend and offering support. The friend's actions are unkind and unfounded. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
