I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time, but there's a class difference. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations and even got a car from the author's parents. The author has an easier life, graduated debt-free, and works in the family business. The friend struggled in school, has significant debt, and still lives with her parents. The author offered her a place to stay, but the friend turned it down because of her dog allergy issue. Now, the friend works in the warehouse of the family business, but their relationship has deteriorated. The friend is criticizing the author's depression, spreading rumors, and acting nicely to her face but not behind. The author wants to end the friendship, but they're worried about the friend losing her job if they do.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's analyze both sides.\n\nThe author's side: They've supported the friend in many ways\u2014gifts, vacations, a car, housing offer, job opportunity. They've defended the friend at work despite her mistakes. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which might affect their ability to be as active a friend. The friend, on the other hand, is being resentful, spreading negative things about the author, and not being honest. The author wants to end the friendship because the friend is toxic and has betrayed their trust.\n\nThe friend's side: She's in a worse financial situation, has a hard time finding a good job, and is dealing with her own issues. She might feel envious of the author's privileges and support. Her resentment could stem from feeling that the author doesn't understand her struggles. However, her actions (spreading rumors, blaming the author for her mistakes) cross a line. The author offered significant help, and the friend's response is ungrateful and hostile.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they did their part by offering help. The friend's behavior is problematic. The author is within their right to end a friendship that's becoming toxic, especially when the friend is undermining them. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship if the other person is being harmful. The potential consequence of the friend losing her job is a separate issue. While the author might feel a sense of guilt, the friend's actions likely justify ending the relationship. The author isn't responsible for the friend's poor choices or her inability to handle her own struggles. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
