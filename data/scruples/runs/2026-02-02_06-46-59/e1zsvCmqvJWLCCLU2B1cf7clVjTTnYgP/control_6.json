I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a friend who's been close for a long time but now there's a lot of tension. The author comes from a wealthy family and has been generous with their friend, giving her gifts and even a car. The friend, on the other hand, has struggled financially and academically, and now she's an employee in the author's family business.\n\nThe main points are that the friend is acting resentful, making false accusations, and spreading negative things about the author. The author is dealing with health issues and has been trying to support the friend despite her mistakes. The friend, however, is blaming the author for her problems and even turning their mutual acquaintances against her.\n\nThe author now wants to cut ties, but they\u2019re worried that doing so might lead their parents to let the friend go because she's underperforming. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship, considering the friend's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has done anything to deserve this treatment. The author has been generous, offered support, and defended the friend at work. Their health issues seem genuine, and the friend's claims about the author being a \"spoiled brat\" don't hold up, especially since the author has been trying to help.\n\nThe friend's actions\u2014spreading rumors, blaming the author, and treating them poorly\u2014seem to be her own issues. The author isn't obligated to continue a friendship where the other person is toxic and unappreciative. Even though the author's family supports her financially, the friend's behavior justifies ending the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the author's fear that their parents might fire the friend if they stop being friends is a bit of a red herring. The friend's job performance is her responsibility. The author isn't required to maintain the friendship to prevent her from losing her job, especially since the friend's behavior is negatively impacting the workplace.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They've done their part, and the friend's actions make the friendship unsustainable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
