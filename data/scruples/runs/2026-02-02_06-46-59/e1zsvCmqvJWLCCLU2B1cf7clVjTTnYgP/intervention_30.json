I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their friend. Let me start by breaking down the details provided.\n\nThe author comes from a wealthy family, which has provided a lot of support to their friend. The friend, on the other hand, has a tougher background\u2014financial struggles, debt, and hasn't moved out of her parents' house yet. The author offered her a job in their family business, which paid well above the market rate. However, the friend started making mistakes at work, blaming the author for delays, and became resentful. She spread negative comments about the author to others, including calling her a leech and telling the boyfriend to break up. The author is now considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that their parents might fire her if they stop supporting her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They provided significant support to their friend, including family vacations, gifts, a car, and a well-paying job. The author has health issues and depression, which are affecting their work performance slightly. They defend the friend at work despite her mistakes because they believe her intentions are good. The author is now cutting off the friend due to her negative behavior and the friend's betrayal, which is hurtful and undermining.\n\nFrom the friend's side, she's struggling with debt, couldn't find a job, and her parents want her to move out. She was given a job opportunity that's better than market rate but performed poorly. She took the job, which might have led to expectations of competence. Her resentment and blame towards the author seem to stem from her frustrations, but her actions (spreading negativity, undermining) are harmful.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions versus the author's support. The author provided a job that's a step up for the friend, but she didn't meet the required performance. The author has health issues that slightly affect their work, which the friend is blaming inaccurately. The friend's response\u2014spreading lies and being resentful\u2014seems to be the main issue. The author is now cutting ties, possibly out of self-respect after betrayal, but the friend might lose her job if the author stops advocating for her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for cutting off the friend? The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's toxic and one-sided, especially when the friend is spreading lies. The author's support was given in good faith, but the friend's response was harmful. The author's decision to end the friendship isn't just about convenience but about protecting their well-being. However, the author might need to consider the consequences for the friend, as she relies on the author's family for support. But the friend's actions in work and personal life could justify the author's decision.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided support, but the friend's behavior crossed into betrayal and malice. The author has the right to end the friendship, even if it means the friend might lose her job. The friend's actions are the root of the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
