I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend doesn't. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, even a car. The author has had an easier life, no debt, moved out at 18. The friend is still with her parents at 26, has over $50k in debt, and can't move out because of her dog and allergies. \n\nThe author works in the family business, managing the front office. The friend works in the warehouse, which the author's parents offered her at a higher pay. Their friendship has deteriorated after the friend started working there. The friend is making mistakes at work, and the author defends her. The friend is resentful, accuses the author of being fake and spoiled, says negative things to others. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might affect their work efficiency. The friend blames the author for her mistakes. Now the author wants to end the friendship, but is worried that their parents will fire her if the friendship ends.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did anything wrong. The author offered support by letting the friend stay with them, but the friend refused due to the dog. The author's parents provided a job opportunity, which the friend accepted. The author is trying to defend her despite her mistakes, which shows some loyalty. However, the friend is acting out, spreading rumors, and being toxic. The author's decision to cut ties is influenced by knowing the consequences for the friend. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior versus the author's actions. The author hasn't done anything to deserve the friend's treatment. The friend is in a vulnerable position, but her actions are hostile. The author is not wrong for wanting to end a toxic friendship. The friend's resentment and betrayal are her own issues. The author's concern about the friend's job if the friendship ends is a consequence, but not the author's fault. The author is not responsible for the friend's decisions or her negative behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
