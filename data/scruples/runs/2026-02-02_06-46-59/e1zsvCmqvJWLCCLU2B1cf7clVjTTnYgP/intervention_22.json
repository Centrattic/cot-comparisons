I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to cut off their friend after a bunch of issues. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time, but there's a big difference in their financial situations. The author comes from a wealthy family, has a good job, and their family has been supportive, even giving the friend gifts and a car. The friend, on the other hand, is in debt, struggles with school, and is still living with her parents. The author offered her a place to stay, but she turned it down because of her dog and the author's allergies.\n\nNow, the friend works in the family business the author runs. The author has health issues and depression, which might be affecting their ability to manage the office efficiently. The friend is making mistakes at work and blaming the author for delays. She's also been spreading negative things about the author to their mutual friends and the author's boyfriend. The author wants to end the friendship but is worried that their parents will stop supporting her, which could lead to her losing the job.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's accurate. Let me consider both sides. The author has tried to support the friend financially and emotionally, even offering a job. However, the friend's resentment is leading to a toxic work environment and personal attacks. The author is dealing with their own medical issues and is doing their best, but the friend is not only underperforming but also spreading lies. The author's decision to end the friendship might be a way to protect their own well-being and work environment, even if it means the friend loses financial support.\n\nBut wait, is the author being unfair by cutting off the friend? The friend's actions are clearly harmful, but the author is in a position of power. Maybe they should have addressed the issues earlier or tried to mediate the work problems. However, the friend's behavior is unprofessional and malicious, which justifies the author distancing themselves. The author isn't firing her as an employee, just ending the personal friendship. Since the friend is an employee now, the author can't control her job status but can choose their social circle.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship. The friend's actions are the main problem here. The author has been supportive, but the friend's resentment and lies are beyond their control. The answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
