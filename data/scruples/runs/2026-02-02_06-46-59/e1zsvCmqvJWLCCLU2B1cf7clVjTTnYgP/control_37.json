I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between two friends where one is from a wealthier background and the other isn't. The author, who comes from a well-off family, has been friends with this person for a long time. They've even included the friend in family vacations and given her gifts, even a car. The friend is struggling financially, has debt, and couldn't find a good job after college. She took a job in the author's family business, which the author's parents offered at twice the market rate. \n\nNow, after starting this job, their relationship has deteriorated. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which caused them to become less active in their friendship. The friend starts making mistakes at work, gets frustrated, and blames the author for not being prompt enough, even though the author's delays are minor. The friend spreads negative things about the author, calls her a leech and a spoiled person, and pretends to be nice to her face. The author wants to end the friendship but is worried that doing so might lead to her parents firing the friend because they'll no longer support her as a friend.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off the friend despite knowing that might lead to her losing her job. \n\nSo, breaking this down: The author has tried to help the friend, offering support like the job, housing (which she refused), and including her in family activities. The friend, on the other hand, is now hostile, spreading rumors, and being resentful. The author's actions in ending the friendship could be seen as self-preservation after repeated negative behavior from the friend. However, there's a potential consequence for the friend if she loses the job. \n\nBut is the author responsible for the friend's job? The friend is an employee of the family business, and the author's parents are the ones who hired her. The author's decision to end the friendship doesn't directly cause her to lose the job unless the author's parents stop supporting her because of the friendship. However, the author is aware of that link. Is the author manipulating the situation? Maybe not directly, but there's a conflict of interest here. \n\nThe key points are the friend's toxic behavior, the author's attempts to support her, and the friend's betrayal by spreading harmful lies. The author's personal issues (depression, medical problems) are real and may affect their ability to be as supportive as before. The friend's resentment seems to stem from jealousy or feeling entitled to more support, but she's turning it into blame towards the author. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for ending a friendship where the friend is being abusive and dishonest. The friend's actions have crossed into harassment and spreading malicious rumors. The author's decision is to protect their mental health and distance from toxicity, which is understandable. The potential consequence for the friend is unfortunate, but the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that is being actively poisoned by the other party. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
