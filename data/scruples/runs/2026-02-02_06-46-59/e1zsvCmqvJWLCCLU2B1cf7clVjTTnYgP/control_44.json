I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, while the friend is not as well-off. The friend has received a lot of support from the author's family, like vacations, gifts, and even a car. The author mentions they have an easier life, no debt, and a job in the family business. The friend has $50k in debt and struggles to find a good job. The author offered her a room to live in, but she declined because of her dog, which the author is allergic to. \n\nThe friend now works in the family business's warehouse, but is making mistakes. The author defends her because they think her intentions are good. The friend is blaming the author for her work issues, saying the author's slower work (due to medical issues and depression) is causing her problems. The author argues that their delays are minor and not impactful. \n\nThe friend has become resentful, called the author a spoiled attention-seeker, lied to the boyfriend, and spread rumors. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that their parents might then fire her, leading to her losing the job and support. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author has been generous, giving the friend opportunities and support. The friend, on the other hand, is now being unkind, spreading negativity, and not taking responsibility for her work issues. The author's medical issues are real, and the friend is not only not supportive but is attacking them. The author is at a crossroads where ending the friendship could lead to the friend losing her job and support, but the friend's behavior is toxic.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's harmful. The friend's actions are inconsiderate and unjust. The author isn't the one being in the wrong here; they've been supportive and are now facing betrayal. Even though cutting the friend off might have consequences, the friend's actions have already caused harm. The author is justified in prioritizing their well-being and ending the toxic relationship.\n"
