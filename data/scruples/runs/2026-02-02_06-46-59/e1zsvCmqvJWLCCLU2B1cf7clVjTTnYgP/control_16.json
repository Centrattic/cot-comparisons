I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) given the circumstances. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and her friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, and her friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, even a car. The author has had an easier life academically and financially, graduating debt-free. The friend has significant student debt and struggles to live independently. The author offered to let her live with her to help, but the friend declined due to a dog allergy.\n\nNow, the friend works in the author's family business, which the author manages. The friend is making a lot of mistakes, and the author defends her. The author is dealing with her own medical and depression issues, which might affect her work performance. The friend resents this and starts spreading negative things about the author, even to her boyfriend. The author feels the friend is jealous and that she's been unfairly labeled as spoiled. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job if she does.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: She's in a tough spot with her health and is trying to support her friend as much as possible. She's defending the friend despite her mistakes. The friend, on the other hand, is acting out, making false accusations, and undermining the author. The author's decision to end the friendship is a personal choice, especially given the friend's toxic behavior. However, the author is also aware that cutting ties might affect the friend's job security. But the friend's actions (spreading rumors, being unkind) might justify the author's stance.\n\nThe friend's actions seem more problematic. She's not holding up her end at work, and instead of addressing her issues or seeking help, she's blaming the author and spreading negativity. The author has already extended support (the job offer, defending her) despite the challenges. The friend's response is ungrateful and hostile.\n\nThe author's decision to stop being friends is a reaction to the friend's behavior, not just the friend's struggles. It's reasonable for someone to end a friendship when it becomes toxic and one-sided, especially when the other person is unappreciative and hostile. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and cutting off someone who is spreading negativity and causing harm.\n"
