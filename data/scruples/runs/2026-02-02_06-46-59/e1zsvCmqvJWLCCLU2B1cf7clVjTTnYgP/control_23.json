I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) in their situation. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend is upset because the author is from a wealthy family and has had an easier life. The author's family has given the friend gifts, even a car. The friend has struggled financially, has debt, couldn't find a good job, and took a warehouse job with the author's parents. The author defends her at work despite her mistakes. The friend, however, is now resentful, spreading negative things about the author, pretending to be nice to her face, and making excuses for her actions. The author is now considering cutting off the friend, knowing that might lead to losing her job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author feels the friend is being unkind and spreading lies. The friend, on the other hand, is likely feeling jealous and resentful due to the author's better circumstances. The author has tried to help (offered a place to stay, defended her at work), but the friend turned down help and then blames the author for work issues. The author is ending the friendship because of the friend's toxic behavior, not because of their financial situations. The author is also dealing with personal medical issues, which might affect their ability to work efficiently, but the friend is blaming her.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The author isn't at fault for the friend's resentment or jealousy. The friend's actions (spreading rumors, pretending to be nice) are malicious. The author defending her at work despite mistakes shows she's trying to be supportive. The friend is crossing boundaries by involving personal relationships (talking to the boyfriend) and spreading lies. The author's decision to end the friendship is a response to the friend's harmful behavior, not just because of their different life situations. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
