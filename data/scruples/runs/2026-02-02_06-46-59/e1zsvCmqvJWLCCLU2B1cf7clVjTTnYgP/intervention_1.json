I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The friend is part of the author's family vacations, gets gifts, and even a new car from the author's parents. The author comes from a well-off family, while the friend isn't as fortunate. The author mentions that they graduated without debt because their great-grandpa paid for school, while the friend is over $50k in debt. The author moved out at 18; the friend is 26 and still with her parents.\n\nThe author offered to help the friend by giving her a room to live in, but she refused because of her dog. Now, the friend works in the author's family business in the warehouse, which was offered to her at a higher pay. However, the friend is making a lot of mistakes, and the author's parents are frustrated. The author defends her, but the friend is blaming the author's slowed work (due to medical issues) for her own mistakes. The friend has become resentful, spreading negative things about the author, calling her a spoiled attention-seeker and a leech. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that their parents might then fire the friend if she's not a friend anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author has a valid point that the friend is acting resentful without cause. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which the friend ignores and instead blames the author for her own shortcomings. The friend is spreading false rumors, which is definitely inconsiderate and harmful. The author's offer to help with housing was rejected, so there's no obligation to keep helping. The friend's behavior is toxic, especially when she's pretending to be nice to the author's face but trash-talking behind her back. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a position of privilege and might have been insensitive to the friend's struggles. The friend's financial issues and job performance could be a source of stress, but attacking the author for her success and medical condition is not acceptable. The author defending the friend despite her poor work performance might have been unfair to their parents, but it's also possible the author was trying to be supportive.\n\nThe key here is that the friend's actions are malicious and unfounded. The author is not at fault for ending a toxic friendship where the friend is spreading lies and being unappreciative. The author's decision to stop being friends is a response to the friend's behavior, not just the friend's circumstances. The author isn't responsible for the friend's actions, so cutting off the friendship isn't wrong. The friend's resentment is misplaced, and the author is prioritizing her own well-being. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
