I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been friends for a long time. The friend is from a less well-off background, and the author's family has been generous: she goes on their vacations, gets gifts, even a new car. The author comes from a privileged background, graduated debt-free, moved out at 18. The friend is still living with her parents at 26, has $50k in debt, and can't move out. The author offered her a place to live but she declined because of her dog and allergies. \n\nNow, the friend works in the family business the author is part of. The author defends her at work despite her making mistakes. The friend starts blaming the author for her errors, and even goes as far as saying the author is faking depression to get attention. She also talks badly about the author to others. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that if they do, their parents might fire her because she's not an employee anymore, leading to her job loss and possible financial trouble. The author is conflicted about whether they're in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let me break this down. First, the author has been supportive, offering a job and a place to live. Despite the friend's mistakes, they defend her. The friend, however, is resentful, makes false accusations, and spreads negativity. The author is now considering cutting the friendship, which would affect the friend's job and financial situation. \n\nIs the author at fault for ending the friendship? Well, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship with someone who is toxic and spreading lies. The friend's actions are clearly negative, and the author has a right to distance themselves, especially if the friend is being abusive. However, the potential consequence is that the friend might lose her job. But the author's parents might have already known that the friend is underperforming, and it's their decision whether to keep her employed. The author isn't directly causing the job loss; the friend's poor performance is the reason. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end a toxic friendship. The friend's behavior is the main issue here. The author has done a lot to support her, but when the friend turns hostile and spreads rumors, it's reasonable to end the relationship. The author isn't responsible for the friend's financial situation beyond offering employment. So the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
