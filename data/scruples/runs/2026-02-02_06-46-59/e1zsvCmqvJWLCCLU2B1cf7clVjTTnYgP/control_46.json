I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off a friend who's been acting resentfully and unkindly. \n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend doesn't. The friend has been receiving support like family vacations, gifts, a car, etc. The author has faced medical issues and depression, which affected their ability to be as active a friend as before. \n\nThe friend started working in the family business, initially with a good offer from the author's parents. But now, the friend is making mistakes, blaming the author, and spreading negative things about them. The friend's attitude has turned toxic, leading the author to want to end the friendship. The author is worried that doing so might lead to the friend losing her job since the parents might not support her as an employee.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author was generous and supportive, but the friend became resentful and unkind. The author is considering cutting ties, possibly leading to the friend losing her job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nThe friend's actions seem to be more in the wrong. She accepted the job, made mistakes, blamed others, and spread malicious rumors. The author tried to defend her and was supportive despite their own health issues. The author's decision to end the friendship is a personal choice, especially given the friend's toxic behavior. The author isn't responsible for the friend's job security; that's the parents' decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending a friendship where the other person has been abusive and resentful. The key is the friend's actions and the author's right to choose their friendships.\n"
