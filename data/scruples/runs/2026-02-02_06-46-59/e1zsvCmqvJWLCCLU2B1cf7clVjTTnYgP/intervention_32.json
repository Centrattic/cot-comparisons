I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author and their friend come from different financial backgrounds. The friend is from a less privileged background, and the author's family has supported her with vacations, gifts, and even buying her a car. The author mentions that their lives have different levels of ease: the author graduated without debt and moved out at 18, while the friend has over $50k in debt and can't move out. The friend has a dog the author is allergic to, so they can't live together. The friend took a job at the author's family business, which was intended to help her, but now there's tension.\n\nThe author has been dealing with medical and mental health issues, which have made them less active as a friend. The friend, who works in the warehouse, is making mistakes and blaming the author for slow order entry. The author defends her, but the friend becomes resentful, calling the author a spoiled attention-seeker and spreading negative things about them. The author is considering cutting off the friendship and acknowledges that if they do, their parents might stop supporting the friend, leading to her potential job loss.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. The author's family has been supportive of the friend, providing financial assistance. The friend accepted a job at the family business, which was meant to help her. However, the friend's performance is subpar, and she's making mistakes. The author defends her, which is understandable given their long-term friendship.\n\n2. The friend's behavior has become toxic. She's spreading negativity, making derogatory comments to the author's boyfriend and others, and pretending to be nice in person. This kind of behavior is unkind and harmful. The author is justified in feeling hurt and frustrated.\n\n3. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which affect their ability to maintain the friendship. They haven't been as active, which might have contributed to the friend's resentment. However, the friend's response is not healthy. The author is trying to manage their own health while supporting their friend, which is commendable.\n\n4. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, even though the author's slowdown is minimal. This shows a lack of personal responsibility on the friend's part. The author is also concerned that cutting ties might lead to the friend losing job support, but that seems like a consequence of the friend's actions.\n\n5. The author is considering ending the friendship due to the friend's toxic behavior. While it's a difficult decision, especially given their history, the friend's actions have crossed into bullying and betrayal. The author has a right to protect their own well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's actions are problematic. She's been unkind, dishonest, and has turned against the author without valid reasons. The author has tried to support and defend her despite the challenges. The friend's resentment seems to stem from jealousy and a lack of acceptance of their different life paths. The author isn't responsible for the friend's issues, especially since they've made efforts to help and maintain the relationship.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship. Given the friend's toxic behavior, the answer seems to lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The author has done their part to support the friend, and now the friend is undermining them. Ending the friendship in this case is a self-preservation move. The author isn't to blame for the friend's poor reactions and choices.\n\nHowever, the user might think the author is in the wrong because of their privileged position. But the author is not directly causing the friend's issues; the friend's struggles are her own, and the author has already extended significant support. The friend's response is inappropriate regardless of the author's circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
