I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their friend. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off family, and their friend doesn't. The friend has been part of their family vacations, received gifts, and even got a car from the author's parents. The author has a successful job in the family business, while the friend is in debt, still with her parents, and works in the warehouse job the author's parents offered. \n\nThe friend's resentment seems to stem from comparing their different life circumstances. The author has been trying to defend the friend at work despite her mistakes, but the friend is now blaming the author for her issues. The friend is spreading negative things about the author, and the author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that would lead to the friend losing her job and support.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author has been generous, offering support and a job. However, the author might be using their position to protect the friend at work, even when the friend is making errors. The friend's behavior is clearly hostile and unfounded, but the author's decision to end the friendship might be a self-serving move to avoid responsibility for the friend's job.\n\nBut wait, the author is also dealing with personal issues and depression. They've tried to be a friend, but the friend is toxic. The friend's actions are undermining the author both personally and professionally. The author's fear of the friend's potential job loss is a concern, but if the friend is already a problematic employee, maybe the author isn't responsible for that outcome. The author might feel justified in cutting ties to protect themselves from the friend's negativity and protect their own mental health.\n\nHowever, there's a question of whether the author is using their privilege to control the friend's situation. By cutting off the friendship, they remove support the friend relies on, which could be seen as cruel. But the friend's behavior has been malicious, and the author has a right to end a toxic relationship. The key here is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship despite knowing the consequences. Since the friend's actions were harmful and the author is trying to protect themselves, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're not causing the friend's issues but are choosing to stop enabling a toxic dynamic. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
