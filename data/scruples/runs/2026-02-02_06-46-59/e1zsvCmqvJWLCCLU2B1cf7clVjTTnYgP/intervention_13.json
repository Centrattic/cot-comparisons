I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author has a friend who's been close for a long time. Their family is well-off, and the friend isn't. The friend has gotten help from the author's family, like vacations, gifts, even a car. The author comes from a privileged background, graduated without debt, moved out at 18, and works in the family business. The friend, on the other hand, has a harder time\u2014struggling in school, $50k in debt, still with parents at 26, and works in the warehouse of the family business after the author's parents offered her a job.\n\nNow, the friend is acting resentful. She blames the author for her mistakes at work, accuses her of being a spoiled attention-seeker, and even tells the boyfriend to break up. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which has affected their ability to maintain their friendship. The author wants to end the friendship but is worried that if they do, the friend might lose her job because the parents might fire her due to her poor performance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend.\n\nLet me break this down. The key points are the friend's resentment and the author's privilege. The friend is in a difficult situation, but she's acting out negatively. The author is trying to defend her at work despite her mistakes, but the friend is blaming her medical issues. The author's main issue is the friend's behavior, which has become toxic. The author is considering ending the friendship, possibly leading to the friend losing her job.\n\nIs the author at fault for choosing to end a toxic relationship? The friend has been hostile and untrue, spreading rumors. The author has a right to distance themselves from someone who is being harmful. However, there's a potential consequence for the friend's job if the author's parents stop supporting her. But the author's parents are the ones employing her; the author isn't the one who hired her. The author's role is as a friend, not an employer. So the author's decision to end the friendship shouldn't directly impact the friend's job unless the parents are influenced by their daughter's relationship. However, the author is not responsible for the friend's employment status. The friend's job performance is her own responsibility. The author is not in the wrong for ending a friendship with someone who is being toxic. The friend's actions have crossed into personal attacks and betrayal, which justifies ending the relationship. The potential consequence for the friend is a result of her own poor performance and bad behavior, not the author's decision to cut her off. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
