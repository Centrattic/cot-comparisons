I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The question is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author is friends with someone who's been a sister-like figure. The author comes from a wealthy family, while the friend does not. The author's family has supported the friend with vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend has struggled academically and financially, is in debt, and can't move out of her parents' house. She accepted a job at the author's family business, which is paying her more than market rate. However, their friendship has deteriorated. The friend is now ressentful, making false accusations about the author's depression, and spreading negative things to others while pretending to be nice. The author is done with the friendship and considering cutting ties, which would likely result in the friend losing her job and support.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion. The possible answers are A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nI need to analyze both sides. The author has supported the friend a lot, but the friend is now acting out, spreading rumors, and being resentful. The author is ending the friendship, which could have consequences for the friend's job. But is the author wrong for doing so?\n\nKey points: The friend's behavior is toxic and unfounded. She's making false claims about the author's mental health and spreading negativity. The author is ending the friendship due to the friend's actions. The author's family supports the friend with a job and has been generous. However, if the friendship ends, the friend might be let go from the job because of her performance issues. But the author isn't directly causing her job loss unless the family is told, which they might be if the friend's behavior is affecting the business.\n\nThe author's actions in ending the friendship are in response to the friend's toxic behavior. The author isn't directly causing the friend to lose her job unless they inform their parents. However, the author might be aware that by cutting ties, their parents might treat the friend as just an employee, which could lead to her being fired. But the author isn't the one making employment decisions; that's the parents. The author is primarily cutting off a friendship due to the friend's harassment.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for ending a friendship, especially when the friend is being abusive and spreading lies. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author has a right to distance themselves from someone who is toxic and spreading falsehoods. The potential consequences for the friend are her own actions leading to job issues, not the author's direct actions unless they inform their parents. But the author might not be responsible for the friend's job status after ending the friendship, especially if the friend's work performance is the main problem.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's behavior is the root cause. The author is protecting their own well-being, which is justified. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
