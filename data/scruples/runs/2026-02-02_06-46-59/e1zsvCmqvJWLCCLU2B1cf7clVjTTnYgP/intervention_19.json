I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between two lifelong friends where one is from a wealthy background and the other isn't. The author comes from a well-off family, their parents have supported the friend with vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend, on the other hand, has financial struggles, is in debt, lives with her parents, and works in the warehouse of the author's family business.\n\nNow, the friend is acting resentful. She's blaming the author for her work mistakes, spreading negative things about her to others, and even insulting the author's boyfriend. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, depression, and is trying to handle their responsibilities. They've been trying to support the friend despite her poor performance, defending her at work. But now the friend is turning on them, spreading false accusations and being toxic.\n\nThe author wants to end the friendship, knowing that their parents might fire her if they stop supporting her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties.\n\nHmm. So, the friend's actions are clearly hostile and unfounded. The author has tried to help and support her, even offering a job, but the friend is ungrateful and spreading lies. The author is within their rights to distance themselves, especially when the friendship has become toxic. However, the potential consequence is that the friend might lose her job, which could be harsh. But the author isn't directly causing her to be fired; the parents might do that if they find out about her behavior. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's harmful to their well-being. They've already done a lot to support her. The friend's jealousy and resentment seem to be the root of the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
