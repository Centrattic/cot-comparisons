I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with a friend. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family and has had an easier life, graduating debt-free thanks to their great-grandpa's funding. The friend, on the other hand, has financial struggles, is in debt, and can't move out because of her dog. The author offered her a job in the family warehouse, which paid well, and she took it. Now, their friendship is breaking down because the friend is resentful, making false accusations about the author's depression, and spreading negative stuff to others. The author is now considering cutting off the friend but is worried about the consequences since their parents might fire her if they stop supporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The friend's behavior seems pretty toxic\u2014spreading rumors, blaming the author for her mistakes, and being fake nice. The author tried to help by offering a job and a place to stay before, but the friend turned down the room because of the dog allergy. The author is in a tough spot with their own health issues but still defends the friend at work despite her poor performance.\n\nThe core question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's actions are clearly problematic. The author isn't obligated to continue being friends with someone who's acting this way. Even though the author is in a better financial position, the friend's resentment and lies are a breach of trust. The author's decision to stop being friends is a personal choice, and while they know it might affect their friend's job, the friend's actions likely contributed to that situation. The author's parents might have been lenient because of their personal relationship, but if that's taken for granted, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
