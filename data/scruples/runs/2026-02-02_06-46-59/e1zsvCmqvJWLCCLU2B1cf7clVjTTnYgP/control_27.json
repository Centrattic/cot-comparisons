I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to cut off their friend. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family and their friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, and even a car from the author's parents. The author mentions that their life has been easier academically and financially, graduating without debt, while the friend has over $50k in debt and can't afford to move out of her parents' house.\n\nThe friend was offered a job by the author's parents at double the expected rate, but since starting there, their relationship has deteriorated. The author has been dealing with personal and medical issues, which have affected their ability to maintain their friendship. The friend, working in the warehouse, is making mistakes and blaming the author for not being fast enough with orders. The author's condition only delays tasks by 30 minutes, which the friend seems to be exaggerating. The friend has become resentful, spreading negative things about the author behind their back and even to the boyfriend. The author is considering cutting ties, knowing that this might lead to the friend losing her job and support from the author's parents.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. The author has offered support in the past, including job opportunities and accommodations like a room. However, the friend's behavior has become toxic, spreading lies and damaging the author's reputation and relationships. The author is also dealing with their own health issues, which have made it hard to maintain the friendship. The friend's resentment might stem from jealousy of the author's better circumstances, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's betrayal and the author's reasonable response. The author isn't doing anything wrong by setting boundaries, especially when the friend is being malicious. The friend's actions are harmful, and cutting ties in this case is a self-preservation step. The author isn't responsible for the friend's resentment; they've done their part by offering support and defending her at work. The friend's decision to spread lies and blame others is her own fault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n"
