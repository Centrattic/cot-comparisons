I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex with a lot of factors.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family and has provided a lot of support to their friend, like family vacations, gifts, and even buying her a car. The author worked in the family business, which they inherited, while the friend struggled with school, debt, and couldn't find a good job. The friend ended up working in the warehouse for the author's parents, which was a better offer than what others were getting.\n\nThe author mentions having medical and personal issues, including depression, which affected their ability to be active as a friend. The friend started making mistakes at work, and the author defended her. However, the friend became resentful, accused the author of being faking depression, insulted the author to others, and even told the author's boyfriend negative things. The author now wants to end the friendship, but they're worried that this would lead to the friend losing her job if the parents stop supporting her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author has been supportive in the past, but the friend is now acting out of resentment and spreading negativity. The author is now cutting ties, possibly because of the friend's toxic behavior. However, the author is also aware that their parents' support is tied to the friend's employment. So, there's a conflict between personal relationships and professional boundaries.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've tried to be a good friend, defended them at work, and offered help with housing (though the friend declined). The friend's actions are hostile and unprofessional, especially in the workplace. The author has a right to distance themselves from someone who is spreading lies and being hostile, especially if it's affecting their well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel envious of the author's success and support. But that doesn't justify the toxic behavior. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's turning toxic. The key here is that the friend's actions are unprofessional and harmful, and the author is justified in ending the friendship to protect their own mental health and work environment. The author isn't responsible for the friend's current job situation; the friend chose to take the job and now is struggling. The author's decision to cut ties might be harsh, but it's a personal choice based on the friend's behavior, not the friend's financial situation directly. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship given the circumstances.\n"
