I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a close friend who now works for the author's family business. The friend has become resentful, blaming the author for her mistakes and spreading negative things. The author is considering ending the friendship, knowing that her parents might then fire the friend.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy background, and the friend does not. The friend has been part of their family vacations and received gifts, even a car. The author's parents offered her a job in the warehouse, which was well-paid. However, the friend isn't performing well and is making mistakes. The author defends her at work but is dealing with personal medical issues, which might slow down her work pace slightly. The friend accuses the author of being a spoiled attention-seeker and spreads rumors, which is why the author wants to cut ties.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author has a right to prioritize her own well-being, especially dealing with medical issues. The friend has been unkind and spreading rumors, which is toxic. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's harmful. However, there's a potential consequence: the author's parents might fire the friend if they stop supporting her. The author is aware of this but still wants to end the friendship. That raises a question about the impact on the friend's job, but is the author responsible for that? The friend chose to take the job and is struggling; the author is just an employee advocating for her. The friend's actions (spreading rumors) might justify the author ending the friendship regardless of the consequences. \n\nOn the flip side, the author should consider if there's a way to support the friend while protecting herself. But given the friend's behavior, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The author isn't causing the friend's problems; the friend's own poor performance and resentment are the issues. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties. Answer B.\n"
