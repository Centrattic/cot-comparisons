It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a specific pizza they were craving, offering it to their girlfriend, and then getting upset when she took toppings off all the slices.\n\nFirst, the author ordered the pizza they wanted, which they paid for, and their girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything. Then, the girlfriend took toppings off every piece, which the author found inconsiderate. The key points here are communication and expectations. \n\nThe author didn't mention beforehand that they wanted to eat the pizza as is, so maybe there was a lack of clear communication. The girlfriend thought it was okay to modify the pizza since she didn't take the whole piece. But the author's reaction was anger, calling her selfish. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might not have realized the significance of the pizza to the author. The argument escalated, bringing up old issues. While the author's anger might be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza, the author's perspective is that their request was ignored. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, but she might not have intended to be selfish. The author's reaction might be disproportionate, but the situation is subjective. \n\nI think the main issue is both parties miscommunicated their expectations. The author didn't clarify their need to eat the pizza as ordered, and the girlfriend took it upon herself to modify it without asking. However, the author's anger leading to a fight could be seen as overreacting. But since the girlfriend altered the pizza in a way the author didn't expect, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nBut considering the argument escalated and the author called the girlfriend selfish, which might have been unnecessary, the author might share some responsibility. However, the girlfriend's action was the catalyst. It's a bit of a 50-50, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that the author ordered the pizza and didn't communicate their need to keep it whole, maybe the blame isn't all on the author. But the argument started with the author's reaction. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate without discussion, but the author did call her out. However, the initial action of the girlfriend was the main issue, so the author's anger isn't entirely unwarranted. But since the author reacted with anger and called her selfish, which might be too harsh, maybe A is the answer. Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
