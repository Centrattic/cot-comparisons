It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza between a guy and his girlfriend. The guy ordered pizza he wanted, she said she'd have some of what he gets, then later she took toppings off all the pieces, and he got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author ordered a specific pizza he was craving, which was expensive. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of what he gets. So he orders, eats two pieces, then finds out she took toppings off every piece. He reacts angrily, calling her selfish, and they argue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author might think he's justified because he ordered the pizza he wanted, expecting to share, but she didn't just take a little from one or two pieces, but all the toppings off every piece. That seems excessive and disrespectful. However, maybe she didn't communicate her intentions clearly. She might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted since he had already eaten some.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't clarify that he wanted to eat the pizza as is. If she agreed to have some of what he ordered, maybe she should have communicated if she needed to modify it. But she did say she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author assumed she meant taking from one or two pieces, not all. So maybe the misunderstanding led to the conflict.\n\nBut then, even if there was a misunderstanding, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and starting a big argument might be over the top. It's just pizza. However, considering the effort and expense, and the fact that the girlfriend modified the pizza in a way he found unacceptable, his frustration is somewhat understandable.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she took toppings from all pieces, making the pizza he wanted less enjoyable. But her response that she didn't take all the cheese and that it's still edible might be valid. She might have felt she was being reasonable by taking only some toppings.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's anger was justified. The problem might stem from unmet expectations and poor communication. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched, and she didn't clarify her request beyond not wanting a whole piece. Both parties might have contributed to the misunderstanding. However, the act of removing toppings from every piece could be seen as selfish, especially if the author paid for the pizza and had a specific craving.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's some fault on both sides, the girlfriend's actions were more inconsiderate. The author's anger might be a result of feeling his request wasn't respected. However, his reaction (calling her selfish and escalating the argument) might be disproportionate. But given the scenario, the main issue is the girlfriend's actions. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
