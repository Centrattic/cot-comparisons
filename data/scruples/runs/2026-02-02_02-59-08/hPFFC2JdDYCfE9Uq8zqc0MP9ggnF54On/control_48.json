When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a pizza fight between the author and their girlfriend. The author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is a bit expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no, but would have some of whatever the author got. \n\nThe author ordered the pizza, took two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When she came back, she didn't eat, and later the author found out she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The author now wonders if they were wrong to react that way.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author was excited about the pizza, ordered it, and shared their meal with the girlfriend. The girlfriend initially said she would have some of whatever the author got. But when the pizza arrived, she didn't take a piece. Instead, she later took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt this was inconsiderate, especially since the pizza was a special, more expensive choice. The girlfriend thought the author had already had their share and didn't mind if she took the toppings. The argument escalated, with the author feeling the girlfriend was selfish and the girlfriend saying the author was overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. The girlfriend did say she would have some of the pizza, so maybe the author expected her to take a slice. However, she ended up not taking a slice but instead taking toppings. The author might feel that the girlfriend was being wasteful or disrespectful to the meal they had ordered. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since the author had already eaten, she was entitled to take what she wanted from the remaining pizza. \n\nBut there are some factors here. The pizza was ordered by the author, and the girlfriend had agreed to have some of it, so maybe the expectation was that she would take a slice. However, the girlfriend instead took toppings, which the author found offensive. The key question is whether the author overreacted by calling her selfish and getting angry, or if the girlfriend was indeed inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author could have asked the girlfriend if she wanted a slice instead of assuming she would take toppings. However, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already eaten, she could take the toppings without needing a slice. The problem arose from a miscommunication. \n\nBut the argument escalated. The author's reaction was to call the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which the girlfriend found childish. The author might have overreacted, especially since the girlfriend didn't take all the cheese off the pizza and the author had already eaten their share. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece might be seen as disrespectful to the author's purchase and the meal they were both supposed to share. \n\nIn relationships, expectations can differ. The author might feel that their choice of a special pizza was important, and the girlfriend's actions undermined that. The girlfriend might not see it as a big deal. The question is whether the author's anger was justified. \n\nOn one hand, it's just pizza, and getting into a big argument over it might be overreacting. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful and the author felt disrespected, their reaction might be understandable. However, the author could have handled it more calmly, perhaps by discussing it without name-calling. But the girlfriend's actions could also be seen as selfish, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the girlfriend did take from the pizza in a way that the author found inconsiderate. However, the author's response (calling her selfish and escalating the argument) might have been too harsh. But the initial action by the girlfriend was the trigger. The answer depends on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Since the author felt disrespected, their anger isn't entirely unwarranted, but the way they handled it could be better. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was indeed being inconsiderate, then the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
