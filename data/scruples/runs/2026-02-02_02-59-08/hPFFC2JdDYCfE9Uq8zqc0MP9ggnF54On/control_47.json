It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off the pieces. He thought she meant a few pieces, but found out she removed toppings from all the pizza. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend said she would eat \"some of whatever\" he ordered. She might have expected to have her own pizza, but he ordered one pizza. However, he didn't clarify if she wanted to share or if she wanted her own order. Maybe he assumed she would just have his pizza, but that's a bit of an assumption. \n\nWhen she took toppings off, he was upset because he thought she was being inconsiderate. But maybe she was trying to avoid the expense of ordering her own pizza or didn't want to eat the whole piece. She might not see it as selfish if she thought it was okay to modify the pizza she's eating. However, removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as altering his meal without his consent. \n\nThe key points are communication and expectations. He didn't specify if she needed to order her own pizza, and she didn't clarify her preferences. His reaction might be over the top because it's just pizza, but her actions did modify his meal. On the other hand, his anger leading to a fight might be disproportionate. \n\nThe girlfriend's confusion and his calling her selfish could escalate the situation. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings calmly instead of getting angry. However, her not respecting his meal by altering it all could also be an issue. \n\nI think both could be at fault to some extent. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because his meal was being modified without his consent. But his reaction could have been more measured. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might depend on the perspective. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author's anger is valid. But if the author didn't clarify expectations, maybe he shares some responsibility. \n\nGiven the details, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend altered his meal without considering his preferences, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the reaction could have been more appropriate. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the main issue is her actions, the answer might be B.\n"
