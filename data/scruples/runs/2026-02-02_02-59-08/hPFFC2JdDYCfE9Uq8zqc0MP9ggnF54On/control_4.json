It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The girlfriend ordered pizza, the author ordered a specific pizza, and the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted pizza, she said no, but then later took the toppings and cheese off every piece. The key points are: did the author have a right to expect that the pizza wouldn't be modified without his knowledge? The girlfriend didn't ask for permission, but maybe she assumed since she said she would have some of whatever he got. But then she modified all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's defense is that the girlfriend was selfish for not asking or considering his preference. The girlfriend's defense is that he already had his pieces, so she didn't take all the cheese, and it's still edible. She also thought he was overreacting.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. The author's anger stems from the fact that the pizza was modified without his knowledge. The girlfriend didn't communicate her intention to take toppings off. But on the other hand, the pizza was ordered for both of them, so maybe she had the right to adjust it to her taste. However, modifying all the pieces might be excessive. The author might have been inconsiderate by not checking if she wanted to order her own pizza, but he asked before ordering. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as not respecting his choice of pizza. But she didn't take the whole pizza, just the toppings. The argument might be about expectations and communication. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for being upset, but maybe overreacted. The girlfriend should have communicated her preference instead of altering the pizza. But the author could have considered that she might want a different modification. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe both are at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author called her selfish and started the fight, which escalated things, maybe he's in the wrong. But the girlfriend did something inconsiderate. Hmm. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some contexts, modifying shared food without permission is seen as inconsiderate. But the girlfriend didn't take the pizza, just adjusted it. The author might have been wrong to call her selfish without discussing first. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful. The answer could be B. I need to weigh the factors. The author ordered the pizza, but the girlfriend altered it. The author's anger is about his preferences being ignored. The girlfriend's response of not caring and being confusing might have been the bigger issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
