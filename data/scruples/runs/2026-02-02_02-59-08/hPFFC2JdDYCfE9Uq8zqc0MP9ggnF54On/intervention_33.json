It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering pizza, the girlfriend not wanting to order her own but then taking toppings off all the pieces. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was starving, ordered a specific pizza, asked the girlfriend if she wanted something, and she declined. He took two pieces, watched TV, and when he checked later, she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author ordered the pizza because he wanted it, and the girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything. But when she later took toppings off all the pieces, he was upset. The main issue is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nOn one hand, he paid for the pizza, and she didn't order her own. Taking toppings off every piece might seem like she's using it without consideration. But she was eating it, just modifying it. However, the author might feel that his craving was important, and she took without asking, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't order her own pizza and was using what was available. She might feel entitled to use the food they had. The author's frustration could stem from the fact that he ordered it specifically for himself, expecting it to be his main meal, and she altered it in a way that affected his enjoyment.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to assess. Arguments for him being in the wrong: he started a fight over something trivial, overreacted, didn't consider her actions as harmless. Arguments against: he was paying for the pizza he ordered, expected it to be his, and her actions were indeed inconsiderate without communication.\n\nCommunication seems key here. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza for himself only. He asked if she wanted something, and she declined. Then when she took the toppings, he didn't check first. Maybe he should have asked if she wanted some instead of assuming she wouldn't take any. However, she did take it without asking, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nIn relationships, expectations matter. If they usually share food, she might expect to use the pizza. If not, then her taking without asking is the issue. The author's anger might be justified if they had prior understanding that food should be shared appropriately. But if there's no such expectation, he might have overreacted.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend took toppings off all pieces, which is more than just taking a few. That could make the pizza less enjoyable for the author. However, she didn't take the whole pizza, just modified it. The author's reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be harsh, but his feelings are valid if he felt his needs were unconsidered.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a tricky situation. Both parties might have some responsibility. The author could have clarified that the pizza was his order and if she wanted some, he could offer. She could have asked if she wanted to take some. But since she took without asking, that's inconsiderate. However, his reaction leading to an argument might be disproportionate. So, depending on the relationship dynamics, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps she's also at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is that he got angry over her taking without asking, then he's justified. But if the fight was overreacted, maybe he is in the wrong. Considering that she took toppings off all pieces without communication, the author's anger is somewhat justified, so he might not be in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B (No), but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
