It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza because they were starving and shared it with their girlfriend. The gf said she wanted some of whatever he got, but when he ordered, she ended up taking toppings off every piece. The author felt this was selfish and called her inconsiderate, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, considering the actions of both parties. The author ordered pizza, maybe expecting to share it. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't specify her preferences beforehand and then altered the pizza she wasn't eating. But she did eat two pieces, as per the initial setup? Wait, the author ate two pieces first, then went to grab more. The girlfriend was in the kitchen, and when he checked, she said she didn't take a whole piece but took toppings off all pieces. That seems like she modified the shared meal without considering the author's preferences or the fact that he was eating it.\n\nBut did the author overreact? The girlfriend didn't eat anything, just took toppings off all the pizza. The author might feel that his meal was compromised. However, the girlfriend might have thought she could adjust the pizza to her preference. The question is about whether the author's anger was justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author was hungry and had paid for the pizza, expecting it to be in good condition. On the other hand, the girlfriend had the right to adjust her own meal. However, altering all the pizza pieces might be inconsiderate. The argument escalated, but the author's reaction was calling her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a valid feeling. The gf's response of being annoyed and calling him a child might not help.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend didn't communicate her preferences beforehand and altered the shared meal without consideration, maybe the author's reaction is reasonable. However, the author could have discussed it calmly instead of starting a fight. The key here is whether the argument was proportionate. Since it's just pizza, maybe both sides have valid points, but the author's choice to escalate into a fight over the situation could be seen as the issue. But the girlfriend's actions also contributed.\n\nHmm. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some contexts, sharing pizza and adjusting it might be okay, but if it affects the other person's meal, it's not. The author's anger might be justified because his meal was modified without his consent. But the way he handled it (calling her names) could be where he's in the wrong. However, the initial act of altering the pizza was inconsiderate. So maybe both are wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author's anger stems from a valid reaction to his meal being modified without consideration, even if his approach was harsh. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the fight was over a minor issue. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the gf was inconsiderate, the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. So maybe B.\n"
