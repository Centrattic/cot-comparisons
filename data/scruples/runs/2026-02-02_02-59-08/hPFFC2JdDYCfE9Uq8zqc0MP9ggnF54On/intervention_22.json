It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The story is about a couple where the guy ordered pizza from a specific place he wanted, asked his girlfriend if she wanted some, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two slices, then went to watch TV. His girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, he noticed she took toppings off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, they argued.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. I need to decide between A or B. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy was really craving pizza from a specific, more expensive place. He ordered it for himself and offered her some, which she accepted by saying she wanted \"some of whatever he got.\" When he ate two slices, he assumed the rest was for both. But she ended up taking toppings off all the slices. He got angry because he felt she was being selfish, and she was confused and thought he was overreacting.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Well, communication is key in relationships. The guy didn't clarify that he wanted to eat the pizza himself, even though he offered her some. She might have thought he was going to share the remaining slices, but he ate two first. Then she tried to use the remaining slices but modified them, which he found offensive. But maybe he should have discussed his expectations first. If he was really craving that pizza, maybe he should have ordered enough for himself and then maybe another round if she wanted, or communicated that he wanted to eat it all. On the other hand, she took toppings off all the slices, which seems like she was being inconsiderate in a way that affects the guy's meal. But was his reaction proportionate? It's just pizza, but the way she modified all the slices might have been a big deal. However, the argument escalated because he called her names and she didn't expect it. Maybe both could have handled it better. But the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. If he ordered the pizza with the intention to eat it himself, maybe he shouldn't have been surprised if she didn't get her own. But he did offer her some. So maybe he's partially at fault for not clarifying. However, her taking toppings off all the pieces after he had already eaten his share might be the bigger issue. But the argument is about who started it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe because he shouldn't have ordered pizza for himself without ensuring she could have her own, or being too harsh. I think the answer could be A (author in the wrong) for not being clear and overreacting, or B (not in the wrong) because her actions were disrespectful. It's a bit of a gray area. But in the story, the guy did ask her if she wanted something, which she said no, but then took from his order. So maybe she's at fault for not getting her own. But the guy ordered it for himself, so perhaps her modifying all the slices was inconsiderate, but his reaction was also harsh. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author did something wrong, like not being clear or blowing it out of proportion. If B, then the girlfriend was in the wrong. Given the story, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been too strong. However, the initial act of the girlfriend taking toppings off all the slices is a key point. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she did something that affected his meal. But maybe the author should have ordered enough for both or not eaten two first. Hmm. I think the key point is that the author ordered the pizza for himself, but offered her some. She said she'd have some of whatever he got, so he ate two, and she took from the remaining. But she took toppings off all the pieces, which made them inedible for him. So he had the right to be upset because she made his meal inedible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
