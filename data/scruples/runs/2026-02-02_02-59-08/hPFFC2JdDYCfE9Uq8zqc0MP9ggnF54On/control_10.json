It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.

My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. So he ordered, ate two pieces, then went back to the living room. \n\nThe girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When she came back, she didn't eat, and later when the author went to the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. The author is now wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she was taking some toppings off a couple of pieces, but she did it to all of them. The girlfriend thought it was okay since she didn't take all the cheese off and that the author had already eaten. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might feel that the girlfriend didn't respect his choice to order his favorite pizza and modified it in a way that he didn't expect. The girlfriend might think that since the author had already eaten his share, she could do what she wanted with the remaining pizza. \n\nBut there's a problem with how the author reacted. He called her names and escalated the argument, which probably made things worse. However, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings and cheese from all pieces might have been inconsiderate, especially since the pizza was specific and expensive. \n\nThe author's anger over something that seems trivial might be seen as overreacting, but if the pizza was important to him and she didn't communicate her intentions, his frustration is understandable. The main issue here is lack of communication. The author didn't clarify if she wanted to take toppings off before he ordered, and the girlfriend didn't ask or inform him after he ordered. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have contributed. The author assumed she would take only a little, and the girlfriend assumed it was okay to modify all the pizza. But the author's reaction was more aggressive. However, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as not considering his preferences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did order the pizza with the understanding that she might have some. By not checking if she wanted to modify the pizza or if that was okay, he might have contributed to the misunderstanding. But his anger and name-calling escalated the situation. On the other hand, the girlfriend's action of altering all the pizza without discussing it first is also inconsiderate. \n\nI think both have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the author's reaction is the main issue. If B (no), then the girlfriend's actions were the problem. \n\nGiven that the author ordered the pizza with the understanding that she would have some, and she modified it without consulting him, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, his response was harsh. But the initial act of modifying the pizza without discussion might be the root of the problem. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a tough call. Maybe the answer is B (no), because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was also inappropriate. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. Since both have some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn these situations, typically, if someone gets angry over a partner's inconsiderate action, they might not be entirely at fault. However, the way they reacted (calling names, escalating) often makes them at fault. But the initial action of the girlfriend was also problematic. \n\nI think the answer is B (no), because the author's anger was a reaction to his partner's inconsiderate act. However, his response was harsh. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and both have some responsibility, but the main issue was her action, the answer might be B. But maybe A because his reaction was inappropriate. \n\nWait, in AITA scenarios, often the person who acts out in anger is considered at fault. So if the author called his girlfriend selfish and they ended up in a big argument, he might be seen as the one who escalated it unnecessarily. But the root cause was her action. \n\nThis is tricky. I think the answer is B (no) because the author had a valid reason to be upset, but his reaction was excessive. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, if the answer is B, then no. But maybe the answer is A (yes) because he started the fight over something trivial. \n\nI'm going to go with B (no), because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while harsh, was a response to that. But in reality, both could have handled it better. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongness, so B might be the answer.\n"
