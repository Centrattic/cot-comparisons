It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an argument over pizza. The author ordered expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out their girlfriend took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author asked if the girlfriend wanted something, she said she'd have some of what he gets. He ordered, ate his two pieces, and assumed she would take toppings from a couple of pieces. But instead, she took toppings off all the pieces. The author got upset because she took too much, leaving him with less, and the girlfriend was confused and defensive.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece, so maybe she thought taking some toppings off the pieces was okay. But the problem is she took from every piece, which left the author with nothing. The author might feel that the shared pizza was for both of them, so taking from all the pieces is taking more than her share. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. However, the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and inconsiderate\u2014might be seen as overreacting, even though the situation was frustrating. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her actions, which could be inconsiderate. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author ordered the pizza for both, expecting they would share. If the girlfriend took all the toppings, even if not all the cheese, she might have been selfish. The author's anger could be justified as he was left with less. However, his response (calling her names and escalating the argument) might be the wrong approach. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness suggest she didn't see her actions as wrong. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both have some responsibility. The author could have clarified his expectations earlier, and the girlfriend should have communicated her actions. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author's anger might be justified, but his response might have been harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his anger was disproportionate. Since the girlfriend took all the toppings, leaving him with less, his anger isn't entirely unfounded. So he might not be in the wrong. But maybe the way he handled it was wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Given the scenario, I think the answer is B (no), because the author's reaction, while perhaps aggressive, was to a selfish act. However, there's a nuance here. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong. But in the context of the question, which asks if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B.\n"
