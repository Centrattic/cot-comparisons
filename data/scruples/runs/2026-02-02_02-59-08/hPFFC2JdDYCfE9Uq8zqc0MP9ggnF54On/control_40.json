It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nSo the situation is the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They told their girlfriend they were going to order and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but offered to have some of the pizza they get. Then the author orders, eats a couple of pieces, and when they go to the kitchen, they find the girlfriend has taken toppings and cheese off every piece. They got angry, called her selfish, and a fight ensued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that their girlfriend violated the unspoken agreement that they could have the pizza as ordered. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was allowed to take some toppings from the remaining pizza without the author's knowledge. She might not have realized that the author was sensitive about this because of the price or their craving. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that their girlfriend wasn't considerate, not just about the pizza but maybe about their feelings. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness might indicate she didn't see the issue the same way. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe they overreacted. The girlfriend didn't take all the pizza; she took some toppings off each piece. The author ordered the pizza, paid for it, and expected to enjoy it as is. However, maybe there's a lack of communication here. The author didn't specify that they wanted the pizza untouched, and the girlfriend might not have realized the importance of it. \n\nBut considering that the author was clear about their craving and the expense, and the girlfriend took from all the remaining pieces without asking, the author's reaction might be justified. On the other hand, the author could have handled it calmly instead of escalating into a fight. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend took the pizza without consideration for the author's feelings, then the author's anger is a response to her inconsiderate action. But if the author's reaction was disproportionate, then maybe they're at fault. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the key points are that the author had a specific craving for expensive pizza, asked the girlfriend if she wanted some, she declined but later took from the pizza. The author felt it was selfish, which might be a valid feeling. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, which could have contributed to the argument. \n\nSo, considering the situation, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the way the author handled it might have been harsh. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just about the reaction. The main issue is whether the author's initial anger was justified. Since the girlfriend took from the pizza without permission, the author's anger might be reasonable. Therefore, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But maybe the answer is A if the author overreacted. \n\nWait, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then the author isn't wrong for being upset. However, the argument might have been avoided if the author communicated better. But the core issue is about the girlfriend's action. \n\nIn many cases, when someone pays for something and another person uses it without consent, the first person has a right to be upset. So, the author's anger might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B. But I need to be careful. Sometimes, people can overreact, but in this case, the girlfriend's action might be seen as taking without asking. So, maybe the author isn't at fault.\n"
