It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered a specific expensive pizza they were craving, offered the girlfriend some, she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, then she came back after being in the kitchen and he noticed she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The author ordered pizza for himself, knowing it was a specific place he craved. He offered the girlfriend some, she said yes. He ate two pieces, then she took toppings off all the pieces. He's upset about that.\n\nPossible angles: Communication. Did he clarify what he expected? The girlfriend thought she could take some toppings, not realizing he wanted her to have a piece. Maybe she didn't know he wanted her to eat the pizza as is. The author's reaction was to call her selfish and get angry, which might be overreacting. However, he might feel disrespected since she took what he had ordered without asking, even though she said she wanted some. But he already gave her the option, and she didn't specify her preference. Maybe the problem is that she took the toppings without asking, modifying his pizza. But he didn't set boundaries. On the other hand, she might have thought it was okay since he had two pieces left. The author's anger might be disproportionate, but maybe not entirely his fault if he communicated his preferences clearly.\n\nAnother point: He was eating in the living room, she was in the kitchen. He didn't notice she was in the kitchen and then came back. He asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings. But she didn't communicate that she was modifying the pizza. He could have checked with her, but he was angry when he found out. Maybe the author is wrong because he didn't explain that he wanted her to eat the pizza as a whole, not just the toppings. Alternatively, she could have asked for the toppings instead of taking them. But he ordered the pizza for both, so she might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted. However, modifying someone else's food without consent is generally frowned upon. The key here is communication. The author didn't clarify his expectations, and she didn't ask. So maybe both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If he overreacted, then he is in the wrong. But if he felt his food was taken without consent, maybe not. However, since she had already said she wanted some of whatever he got, he could have ordered extra or made sure she got what she wanted. Since he ordered for both, maybe she was within her rights to take some. But modifying the pizza completely is disrespectful. So the author's anger might be justified, but his reaction (calling her selfish, arguing) could be seen as over the top. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the modification was indeed disrespectful. But maybe A (in the wrong) because he didn't communicate clearly. Hmm. It's tricky. I think the main issue is that the author didn't set boundaries about how the pizza would be shared. He assumed she'd eat a piece, but she took toppings. So maybe he's in the wrong for not clarifying. Alternatively, she should have asked. But since she initially said she'd have some of whatever he got, he should have made sure she got a piece. So the answer might be A. But the user thinks the author is wrong. I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
