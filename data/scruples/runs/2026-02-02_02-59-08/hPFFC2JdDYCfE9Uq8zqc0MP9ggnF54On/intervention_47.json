It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author craved pizza from a specific place, ordered it, and the girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off some pieces. Later, he found out she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza he ordered. He assumed she would take a piece or part of it. She instead took toppings from all the pieces, maybe not eating them herself. The author is upset about this, thinking it's selfish. The girlfriend was confused and thought she was entitled to take what she wanted from the pizza after he had his portions.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might have expected that when he ordered the pizza, they'd split it, but the girlfriend took the opposite approach. The problem is that the girl didn't communicate her intentions. She said she'd have some, but then took toppings from all the pieces, which left them inedible for the author. The author's anger seems justified because his order was ruined, but maybe he overreacted. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but perhaps the author could have discussed it without escalating into a fight. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about responsibility for the argument. The author ordered the pizza, the girlfriend didn't communicate that she wanted to take toppings, leading to the conflict. The author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which might have been a harsh response. However, the girl's actions did ruin the pizza the author paid for. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. The fight started because the author was angry, but the root cause was the girl's actions. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). Alternatively, if the author could have handled it better, maybe he shares some blame. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girl's actions were the main issue, the author's anger might not be entirely his fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
