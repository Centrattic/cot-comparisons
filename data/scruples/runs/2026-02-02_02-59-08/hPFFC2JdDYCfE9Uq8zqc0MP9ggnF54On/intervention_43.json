It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over the pizza is in the wrong. Let me look at the details again.\n\nThe author ordered pizza from a specific place they wanted, which was more expensive. They told their girlfriend they were starving and asked if she wanted anything. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, came back, and didn't eat. When he asked, she said she took toppings off, but he thought she took from one or two pieces. But in reality, she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is asking to evaluate both sides. Let's consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza he really wanted, which was a personal choice. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, and she declined, saying she'd have some of what he got. Then he ordered it. The assumption here is that she might take a piece or share from his order. However, when she didn't take a piece but instead took toppings from all the pieces, that's where the conflict arose.\n\nThe girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all the pizza pieces could be seen as altering the meal that he specifically ordered and paid for. This might make him feel his preferences were disregarded. However, she might argue that he was the one who ordered it for both of them, so she was entitled to adjust it as she wanted.\n\nBut wait, the author did mention he asked her if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. That implies she agreed to the order. But when he ordered, did he clarify that he wanted the pizza as is, or did he expect her to take a piece or not take any? The girlfriend might have thought that since he ordered it for her, she could modify it without affecting his enjoyment. But the author's frustration comes from the fact that she altered all the pieces, making them unsuitable for him.\n\nIn terms of fairness, maybe the author should have considered that when he ordered the pizza, he was bringing it home for both, and she had a right to adjust her share. However, modifying all the pieces affects his ability to enjoy the pizza as ordered. It's a balance between sharing and respecting personal choices.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the pizza as ordered. If he had mentioned that he didn't want her altering the pieces, maybe the situation could have been avoided. But the girlfriend also didn't ask for his preferences when she started modifying the pizza.\n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The girlfriend felt he was overreacting. The key here is whether altering the pizza without consent was selfish or if the author should have communicated his needs better.\n\nIn relationships, expecting others to understand unspoken expectations can lead to conflicts. The author might have assumed she'd take a piece and leave the rest, but she acted differently. The girlfriend's action, while perhaps not malicious, disrupted his meal. However, the author's response was to confront her harshly instead of addressing the issue calmly.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's anger stems from his expectations not being met, but he could have been clearer about his needs. The girlfriend altered the pizza without considering his preferences, but she might not have realized the impact. Both sides have some responsibility here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it's because he overreacted. If B (No), because her actions were inconsiderate.\n\nI think the main issue is that the author didn't communicate his preferences when ordering, leading to a misunderstanding. But the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza was inconsiderate towards his preferences. However, since the author ordered it without specifying how it should be handled, he might share some responsibility. The girlfriend's action was selfish in a way, but the author's reaction was also disproportionate. It's a bit of a grey area.\n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. Since he ordered the pizza he wanted, and she altered it without discussion, his frustration is valid. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and escalating the argument might be where he's at fault. Alternatively, if her action was genuinely inconsiderate, then he's not wrong to be upset.\n\nI'm leaning towards thinking the author is not in the wrong (B) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But maybe the answer is A because he should have communicated his needs better. Hmm. It's tricky. Maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe key point is that the author ordered the pizza he wanted, expecting to share it with his girlfriend. When she modified all the pieces without discussion, it ruined his meal. The girlfriend's action was selfish, but the author's response was harsh. However, the initial act of the girlfriend was inconsiderate. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
