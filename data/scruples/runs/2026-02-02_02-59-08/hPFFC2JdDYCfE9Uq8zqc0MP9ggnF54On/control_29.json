It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific place they wanted, even though it's more expensive. They told their girlfriend they were getting pizza and offered her something. She declined but said she'd have some of what they got. Then, when the pizza arrives, the author takes two pieces and eats them. The girlfriend, who was in the kitchen for a while, comes back and starts eating. The author later finds out she took toppings and cheese off every piece, which made them angry. The girlfriend was confused and thought it was okay because she didn't take all the cheese off and the author already had their pieces.\n\nNow, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend took from the pizza without directly being given permission, but she had said earlier she wanted some. However, the author might have expected her to take a piece or ask for a specific type. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the author had a specific craving and paid for the pizza. But maybe the author could have clarified their expectations earlier. However, the girlfriend's behavior of taking without asking might be the issue here. The author's anger might be justified because their personal pizza was modified without their consent, even if it was shared. The girlfriend's confusion might be valid, but her action still shows a lack of consideration. The argument might have escalated unnecessarily, but the root cause is mutual misunderstanding. However, the author's anger might not be entirely their fault since the girlfriend took without permission. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
