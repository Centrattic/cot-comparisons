It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said no but would have some of what he gets. He takes two pieces, she's in the kitchen a while, then when he goes back, she's taken toppings off every slice. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue. The author is trying to say that her actions were inconsiderate, but others might see it as overreacting.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she would take some toppings from one or two pieces, but she took from all. Maybe she didn't realize he would be upset? Or maybe she thought it was okay to adjust the pizza to her liking without considering his feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions could be seen as not respecting his choice of pizza, especially since he was excited about it. On the other hand, she might not have thought it was a big deal, just modifying the food to suit her taste. The author's reaction is based on her altering the pizza he paid for and wanted to eat, which he found selfish. But is getting angry over that justified? \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might have been too quick to anger, especially since the situation is about food, which can be trivial. However, the girlfriend's behavior of taking toppings off all the slices might have been a breach of unspoken agreement, especially since she initially said she would eat some of what he ordered. Maybe she didn't consider that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. \n\nThe author's anger could stem from feeling that she disrespected his choice and the effort he took to get the pizza. But maybe he should have clarified his expectations earlier, like when she was in the kitchen, instead of waiting until after she modified the pizza. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend might have thought it was fine to adjust the pizza to her taste, not realizing how much it bothered him. The author's response of calling her selfish and a child might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author felt that she shouldn't alter the pizza without permission, he should have mentioned it earlier. Conversely, if the girlfriend wanted to modify the pizza, she should have asked. Both might share some responsibility. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, and they ended up in a big argument, maybe the author did overreact. The situation is about pizza, which isn't a major issue. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for blowing it out of proportion, even if the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. \n\nBut then again, if the girlfriend took actions that went against what he expected, maybe the author's feelings are valid. However, the reaction is what's being questioned. The author's anger led to a fight, so maybe the way they handled it was wrong. \n\nI think the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the situation is trivial, and the author's reaction was disproportionate. But wait, maybe it's B because the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, and the author's anger is justified. \n\nThis is tricky. The key is whether the author's reaction was inconsiderate. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger is a response to that. However, escalating to a big argument over something so minor might be the author's fault. \n\nI'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong. They could have handled it differently without a fight. But others might say the girlfriend was wrong first, making the author's reaction justified. \n\nBut according to the user's own thought, they think the author is in the wrong, which might influence me. However, I need to be objective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the fight started because of the author's reaction, then maybe they are in the wrong. Even if the girlfriend did something inconsiderate, the author's response was to call her selfish and argue, so they started the fight. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
