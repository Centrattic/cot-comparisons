It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering expensive pizza, eating two pieces, and then finding out their girlfriend took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and the argument escalated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because they were craving it from a specific place, which might be a personal preference. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever. The author might have expected her to take a piece or maybe some toppings, but instead, she took toppings off all the pieces. \n\nThe girlfriend's action of removing toppings from every piece is unusual. Normally, if someone shares food, they might take a piece or maybe some toppings from one piece. Taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as wasteful or inconsiderate because it reduces the value of the pizza for the person who ordered it, especially since it was expensive. The author's frustration might stem from feeling that their effort and expense were disregarded. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction was to call the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which might be an overreaction. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and the author didn't notice. When confronted, she was confused, indicating she didn't intend to cause harm. The argument might have escalated because the author's anger was out of proportion to the actual situation. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that taking some toppings was okay, but the girlfriend's action went beyond that. However, instead of addressing it calmly, the author reacted strongly. The girlfriend's defense that she didn't take all the cheese and that it's still eatable might be a valid point. \n\nIn relationships, small issues can become big if not communicated well. The author's anger over the pizza might be a symptom of deeper issues, like feeling disrespected, but the immediate cause was a specific action. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was harsh. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and starting a fight over what could have been discussed calmly. The girlfriend was wrong to take all the toppings, but the author's reaction was excessive. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
