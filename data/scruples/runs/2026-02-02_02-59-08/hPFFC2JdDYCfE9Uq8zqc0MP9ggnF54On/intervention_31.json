It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were ordering and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but would have some of whatever they get. \n\nThen, the author grabs two pieces, goes to watch TV, and the girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while. When he checks, he finds that she took toppings and chunks of cheese off all the pizza pieces. He got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The author is unsure if his reaction was justified.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend agreed to have some of whatever the author gets, which was a specific pizza they wanted. The author ordered it, expecting to share. The girlfriend then took toppings off every piece, not just a few. The author felt this was selfish and inconsiderate, hence the fight.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they paid for the pizza, wanted to share, and the girlfriend's actions destroyed the pizza they were expecting to enjoy. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was just taking a bit and didn't see the issue. \n\nBut is the author overreacting? Well, the key points are communication and expectations. The author mentioned they were \"starving\" and ordered the pizza. The girlfriend didn't specify she wanted to modify the entire order. Maybe the author didn't consider that she might have a different way of eating pizza, or that she thought it was okay since he took two pieces first. However, modifying the entire order in a way that makes it less enjoyable for the person who ordered it can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the author's reaction was a fight, calling her selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend was confused and thought it was fine. The question is whether the author's anger was disproportionate. While the action might be inconsiderate, arguing over how someone eats pizza might be a minor issue. Maybe the author should have discussed it calmly instead of escalating. \n\nBut the girlfriend's behavior was clearly altering the shared meal in a way that affects the author's enjoyment. If she didn't want a whole piece, maybe she could have asked for a different type or just taken some toppings from one piece. Taking from all the pieces could be seen as selfish. However, the argument might have been about the principle. \n\nI think the author's anger stems from feeling that the pizza was ruined for him. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and starting a big argument\u2014might be excessive. The wrong here is a bit split, but the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author ordered the pizza with the intention to share. The girlfriend didn't communicate her needs, but the author's response was harsh. Maybe the author should have handled it differently without a fight. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) for overreacting. But if the girlfriend was indeed being selfish by ruining the pizza for him, then B (author is not in the wrong). \n\nHowever, the key is how the situation was handled. The author's reaction might be the issue, even if the girlfriend was inconsiderate. So, the answer is A because the author started a fight over a minor issue. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were clearly wrong, then B. But since it's about how the argument started, the author's choice to escalate it into a fight might be the problem. \n\nBut the girlfriend was genuinely confused and the author's anger was over her modifying the pizza. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful of his preference. However, the argument itself was about the fight, so perhaps the author should have handled it better. \n\nHmm. The question is specifically about starting a fight. If the author's anger was justified but the way they reacted was inappropriate, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's actions were clearly selfish and the author was within their right to be upset, then not. \n\nI think the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction (calling her selfish, starting a big argument) might be the problem. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the author ordered the pizza, expecting to share. The girlfriend then took toppings off all pieces, making it less enjoyable. The author's anger is about the pizza being ruined. Maybe the author is right to be upset. So answer B. \n\nWait, the user's initial thought is A, but I need to decide. Considering that the girlfriend didn't communicate her need for toppings and modified the entire order without asking, the author's reaction is understandable. But starting a fight over it, even if justified, might be a problem. However, in the context of an AITA post, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely misplaced. However, the author's choice to escalate into a fight might be the issue. \n\nIt's a bit tricky. But the core of the problem is the girlfriend's behavior. The author had the right to be upset, but maybe the way they expressed it was wrong. So the answer is A. Alternatively, if the author's anger was justified, then B. \n\nI think the main point is that the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't entirely wrong. Therefore, the answer is B. But the author's reaction was a fight, so maybe A. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. So maybe the answer is A. But the girlfriend was modifying the pizza in a way that affected the author's meal. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the key is that the author ordered the pizza with the intention to share. The girlfriend's actions made it less enjoyable for him. The author's anger is about the selfishness, but the fight might have been unnecessary. However, the girlfriend's behavior was the main issue. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
