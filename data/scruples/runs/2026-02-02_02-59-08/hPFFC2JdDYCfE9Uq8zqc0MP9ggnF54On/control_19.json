It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong over a pizza situation. Let me break down the details to figure this out.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend ordered a pizza he specifically wanted from an expensive place. He asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. So he orders it. Then, he takes two pieces and goes to the living room. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, she says she's already eaten. He later finds out she took toppings and cheese off every piece, which he finds inconsiderate.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend said she was going to take some from his pizza, but didn't specify how. The boyfriend expected her to take maybe a few pieces or toppings off one or two. But she went overboard and stripped all the toppings from every piece. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nNow, who's at fault here? The boyfriend ordered the pizza because he was craving it and thought it was a special place. He was probably expecting to enjoy it with maybe a couple pieces, but instead, his girlfriend ruined the experience by eating all the toppings. But did he set clear expectations? When he asked if she wanted anything, he didn't specify that he wanted to eat the pizza himself, maybe without her taking anything. Maybe he should have communicated better that he wanted to share it in a way where it's fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since she said she'd have some of whatever he gets, taking toppings off all pieces was okay. But the problem is, she altered the pizza in a way that made it unenjoyable for him. He felt it was selfish. However, maybe she didn't realize how much he wanted it. The argument escalated into a bigger fight, which suggests poor communication on both sides.\n\nThe boyfriend's anger over the pizza might be seen as disproportionate. It's just a meal, after all. But if it's a special craving and the effort was made to get it, being upset is understandable. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but maybe she didn't mean to ruin the experience. The boyfriend called her selfish and acted like a child, which could be harsh, especially if he didn't set clear boundaries beforehand.\n\nSo, considering the situation, both might have some responsibility. The girlfriend should have considered how removing all toppings would affect his experience, and the boyfriend should have communicated his expectations better. But the question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. If he overreacted by calling her selfish and escalating the argument without addressing it calmly, that's on him. However, if her actions were genuinely selfish and he had a right to be upset, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't set clear expectations and reacted harshly, or B (not in the wrong) because she was inconsiderate. But given the details, maybe A is correct because both sides have some fault, but the main question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since he asked for her to take something but she went too far, and he escalated it unreasonably, he might share the blame.\n"
