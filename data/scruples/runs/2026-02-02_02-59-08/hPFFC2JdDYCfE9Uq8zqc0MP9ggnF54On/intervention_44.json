It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author was really craving pizza from a specific place, ordered it for themselves, and offered their girlfriend some. She declined initially but later took toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the girlfriend said she would eat some of whatever he got. When he ordered, she came back and he assumed she took toppings from just one or two. But she took from all pieces. He got upset, she was confused, and the argument escalated.\n\nNow, considering communication. The author didn't specify that he expected to have exclusive access to the pizza. He offered her some, but she declined. Then she took toppings, which he didn't expect. Maybe he should have clarified that he wanted to keep it for himself if she wasn't going to eat the whole pizza. But she took parts of it, which he found selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, she might have thought it was okay to take toppings since he had already taken his own pieces. She didn't take the whole pizza, just some toppings. Maybe she didn't realize how he values his pizza or the expense involved. But he didn't communicate his preferences clearly.\n\nHe called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. Yelling and name-calling are not constructive. The argument turned into a bigger fight, bringing up other issues. That's a red flag\u2014taking the argument beyond the immediate issue.\n\nThe key points are about communication and proportionality. The author didn't set clear expectations when ordering, leading to misunderstandings. His reaction was intense (calling her names, escalating the argument) over what might be seen as a minor issue. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from all pieces without consent could be seen as inconsiderate as well. \n\nBut the problem is whether the author is in the wrong. His initial request was to order for himself, which he had the right to do. However, after she took toppings from all slices, his reaction was disproportionate. The fact that he called her selfish and didn't handle it calmly makes him at fault. Arguments shouldn't involve name-calling and bringing up other issues. He should have expressed his frustration calmly instead of escalating.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his reaction was out of proportion and contributed to the argument's escalation.\n"
