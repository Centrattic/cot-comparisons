It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple arguing over pizza.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They mentioned it's a bit more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then the author took two pieces, ate them, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and came back without eating. The author then found out she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece of pizza. The author got angry, called her selfish, and argued with her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The author's perspective: they were looking forward to the pizza, ordered it, and the girlfriend took the toppings off all the pieces, which the author found selfish. They felt justified in getting angry because they had already eaten two pieces but were upset about the remaining pizza being ruined.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought she took toppings off a couple of pieces, but she actually took them off all. She might have felt that since the author had already eaten some, there was enough left for her to take what she wanted. She didn't take all the cheese, just some, and thought it was still edible. She also got defensive, saying the author was overreacting.\n\nNow, communication is key here. The author assumed the girlfriend meant she would take toppings off a few pieces, but she ended up modifying all of them. There might have been a miscommunication. Also, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish if she took more than she needed, but maybe she thought it was reasonable. The author's reaction was to call her selfish, which might be an overreaction if the girlfriend wasn't aware that it would affect the author's enjoyment of the remaining pizza. The argument escalated, bringing up other issues, which suggests there might be underlying tensions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author ordered the pizza specifically because they were craving it. The girlfriend agreed to share, but then modified the pizza in a way that ruined it for the author. Even if she had the right to take toppings, doing it to all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's initial request was to share, so maybe they should have considered that the girlfriend might need her own way of eating the pizza.\n\nBut the key point is that the author didn't check if the girlfriend had taken some before eating two pieces themselves. They might have assumed she would take a few, but she took all. The girlfriend might have misinterpreted the author's offer, thinking she could take toppings without affecting the author's portion. The author's anger might be justified if they expected to eat the remaining pizza as is, but if the girlfriend's actions made it unpalatable, then the author's reaction is understandable.\n\nHowever, calling someone selfish and blowing things out of proportion could be the author's fault. The argument turned into a bigger fight, possibly because of how the author reacted rather than the initial issue. Maybe the author should have discussed the pizza's condition with the girlfriend calmly instead of getting angry. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness might have been because she didn't see her actions as selfish, so the author's harsh words led to escalation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible that both parties contributed to the conflict. The author ordered the pizza and ate first without ensuring the girlfriend's needs were met, and the girlfriend took more than expected without communication. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's main issue was the girlfriend's inconsiderate action, then maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the way they reacted (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) could be seen as their fault. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the reaction could have been more measured. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just the reaction. If the girlfriend's action was indeed selfish, then the author isn't in the wrong for getting angry. The key is whether the action was selfish. If the girlfriend took all toppings, making the pizza less enjoyable for the author, then the author's anger is justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but perhaps with nuance. However, the system only allows A or B, so based on the analysis, the answer is B.\n"
