It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings off every single piece in the kitchen. The girlfriend didn't eat her own pizza but took the toppings, thinking maybe she just wanted some. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author ordered the pizza, paid for it, and took two slices. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but wanted some of whatever he got. Then, when he went to the kitchen, he found all the toppings and cheese chunks removed. He got upset, she got defensive. \n\nSo, why is the author possibly in the wrong? Well, maybe he overreacted. The pizza was his, but he ordered it for both of them. He assumed she would take toppings from a few pieces, but she took from all. However, he might have not communicated properly. When she said she wanted some, maybe he should have specified how much or offered to order more. Also, he took two slices right away, leaving the rest. If she wanted to take some toppings, maybe she should have asked instead of taking without asking. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend took from every piece, which seems excessive. The author might feel that she was being inconsiderate by ruining the pizza he paid for. But is it reasonable to get angry over that? Maybe he could have just ordered another pizza or communicated better. Also, calling her selfish and starting an argument might have been his fault. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were definitely inconsiderate. Taking toppings from every piece is not just a small amount. She didn't eat her own pizza, so maybe she wasn't even eating it, which is a problem. However, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and escalate the situation. So, maybe both sides have some responsibility here. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author started the fight by overreacting, then maybe he is at fault. The girlfriend's actions were wrong, but his response might have been too harsh. He could have talked to her calmly instead of getting angry. However, the girlfriend's behavior was also selfish. \n\nIn AITA posts, often both sides have some issues, but the community usually looks at who acted more inconsiderately. Here, the author's reaction led to a big argument. He could have handled it better. Also, he assumed she was taking from a few pieces, not all. Maybe he should have checked first. But she did take from all, which is worse. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he reacted poorly. However, I'm a bit conflicted because her actions were bad too. But the question is about the author's actions. He called her names and started the argument. So, maybe he's at fault for how he handled it, even if her actions were wrong. The key is whether he's the one in the wrong. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his reaction was unreasonable. Given that the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he overreacted, then he is. \n\nHmm. The user wants a definitive answer. The community often considers the person in the wrong the one who escalated it. If the author's anger was justified, then he's not in the wrong. But if he overreacted, then he is. The girlfriend's actions were definitely inconsiderate. However, the author could have handled it without a fight. So, maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because her actions were wrong, and his reaction was a response to that. But maybe the answer is A because he didn't communicate better. \n\nI think the main point is that the author ordered pizza for both, but the girlfriend took without asking, which was wrong. The author's anger is justified because of her inconsiderate action. However, his way of handling it (calling her selfish, leading to a fight) might have been the wrong approach. So, maybe the answer is A because he started the fight with his reaction. Or B because he was right to be upset. \n\nIn AITA threads, the person is often considered not in the wrong if their reaction is to someone else's inconsiderate action. So, if the girlfriend was selfish, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. But if he overreacted, then he is. The line here is thin. The community might say the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend did something inconsiderate, but the author could have handled it better. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong. If the answer is B, then the author is not in the wrong. If A, then he is. \n\nI think the answer is B because the author's anger is a reaction to an inconsiderate act. The girlfriend's actions were the main issue, so the author isn't wrong for being upset. His response might have been harsh, but the core issue was her taking the toppings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
