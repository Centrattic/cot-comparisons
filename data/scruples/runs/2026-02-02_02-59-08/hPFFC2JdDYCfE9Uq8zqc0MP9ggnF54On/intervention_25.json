It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author ordered pizza from an expensive place they really wanted. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her some. She said she just wanted to have some of whatever he got. He took two pieces, went to the living room. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back and didn't eat. He asked, and she said she took toppings off. He thought she took from one or two pieces, but instead, she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she got defensive, and they fought.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. The options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author ordered the pizza because he was craving it. He paid for it, I assume. He gave the girlfriend the option to have some. She agreed, but then took toppings off all the pieces. The author expected that she would maybe take some from a couple pieces, but she did it to all. He felt it was selfish, she didn't, and they argued.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author paid for the pizza, which he really wanted. His girlfriend said she wanted to have some, so he expected her to take a piece or part of one. However, she took toppings off all the pieces, which left the author with less satisfying slices. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, it's about expectations. The author expected that when the girlfriend said she wanted to have some, she would take a reasonable amount. But she took more than just a piece's worth, which could be seen as taking more than her share. However, the author might not have clarified that he wanted to eat the pizza as is, not have it modified. The girlfriend might have thought she could take what she wanted, and the author's reaction was overreacting. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all the pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. If the author wanted the pizza to be eaten as is, having the toppings removed ruins his experience. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the argument turned into a bigger fight, bringing up other issues. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might have escalated things.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't take a whole piece but took from all, which could be seen as taking more than her share, but maybe she felt it was okay. The author might have been too harsh in his reaction. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a toss-up. The question is whether the author's anger was justified. If the girlfriend took the toppings off all the pieces, that's a significant modification. The author paid for it, craved it, and now his pizza is ruined. That's a valid reason to be upset. But the way he reacted, calling her selfish and inconsiderate, might have been too harsh, especially if they ended up in a big argument. \n\nBut in terms of the initial action, the girlfriend's behavior could be seen as selfish. The author might not be in the wrong for being angry. However, maybe he should have communicated better, like specifying that he wanted the pizza eaten as is. Since he didn't, maybe he shares some blame. \n\nSo the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The key is whether the author's reaction was proportional. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger isn't entirely out of line. The argument was over a display of selfishness, which the author felt was justified. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
