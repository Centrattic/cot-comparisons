It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The author's girlfriend took toppings from all the pizza pieces, not just a few, and the author got angry, calling her selfish. The girlfriend was confused and thought the author had already eaten his share.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza specifically because they were craving it, and they asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said she'd have some of whatever he ordered. Then, when he ate his two pieces, he expected there to be pizza left for her to take toppings from, but she took from all pieces, leaving none for the author's subsequent requests. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have assumed that after he ate his share, the rest was for her, but she took from all pieces, possibly without understanding that he might want more later. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she knew he would want to eat more later. However, she might not have realized that he expected leftovers. Did the author clearly communicate that he would want more? He ordered the pizza for himself but asked her if she wanted something, so maybe he expected her to take some, but not all. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and get into a big argument. Is that an overreaction? Maybe. The girlfriend was confused, which suggests that she didn't intend to be selfish. The author might be taking it too personally, especially over something trivial like pizza. On the other hand, if she took all the toppings, that could make the pizza inedible for him later, so there's a valid reason for frustration. \n\nBut considering that it's just pizza and the argument escalated, perhaps the author's reaction was disproportionate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was aggressive. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if both parties have some responsibility. \n\nThe author didn't specify that he wanted leftovers or that he would eat more. Maybe he should have communicated better. The girlfriend took the toppings without considering he might want more. So perhaps both sides have some fault. However, the author's response was more intense. In terms of who is in the wrong for starting the fight, the author initiated the conflict by getting angry and calling her names. The girlfriend's confusion might not be malicious, so the author's reaction was the first aggressive move. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n"
