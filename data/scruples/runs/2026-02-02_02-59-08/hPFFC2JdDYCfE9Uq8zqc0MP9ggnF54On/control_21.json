It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering expensive pizza they were craving, the girlfriend agreeing to have some of whatever they get. The author eats two pieces, then later finds that the girlfriend has taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. They argue about it, with the author feeling wronged and the girlfriend thinking the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they paid for the pizza, were looking forward to it, and the girlfriend took what they consider to be an inconsiderate action. The girlfriend's side: she wanted some toppings but not the whole pizza, so she took what she wanted from the remaining pieces. She didn't take the entire pizza, just parts off each piece, leaving it still edible.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe. The key points are communication and expectations. The author assumed the girlfriend would take toppings off one or two pieces, but she did it to every piece. The author didn't check on the pizza after ordering, and when they did, they reacted strongly. The girlfriend might have thought she was being helpful by taking what she wanted, but didn't consider the author's feelings about the remaining pizza being ruined. However, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating to a big argument might be over the top. The argument includes bringing up other issues, which isn't helpful. The girlfriend's confusion and defense suggest she didn't see her actions as wrong. \n\nThe author's anger over the pizza being modified in a way they didn't expect could be a valid feeling, but the way they reacted might be the bigger issue. The question is whether the author's anger was proportionate. Since it's just pizza and not a major issue, their reaction might be seen as excessive. On the other hand, the girlfriend's action of altering all the pieces without considering the author's preferences could be inconsiderate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who escalates the conflict is more at fault. The author called the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which might have sparked her defensive response. The argument spiraled into other issues, which the author could have avoided. The author might have handled it better by discussing the situation calmly instead of lashing out. The girlfriend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate, but the author's response in terms of communication led to the fight. So, while both have some fault, the author's escalation makes them more at fault here. Answer A.\n"
