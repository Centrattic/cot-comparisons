It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place they were craving, which was more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said no but would have some of what he gets. Then he orders, eats two pieces, and goes to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, then comes back without eating. He asks, and she says she took toppings off the pizza, but when he checks, she's removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, she says he's being a child. They argue more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and had a specific craving. They might have expected that the pizza would be for both of them, but since the girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything, maybe the author thought he was getting it for himself. However, when he asked her if she wanted something, she said no but would have some of what he got. So maybe she expected that she could eat part of his order without him having to order a separate one. But when she took toppings off all the pieces, that might have been a problem because he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. \n\nThe girlfriend's action of removing toppings from every piece could be seen as inconsiderate because she altered the pizza he ordered without considering his preference. However, he did order the pizza with the understanding that she might eat some of it. But she didn't take any whole slices, just the toppings. That might be a boundary issue. The author's reaction is anger and calling her selfish, while she says he's overreacting. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, maybe he should have considered that she might not like the pizza he ordered even if he asked beforehand. But she didn't specify her preferences. Alternatively, maybe she should have communicated better that she wanted to modify the pizza instead of just taking toppings. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed she didn't care about the pizza when she said she didn't want anything, leading to confusion. However, altering the food someone else ordered without discussing it could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating to a big argument could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nThe main question is whether the author's anger is justified. If the girlfriend took toppings from all the pieces, making them not edible as the author wanted, then his anger is about a shared resource being altered without consent. But if the pizza was his to begin with, even though he offered for her to have some, then maybe she overstepped by taking so much. \n\nI think the key here is that the author ordered the pizza for himself but allowed the girlfriend to partake. The girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces without his consent was a problem. The author's anger might be justified because his food was altered in a way that made it less enjoyable for him. However, the way he reacted by calling her selfish and escalating the argument could be seen as his fault. So maybe the answer is a mix, but the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since the core issue was her taking without considering his preferences, the author might not be in the wrong. But perhaps he could have handled it better without yelling. However, the initial action of altering the pizza is her fault. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
