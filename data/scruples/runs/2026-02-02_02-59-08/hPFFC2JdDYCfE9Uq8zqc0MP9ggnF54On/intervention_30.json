It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over the pizza incident. The situation involves the author ordering a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. When he got the pizza, he ate two slices, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and when he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clearly excited about the pizza he craved and paid extra for. He invited the girlfriend to have some, expecting maybe a couple of slices or some toppings. However, the girlfriend took a lot from all the pieces, leaving them barely edible. The author's reaction was anger and frustration, which led to a fight.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by not taking whole slices, but in her way, taking what she wanted without realizing the impact. She might not have considered that the author was paying for the pizza and had a specific craving. Her confusion about his anger suggests a communication gap.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that the case? The author did order the pizza for himself, but he did offer the girlfriend some. The issue is how she took it. If she took the majority of the toppings, making the remaining pizza not worth eating, then the author's frustration is understandable. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have been harsh. Maybe he should have discussed it calmly instead of escalating.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? The problem is the girlfriend's actions. She took without considering the author's needs. However, the author initiated the fight, which is the key point. Even if he felt wronged, starting a big argument over this might be disproportionate. The question is whether his reaction was justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of being confused and defensive might indicate she didn't realize the harm. The author's anger might be valid, but the way he handled it could be at fault. Maybe he should have talked to her first before getting angry. However, the act of taking all the toppings could be seen as selfish, especially if they were sharing the expense. Wait, the author paid for it. The girlfriend didn't contribute. So maybe she had no right to take so much. The author's frustration is over someone else taking his stuff without considering his needs. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been too harsh. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. Since the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful, the author's anger isn't entirely his fault. But he did escalate the situation. It's a bit of a grey area. If the author's anger was disproportionate, then he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were clearly selfish, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nThe key points are: He paid for the pizza, she took without considering him, he got angry. The problem is whether his anger was justified. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been over the top. However, given that it's a shared space and he had already eaten, maybe the girlfriend should have asked. \n\nIn the end, the author's anger is understandable, but the way he handled it might not be. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer would likely be No (B) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's anger, while it led to a fight, was a reaction to her actions. So the main wrong is on her side. Hence, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
