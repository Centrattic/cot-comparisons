It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and then found out their girlfriend took toppings off all the remaining slices. They got angry, called her selfish, and a big argument happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear they were starving and ordered the pizza, offering the girlfriend to get something. The girlfriend said she'd have some of what the author got. Then, the author ate two slices, assuming the rest was for her. But when he went to the kitchen, he found she took toppings off every piece. He got angry, thinking she was being inconsiderate. She didn't take all, just some, and thought it was still okay. She was confused why he was upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overreacted. Maybe the girlfriend didn't communicate she wanted toppings off, leading to a misunderstanding. The author assumed she just wanted a little, but she took from all slices. However, the author also ordered the pizza for both, so maybe expected her to leave some for him. But the girlfriend might not have realized that by removing toppings, she was affecting the author's enjoyment. On the other hand, the author could have checked the remaining pizza before eating, or communicated better. \n\nThe key points: Did the author have a right to be upset about the toppings being removed? The girlfriend might not have considered the author's preference. However, the author could have been more understanding. The argument escalated quickly. The author called her selfish, which might be a harsh reaction. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't realize the issue. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The author might have overreacted by calling her selfish, but the girlfriend could have been more considerate. However, the author's anger seems out of proportion for just pizza. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit torn. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But maybe both have some fault. But the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. Since the author started the fight by calling her names and being inconsiderate, leading to the argument, maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish. Hmm. But the answer options are A or B. Considering the situation, maybe the author overreacted, so A. But some might say B. I need to decide based on typical AITA scenarios. Usually, if someone gets angry over a minor thing, they're at fault. But here, the action of taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's response might have been excessive. So perhaps A is correct. I think the answer is A.\n"
