It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is a bit pricier but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then the author ordered the pizza, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time, and when she came back, the author noticed she wasn't eating. She said she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that when the girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever pizza they got, it meant she wanted to eat some of the pizza as it was. But she ended up modifying all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. The girlfriend thought it was fine because she took only some toppings and didn't take all the cheese off each piece.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were expecting their girlfriend to share the pizza as is, and her actions of taking toppings off every piece made the pizza less enjoyable for them. The author felt that this was selfish because they had already eaten two pieces, but the girlfriend's modification affected the rest of the pizza. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole piece and was confused about why the author was upset.\n\nI need to consider if the author overreacted. The argument was about how the girlfriend handled the pizza leftovers. The author was angry because their girlfriend altered the pizza in a way that made it less appealing to them. The girlfriend didn't realize how her actions affected the author's enjoyment. \n\nIt's possible that the author didn't communicate their expectations clearly. When the author offered pizza, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take toppings off the remaining pieces. However, the author might have expected the pizza to stay intact for them to eat the rest. The girlfriend's action of modifying every piece could be seen as selfish if it ruined the pizza for the author. \n\nBut on the other hand, the girlfriend might not have thought about how removing toppings from all pieces would affect the author. If the author had specified that they wanted the pizza to stay as it was, maybe the girlfriend wouldn't have done that. The argument could have been avoided with clearer communication.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author got angry over the girlfriend's actions, which the girlfriend didn't see as a problem. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument. The girlfriend's response was defensive, saying the author was overreacting. \n\nIt seems like both parties could be at fault. The author didn't clarify their expectations, and the girlfriend didn't consider how her actions would affect the author. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author initiated the fight by getting angry and calling the girlfriend selfish, maybe they are at fault. But if the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, then the author isn't wrong. \n\nIt's a bit of a judgment call. The author's reaction was intense, but if they felt their expectations were reasonable, maybe not wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal boundaries. However, since the girlfriend had already taken toppings off every piece, which could be seen as selfish, the author's anger might be justified. But the argument could have been avoided with better communication from both sides. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they felt disrespected, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A for yes and B for no. Given the situation described, the author's reaction is understandable, so the answer might be B (not wrong).\n"
