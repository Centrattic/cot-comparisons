It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza for themselves and asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. So he ordered, ate two pieces, and then went back to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off some pieces. But when he checked, he found that she had removed toppings and chunks of cheese from every single piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had an argument.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The key here is understanding both perspectives. The author felt that the girlfriend was being inconsiderate by altering the pizza he ordered without asking, especially since he had already eaten some. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have felt that since he had already gotten his pieces, she was just taking what she wanted from the remaining pizza. She might not have realized the extent of the damage he found, perhaps thinking she was only taking a little from a couple of pieces.\n\nNow, the author's anger stemmed from the girlfriend's actions, which he perceived as selfish. But was it reasonable? The girlfriend didn't ask for the pizza but ended up eating from it. However, the author didn't specify that she wasn't allowed to touch it. He assumed she would take toppings off a couple of pieces, but she did it to all. The argument escalated when the author called her names, which might be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's response of being \"annoying\" could be a valid reaction to the author's harsh words.\n\nSo, considering both sides: while the girlfriend's actions might not be the best, the author's reaction might be more intense than necessary. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author took the first action by getting angry and calling her selfish, leading to the argument, that could place the blame on him. However, if the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nBut in relationships, how we handle disagreements matters. The author's response might be seen as disproportionate. The girlfriend had a different expectation, and instead of addressing it calmly, he escalated it. So, the author might be in the wrong for the way he reacted, even if the initial situation was frustrating. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
