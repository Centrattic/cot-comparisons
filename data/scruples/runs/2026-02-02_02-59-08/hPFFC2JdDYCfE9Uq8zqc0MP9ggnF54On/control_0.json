It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza they really wanted, and their girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, then went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, and when he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author ordered the pizza specifically, maybe even paid for it, and was looking forward to eating it. When he ordered, he might have expected that the pizza would be there for him to eat as he wanted. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have felt that since he had already taken some pieces, she could modify the remaining ones however she liked. But taking toppings off every piece seems a bit extreme, especially if she didn't ask first. \n\nHe asked her if she wanted something, and she said no, so maybe he thought she wasn't going to take any. But then she took some, modified all the pieces, which was unexpected. The author's frustration could be because of the effort she put into altering the pizza without consulting him, which might feel inconsiderate. However, maybe she didn't realize how much he wanted the pizza or that he expected to eat all the pieces. \n\nBut then again, if she's his girlfriend, maybe she assumed that sharing the pizza was part of their dynamic. However, taking toppings off every piece is quite a lot. It's not just taking one or two, but modifying all of them, which could make the pizza less enjoyable for him. \n\nHe called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a strong reaction, but maybe justified given the situation. She was confused and thought he was overreacting. The argument escalated, which is unfortunate because it's just about pizza. But if the act of modifying the pizza without communication was a dealbreaker for him, maybe his reaction is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered that she might want to eat some but with modifications, and perhaps he could have ordered extra or discussed preferences beforehand. But she did say she would have some of whatever he got, so maybe she didn't realize he wanted it all. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate but maybe not malicious. The author's anger might be a bit harsh, but if the pizza was a big deal to him, it's a valid reaction. However, calling someone selfish and inconsiderate can come off as accusatory. Maybe the author should have communicated his feelings better instead of escalating to arguments. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend didn't ask for the pizza and then modified it without consent, she might be at fault. However, the author could have anticipated that she might want to modify it, so maybe he's also responsible for not ordering separate pizzas. \n\nI think the key points are: he asked if she wanted something, she said no, he ordered, she modified all the pieces without asking. His reaction is based on her not considering his preference. But she might not have realized the extent of his desire for the pizza. The author's anger is about the selfishness of not considering his wants, but maybe he should have ordered extra. However, the girlfriend's action was definitely inconsiderate. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
