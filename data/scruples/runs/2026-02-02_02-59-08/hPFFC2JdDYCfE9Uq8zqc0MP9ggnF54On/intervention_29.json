It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza between a guy and his girlfriend. The guy ordered pizza he wanted, even though it was a bit expensive, and offered her some. She said she'd have some, but then ended up taking toppings off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy was really craving this specific pizza, which was more expensive. He ordered it and offered her a share. She said she'd eat some. He ate two pieces, then went back to watch TV. When he went to the kitchen later, he found she had removed toppings off all the pieces. He was upset, called her selfish, and she called him childish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI think about what each person did. The guy had already eaten two pieces, but maybe he expected her to just take a few toppings off a couple of slices if she wanted some. But she took from all the pieces. That might be an issue because he paid for the pizza, and she altered it without his consent. However, he did order it for himself and maybe they had an unspoken agreement that the pizza was his unless she wanted a whole slice. But she said she'd have some, not a whole slice. So maybe she thought it was okay to take parts without eating the whole slice.\n\nOn the other hand, he might have assumed that by saying she wanted some, she meant a whole piece. He ordered expensive pizza, maybe expecting to have it his way. She modified it in a way that affected his enjoyment. But was it selfish? If she took a bit from each, maybe it's a different scenario than taking all the toppings. The guy's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which might be a bit harsh if she meant to share but ended up overdoing it. But if he paid for it and she changed it without asking, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, communication is key here. Maybe he should have clarified if she wanted a whole piece or just toppings. She might have thought taking a little from each was okay, but he didn't expect that. The argument escalated because of misunderstandings. So, who's at fault?\n\nThe guy could be in the wrong if he didn't clearly communicate his expectations. However, she modified the pizza without his consent, which is also an issue. It's a bit of a toss-up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe both have points. But since the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong, I need to decide if his anger was justified. If he paid for the pizza and she altered it without consent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he didn't consider her needs and didn't set clear boundaries, maybe he is. Hmm.\n\nI think the key points are: he ordered it, offered her some, she took without asking, altered all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish. She thought it was okay. The problem is mutual misunderstanding. The guy might have been wrong to call her selfish without discussing first, but she did alter the pizza. However, since he paid for it and she changed it without asking, maybe he's not wrong. But his reaction could be seen as over the top. So maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he escalated it without understanding her actions properly, or B (no, he's not) because she did mess with his pizza. I'm leaning towards A because the initial anger and calling her names might be overreacting given the situation wasn't that big. But maybe B because she did do something that affected him. It's tricky.\n"
