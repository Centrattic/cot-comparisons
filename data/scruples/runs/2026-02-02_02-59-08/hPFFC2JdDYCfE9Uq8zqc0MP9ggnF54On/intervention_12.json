It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author ordered pizza from a specific place he wanted, asked his girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of what he gets. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to watch TV. His girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, came back, and didn't eat. When he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, she said he was overreacting.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author wanted pizza he was craving, and his girlfriend said she'd have some of it. He ordered it, assuming she would take a piece. However, she didn't take a whole piece but took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt this was selfish because he thought she wanted a piece but didn't take one, instead modifying all the pizza. He got upset and started an argument.\n\nFrom his perspective, he had ordered the pizza intending to share, and her actions made the pizza less enjoyable for him. She, on the other hand, might have thought she could take whatever she wanted since he had already eaten two pieces and the pizza was there. She might also have thought that taking toppings off was a way to have some without taking a whole piece, maybe due to dietary reasons or preference. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger stems from feeling that she was inconsiderate. But maybe he didn't consider that she might have different preferences. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece, so maybe she's vegetarian, or she has a food allergy, or just doesn't like some toppings. The author ordered pizza for himself, but maybe he should have considered that she might not want a whole slice but still wanted to participate in eating it. However, she didn't communicate that clearly. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which led to an argument. The argument might have been avoidable if he had discussed his feelings more calmly. The author's reaction might be disproportionate if the toppings aren't a big deal. However, if he paid for the pizza and expected to share it, her taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as taking more than her share in an inconsiderate way. \n\nBut the girlfriend also didn't take a whole slice, so maybe she intended to take some from each piece. The author might have assumed she wanted a whole slice but she didn't. The communication breakdown here is significant. The author didn't clarify when he ordered, and she didn't explain her actions. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might be overreacting because it's just pizza, and she didn't take all his pizza. She took some toppings, but he still had the rest. However, if he specifically wanted the toppings and paid for the pizza, her actions could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut maybe the author is wrong because he didn't consider her preferences beforehand. He ordered pizza he wanted, but perhaps he should have ordered two different pizzas if he knew she might not want the same toppings. Alternatively, if she knew he wanted the toppings, maybe she should have communicated better. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's anger was justified. Since the girlfriend didn't take a whole slice and modified the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, escalating to an argument over this might be his fault for overreacting. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because he had a right to be upset about his pizza being altered in a way he didn't agree with. But some might argue that he should have communicated better. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't wrong for feeling that way. Therefore, I think the answer is B.\n"
