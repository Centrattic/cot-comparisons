It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, let me break down the scenario. The person ordered pizza they really wanted, and their girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever they got. He ate two pieces, then went to the living room. She was in the kitchen a while, and when he went to get more, she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo the question is whether he's wrong for getting angry. The key points here are communication and expectations. When he ordered the pizza, he asked her if she wanted anything, and she said no but would have some. He might have assumed she would take a piece or two, but she ended up modifying all the pieces. \n\nBut was his reaction justified? Well, she did say she only wanted some of the toppings, not the whole piece. He thought that meant taking toppings off a couple, but she did all of them. That's a miscommunication. She might have had the right to take what she wanted, especially since he said she could have some. However, by taking from all the pieces, she made them less enjoyable for him, which he felt was selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, he did order the pizza for himself, so maybe he should have considered that others might want to eat it too. But he did ask her if she wanted something, and she declined. Then she changed her mind and took from all the pieces. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior could be seen as inconsiderate because she didn't leave any unmodified pizza for him. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and being angry over it might have escalated the situation. The argument could have been avoided if they had communicated better. However, the girlfriend's actions did affect his enjoyment of the pizza he paid for, which he craved all day. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author might have overreacted by calling her selfish and getting into a big argument, but the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (No) because the situation involved both parties' miscommunication and actions. The author's anger isn't entirely unjustified given the effort and cost, but his response might have been too harsh. However, the main fault isn't entirely on him. So I think the answer is B.\n"
