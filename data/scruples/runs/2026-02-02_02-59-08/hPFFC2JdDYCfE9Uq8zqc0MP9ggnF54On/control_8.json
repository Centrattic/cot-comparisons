It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.

My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza with their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author wanted pizza from a specific place and ordered it. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ate two pieces, then when he went to the kitchen, he found she had taken toppings off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said no, would have some of his pizza. So he ordered it expecting she'd take some. She didn't take a whole piece but took toppings off all the pieces. That's the issue. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think. Did he own the pizza? He ordered it, paid for it, so maybe he considered it his. But he had already eaten two pieces. The remaining pizza was left, and the girlfriend took toppings off. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might have thought that since he had already eaten, the remaining pizza was available for her to use as she wanted. The author expected her to take a portion or maybe a piece, but she took toppings off all pieces, which he found inconsiderate. \n\nBut here's the thing: when someone orders food, especially when sharing, there are unspoken agreements. If she said she would have some, maybe he should have clarified whether she wanted a piece or just some toppings. The author might have assumed she would take a piece, but she took a different approach. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's action of removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as taking without considering his remaining portions. The author's anger might be over a display of selfishness, as he claims. \n\nBut the girlfriend might not have realized how much the author valued the pizza, especially since he mentioned it was a specific place he craved. Maybe she didn't think about how he would feel after eating two slices. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the pizza wasn't eaten; it was just altered. She didn't take all the toppings. He might be seeing it as a personal affront, but maybe she didn't mean to be inconsiderate. \n\nThe argument escalated because of communication issues. The author might have been assuming she would take a piece, but she took toppings off all. The girlfriend might have felt she was allowed to use the remaining pizza as she wanted since he had already eaten. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author could have been more communicative about his expectations. On the other hand, the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether his reaction was proportionate. Since the girlfriend didn't take the entire pizza, just modified it, maybe the author overreacted. But if he was expecting her to take a piece and she didn't, that's a miscommunication. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's confusion about why he was angry suggests she didn't see it as selfish. The author's anger might be justified if he felt she was taking more than her share without considering his remaining pizza. \n\nBut considering that the pizza was a shared order (since she was supposed to have some), removing toppings from all pieces makes it less enjoyable for both. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong in being upset. \n\nHowever, the argument started because of a lack of communication. The author could have clarified his expectations when he ordered the pizza. The girlfriend might have thought she could have leftovers as she saw fit. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the answer is probably not the author entirely. The situation is a misunderstanding. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion might be the issue. \n\nThe key is whether the anger was justified. If the pizza was for both, and she modified it in a way that affected his remaining portions, then maybe he's not wrong. But if she just took some toppings and the pizza was still edible, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nOverall, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong, so B.\n"
