It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. They provided a detailed scenario where the girlfriend ended up eating most of the pizza by taking toppings off every piece. The author got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and asked if the girlfriend wanted something. She said no but then took toppings off every piece. That seems like she didn't communicate her needs and ended up taking a lot without considering the author's order. However, the author didn't check if she had any before eating their own pieces. Maybe they should have considered that she might not have wanted any after all but didn't take any.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend took a lot of the pizza without asking, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's frustration might stem from not only the pizza being taken but also the lack of communication. But the initial request was clear: she said she would have some of what he got. Taking toppings off every piece might be excessive, which the author points out. \n\nHowever, the author did start eating their own pizza first. If they had shared or offered her some, maybe the situation would have been different. The fact that she took from all the pieces without talking about it could be selfish, but the author's reaction of calling her selfish and childishly blowing things out of proportion might have escalated the argument unnecessarily. \n\nIt's possible that the author's anger was justified if they were starving and then had their pizza significantly altered without consent. But maybe they could have approached it with more calmness. The girlfriend's confusion and defensiveness also play a role. The key points are communication and expectations. The author might have been in the right to express their frustration, but the way they handled it (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) was harsh. Alternatively, the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, making the author's anger understandable. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. The fact that the girlfriend took toppings from every piece without asking is a problem, but the author didn't check if she had any. Maybe they could have shared better. But the author's initial request was met with a \"no,\" so expecting her to take toppings off without communication is a breach. \n\nIn the end, the author's anger might be justified given the situation, but their approach could have been better. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's actions. So, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend took without asking, the author isn't entirely at fault. But if the author didn't offer any, maybe they share some responsibility. The answer hinges on whether the author overreacted. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
