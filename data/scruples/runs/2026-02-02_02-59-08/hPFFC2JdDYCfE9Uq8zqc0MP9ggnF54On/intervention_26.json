It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two slices, and then found out his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because he was craving it, even though it's expensive. He asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two slices, and when he went to the kitchen, he found she had removed toppings and cheese from all the pieces. He got upset because he thought she took toppings off a couple, not all. She, on the other hand, thought it was fine since he had his own slices and she just wanted some toppings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that she would take a reasonable amount, maybe off one or two slices, but she went to the extent of every piece. The girlfriend might not have realized the significance of the pizza to him, especially since it's a more expensive place. However, she might have thought that since he ordered it, she could take what she wanted from the remaining slices. There's a breakdown in communication here. The author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the toppings on all slices, and she didn't clarify her intentions. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that her actions were inconsiderate because he had a craving and paid for the pizza. But from her side, she might feel that she was just taking what she wanted from the food that was there. The argument escalated because neither party communicated their needs clearly. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be an overreaction given that it's just pizza. However, if the pizza was a big deal to him, maybe his feelings are valid. But the argument started because of a miscommunication rather than malicious intent. So, both parties might share some responsibility. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the author could be at fault for not setting clear expectations when he ordered the pizza. He didn't specify how he wanted the pizza prepared, so she had no reason to believe he wouldn't let her take toppings. On the other hand, she could be in the wrong for not asking before taking so much from the pizza, especially if she knew it was important to him. But the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The author did ask if she wanted anything, and she said no. He assumed she'd take some toppings, but she took more than he expected. However, he didn't specify his preference, so maybe he's not entirely wrong. Alternatively, his reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate without discussing it calmly might have been the catalyst for the fight. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for overreacting and not communicating his needs better. \n\nBut then again, if she went through all the effort to remove toppings from every slice, that's a bit excessive. Maybe he has a point, but his approach was poor. The problem is whether the anger was justified. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. He might have been justified in feeling upset, but his approach led to a fight. \n\nIn conclusion, both sides have some fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering that the author could have communicated his preferences better and reacted more calmly, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, there's a balance because the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. But given that the argument started with the author's anger and accusations, the author might be more at fault here. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
