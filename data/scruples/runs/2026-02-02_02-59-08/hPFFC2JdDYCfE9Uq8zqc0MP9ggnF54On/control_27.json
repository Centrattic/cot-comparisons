It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered pizza from an expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, but would have some of what he gets. He orders, eats two pieces, then realizes she's been in the kitchen. When he checks, he finds she's removed toppings and cheese from every pizza piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza he ordered. He might have assumed that meant she would take a piece or two, but instead she took from all pieces. Did she communicate her intention? She said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought that meant taking from one or two pieces, but she took from every piece. That's a key miscommunication.\n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling disrespected or taken advantage of. The girlfriend didn't take a whole piece but modified all the pizza, which the author found inconsiderate. The girlfriend was confused and thought it wasn't a big deal. The argument escalated when the author called her selfish, leading to name-calling and bringing up past issues.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors are: Did the girlfriend overstep by taking from all the pizza? Did the author overreact? The girlfriend might not have considered that the author values his specific pizza order, maybe he wanted it a certain way. However, she did ask to have some, and modifying all the pieces could make the pizza less enjoyable for him. But she didn't take the whole pizza, just parts. The author could have ordered extra or specified if he wanted the pizza untouched. However, the girlfriend didn't ask for permission before altering it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and bring up past arguments, which is a common escalation tactic. Arguing over this might have been unnecessary since it's just pizza. But the author's frustration is valid if he felt his needs weren't respected. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response was more confrontational. The initial problem is mutual misunderstanding. The girlfriend didn't clarify her actions, and the author didn't consider that she might need to take some. But since the author is the one who ordered the pizza, he might have had a right to expect it to be eaten as ordered. However, the way he reacted by calling her names and escalating the argument is likely the bigger issue here. So, maybe the author is partly in the wrong for overreacting. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were really inconsiderate, then maybe not. But given that it's a partner situation, communication is key. The author's anger might be justified, but his response was harsh. Hence, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he overreacted and escalated the situation, even if the initial issue was a misunderstanding.\n"
