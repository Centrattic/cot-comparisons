It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza and asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything. She said no, but then took toppings and cheese off all the pieces when they were in the kitchen. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear they wanted pizza and even offered their girlfriend some, which she initially declined. When she later took parts from all the pieces, the author felt this was inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought that since the author had already taken two pieces, taking from the remaining ones wasn't a big deal. She might have felt she was just using the food available, not taking entire pieces.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author ordered the pizza expecting to share it, as the girlfriend initially said she would have some of whatever he got. However, she changed her mind later and took from all the pieces, which the author saw as taking without asking. The girlfriend might have felt it was okay because she was using the leftovers, but maybe didn't realize it was a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction was to get angry and call her selfish. While it's understandable to be upset about someone taking from shared food without asking, the question is whether the anger was justified. The girlfriend was confused and didn't see the issue, which suggests there might have been a miscommunication. The author could have approached it calmly, asked why she did that, and expressed their feelings without yelling. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from all the pizza pieces might be seen as selfish, especially if the author had already taken theirs and expected the rest to be shared.\n\nBut I also have to think about the other side. The girlfriend didn't take entire pieces, just toppings and cheese. Maybe she thought it was a way to make the pizza last longer or use it as she wanted. If the author wanted to keep the pizza for himself or expected her to not touch it, he might have needed to communicate that better. The fact that he didn't specify that she couldn't touch any of the pizza could be part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have assumed that because she initially said no, she wouldn't take from it later. The girlfriend might have thought she could use the pizza as she pleased after he took his share. The argument might have been preventable if they had discussed their expectations beforehand. However, the author's response of calling her selfish and acting like a child might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives: the author's anger might be justified if he felt the pizza was shared and she took without asking. However, his reaction was harsh. The girlfriend might have been inconsiderate by not asking, but she might not have realized the issue. The author could have handled it more calmly. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was using the pizza without asking, that's inconsiderate. But the author didn't set boundaries first. Maybe the wrong is on both sides, but the question is binary. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nThe key is that the author ordered the pizza, offered to share, and the girlfriend took from it without asking. The author's anger is over her taking without permission. The wrong here might be on the girlfriend for taking without asking. However, the author could have been clearer. But since the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and didn't communicate her intentions, maybe she thought it was okay. The author's reaction might be a bit over the top, but the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. So perhaps both did something wrong. But since the question is about the author, I need to see if he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the author didn't specify that the pizza was for him and that he didn't want her to take from it, maybe he's partially responsible. But he did offer her some, and she said no. Then later took from it. The author's anger is understandable, but his approach of yelling and calling her selfish might be where he's wrong. He should have communicated his feelings better. So maybe the author is in the wrong for the way he reacted, even if the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
