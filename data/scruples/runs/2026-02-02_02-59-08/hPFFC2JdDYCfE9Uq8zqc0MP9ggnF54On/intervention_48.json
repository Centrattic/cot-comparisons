It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and their girlfriend. The author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They offered the girlfriend some, and she said she would have some of whatever pizza he gets. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while and came back without eating. When he asked why, she said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought she took toppings off a few pieces, but found out she had taken toppings off all of them. He got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, they argued, and he's now wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he went through the trouble and expense to get the pizza, ordered it, and when he found out she had taken toppings off all the pieces, he felt it was selfish. He might feel like she didn't respect his choice or the effort to get the pizza. But the girlfriend's side is that she didn't want a whole piece, so she took some toppings. She might have thought it was okay to take what she wanted without considering that he would mind. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that when she said she would have some of his pizza, he thought she would take a piece or some toppings from one or two pieces. However, she took toppings off all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not have realized that her actions would upset him. She might have thought it was a small thing, especially since he had already eaten his own pieces.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Was his reaction proportionate? The girlfriend did take the toppings, which is a bit odd, but is that selfish? Maybe she didn't consider that he wanted the pizza as it was. However, the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The question is whether his anger was justified. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his feelings without being confrontational. He might have been inconsiderate by not explaining his perspective before getting angry. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of his feelings about the pizza. Also, the fact that he ordered it and was looking forward to it might have made him more sensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, taking toppings off all the pieces might be seen as wasteful or inconsiderate, especially if the author preferred the pizza with all the toppings. The girlfriend might have overstepped by altering the pizza in a way he didn't expect. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author's reaction was in the wrong. If he communicated his feelings calmly, maybe the argument could have been avoided. However, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as not respecting his choice. \n\nI think it's a mix of both. The author's anger might have been a bit over the top, but the girlfriend's actions were also inconsiderate. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he escalated the situation by calling her names and arguing, maybe he's at fault for not handling it more calmly. But the action itself (getting angry) might not be the author's fault if he felt disrespected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author was in the wrong because the situation was trivial, and he overreacted. The girlfriend's actions, while odd, might not warrant such a strong reaction. \n\nI think I need to decide if the author's reaction was justified. If the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, then the author's anger is understandable, but if the reaction was disproportionate, then he's in the wrong. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to see if that's the case. \n\nI think the answer is A for Yes, the author is in the wrong. Because while the girlfriend's actions were odd, the author's response was disproportionate. The situation is about pizza, which is not a big deal, and the argument escalated unnecessarily. The author could have communicated better instead of getting angry and calling her selfish. The girlfriend might not have realized she was wrong, but the author's reaction was harsh. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
