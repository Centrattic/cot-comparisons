It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a specific pizza they were craving, and their girlfriend taking the toppings off every piece, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. So he ordered it. Then after he took two pieces, he went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a long time. When he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took toppings off because she didn't want a whole piece. But the author found out she took toppings from every piece, which he found inconsiderate. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend thought taking some toppings was fine, while the author expected her to eat some pizza. The author felt angry because the pizza was a special, expensive choice they both wanted. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not have considered that the author would be upset about her altering the food. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Did he overreact? The argument was about sharing a meal, and the girlfriend's actions might have been a personal preference, even if it wasn't what the author expected. However, the author didn't ask to split the pizza or specify that he wanted her to eat some. Maybe he should have communicated his expectations better. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have explained her actions sooner instead of waiting until the author was upset. But the question is about who is in the wrong. The author started the fight by calling her selfish and escalating the situation. Even if the girlfriend was inconsiderate in her actions, the author's response might have been harsh. \n\nSo, the answer could depend on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but the author's response of calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion might be his fault. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
