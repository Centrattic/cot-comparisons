It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a specific pizza, eating two slices, and finding out their girlfriend took toppings off every piece. The argument ensued with the author calling her selfish and the girlfriend saying they were acting like a child.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was clear about ordering pizza and asked if the girlfriend wanted anything. She declined but later took toppings from all the remaining slices. The author felt this was selfish because they had already eaten their own slices, but the girlfriend didn't mind sharing the rest. The key here is communication. The author assumed the girlfriend would take some toppings off a few slices, but she took from all. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions, thinking she was just saving some toppings. However, the author was upset because the pizza wasn't just for them; it was a shared order. \n\nNow, considering the argument's escalation. The author called the girlfriend selfish, which might be a harsh reaction. The girlfriend's response was defensive, saying the author was overreacting. The question is whether the author's anger was justified. The author had specific expectations about how the pizza would be shared, which weren't communicated clearly. The girlfriend might have acted without considering that the author valued the pizza highly, given its cost and preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation better. Instead of blaming the girlfriend, maybe discussing it calmly without calling her names would have been better. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was also harsh. The root cause is a communication breakdown. Both parties might have mismanaged expectations here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's reaction was out of proportion in terms of calling the girlfriend selfish and escalating to a big argument over something minor. However, the girlfriend's action was indeed inconsiderate. But the author's approach in handling it was flawed. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for how they handled it, not necessarily the initial frustration. So answer A.\n"
