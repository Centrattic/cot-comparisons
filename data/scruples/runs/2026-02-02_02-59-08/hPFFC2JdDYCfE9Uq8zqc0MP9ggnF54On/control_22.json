It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe user ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it and it's a bit expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when he asked why she wasn't eating, she said she took some toppings off. He thought maybe she took a couple of pieces. But when he went to the kitchen, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong for getting angry over this. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user ordered the pizza because he was starving and had been craving it all day. He offered the pizza to his girlfriend, expecting her to take a piece or maybe a few if she wanted. But instead, she took the toppings off all the pieces, which he found selfish and inconsiderate. The girlfriend's actions might have been unexpected. She thought she could take some toppings without eating a whole piece, maybe to save money or because she didn't want to eat a lot. But the user felt that she was taking from the pizza without considering that he wanted to eat the rest.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, he spent money on a specific pizza he was craving, expecting to enjoy it. His girlfriend's actions left the remaining pizza inedible for him. He might feel that she was being inconsiderate by ruining the pizza he paid for, even if she didn't take it all. The argument escalated because he called her selfish, and she retaliated by saying he was overreacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being practical. She didn't want a whole piece, so she took some toppings. She might not have realized that taking toppings off all the pieces would make the pizza unappealing for the user. Her confusion when he got angry suggests she didn't see the issue, but her actions did affect his meal. \n\nIs the user wrong for getting angry? Well, reacting strongly to something that affects his meal might be seen as reasonable because the pizza was his purchase. However, maybe he could have communicated better instead of immediately calling her selfish. The argument could have been avoided if he explained his feelings calmly. But the girlfriend's actions were indeed taking without considering his preferences. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the user's anger is understandable given the situation. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if unintentionally. However, his response of calling her selfish and escalating the argument might have been harsh. But the main issue is whether he was in the wrong for getting angry. Since the act of taking the toppings was the catalyst, and the user had justified expectations about his pizza, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but it's a bit of a gray area. However, the key point is that the girlfriend's action was selfish, so the user's anger isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
