It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were going to order it and asked if she wanted anything. She said no but said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then he ordered, ate two pieces, and went to watch TV.\n\nThe girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, he asked why she wasn't eating. She said she did, just some toppings off a few pieces. But when the author went to the kitchen, he found she took toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. Now the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. So first, the girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza he ordered. He didn't specify that she couldn't take toppings off, right? Maybe the issue is that he thought she would take a piece or just a little from a few pieces, but she took from all. But the author didn't communicate clearly. When he asked if she wanted anything, she said no, but then took some. Maybe he assumed she wouldn't take any, but she did. But the problem is, he ordered the pizza intending to share, but she took from all the pieces, making it less enjoyable for him. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have thought since he already ate two pieces, she could take some toppings without him mind. Maybe there was a misunderstanding. The author got angry about the way she took toppings, but maybe he could have just asked her to stop or communicated better. He called her selfish, which might have escalated the situation. She thought he was overreacting. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting angry over something that others might see as trivial? Or did the girlfriend overstep by taking toppings from all the pieces without considering his preference? The key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't set clear boundaries about not taking toppings off, and the girlfriend may have assumed it was okay. \n\nBut the author did order the pizza with her in mind, and she agreed to have some. Then she took from all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. However, the argument might have been avoidable if he had communicated that he wanted the toppings left on. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not setting those expectations. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate too. \n\nIn terms of who started the fight, the trigger was the author's anger leading to calling her names. But the initial issue was her taking without considering his preferences. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author had just asked her to leave the toppings on, maybe they could have avoided the argument. But since he didn't, and he got angry, maybe he's at fault for overreacting. Alternatively, her taking toppings from all pieces was selfish. \n\nThe author's defense is that it was a display of selfishness, but others might see it as a minor issue. The answer depends on whether his anger was proportional. Since it's just pizza, maybe he did overreact. However, if the pizza was expensive and he was craving it, maybe his reaction is understandable. \n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the author is partially at fault for not communicating clearly and overreacting by calling her selfish. But the girlfriend was also inconsiderate. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is A because he could have handled it better without escalating into a fight. His anger might have been disproportionate. So Answer A.\n"
