It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place they were craving all day. They offered the pizza to their girlfriend, who said she'd have some of whatever they ordered. The author then took two pieces, went to the living room, and the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When she came back, the author noticed she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece of pizza. The girlfriend was confused about why the author was angry, calling him a child.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The pizza was ordered specifically because the author was craving it, and they mentioned it was more expensive but worth it. The girlfriend agreed to have some of the pizza when asked. However, instead of taking a whole piece or even a partial one, she removed toppings and cheese from all pieces. The author felt this was selfish and inconsiderate because the girlfriend took what she wanted but left the rest for the author to eat, which he found unappealing. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought it was okay because the author had already taken his pieces and she didn't take all the cheese.\n\nNow, considering the perspective of the author: They went through the trouble and expense of getting a specific pizza they wanted, and expected to enjoy it as ordered. The girlfriend's action of modifying all the remaining pieces might have ruined the experience for the author. The author's reaction is frustration over having their meal altered in a way they didn't agree to, possibly feeling disrespected by the girlfriend's assumption that she could take what she wanted without consideration for his preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: She wanted some toppings but didn't take an entire piece, which might have been her way of being considerate. She might have thought it was a reasonable compromise, taking just what she wanted without affecting the author's portions. Her confusion and reaction suggest she didn't perceive her actions as selfish, possibly thinking the author could still eat the modified pizza, albeit differently.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual consideration. The author didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza to stay intact or that he was particular about his toppings. The girlfriend didn't ask if it was okay before modifying the pizza. However, the author's anger might have been a bit over the top given the situation, as it's just pizza, but his feelings of being disrespected are valid. The girlfriend's action could be seen as inconsiderate, but the argument's escalation might be partly on the author for not expressing his needs clearly beforehand. So, while both parties have valid points, the author's reaction might be disproportionate, but the situation is a bit nuanced.\n"
