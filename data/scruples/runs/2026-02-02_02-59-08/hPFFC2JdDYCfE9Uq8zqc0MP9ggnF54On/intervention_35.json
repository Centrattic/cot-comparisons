It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The person ordered pizza from a specific place because they wanted it, even though it's more expensive. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and offered her something. She said no but wanted some toppings from whatever he got.\n\nHe ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and she was in the kitchen a while. Then he noticed she took toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he paid for the pizza, maybe expecting it to be for him. He asked her if she wanted anything, she said no but wanted some toppings. Maybe he thought she meant just a little from one or two pieces, but she took from all. He felt she was being inconsiderate because he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. Maybe he was upset because the pizza was expensive, and she altered it in a way he didn't like. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: she might have felt that since he had already eaten two pieces, the rest was his to do with as he wanted, but she wanted some toppings, maybe because she wasn't hungry otherwise. She might not have realized that removing a lot of the toppings and cheese made the pizza less enjoyable for him. She might have thought it was okay to take what she needed, not considering that he had specific preferences. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The girl said she didn't want a whole piece, just some toppings. The author thought that meant a small amount, but she took more. Maybe he should have specified how much he was okay with her taking, or maybe she should have asked if it was okay to take so much. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from all the pieces and removing cheese might be excessive. \n\nThe author's anger over this might be seen as overreacting, but if the pizza was expensive and he wanted to enjoy it as ordered, maybe it's understandable. The problem is that they didn't communicate clearly. The girlfriend might have thought it was fine to take what she needed without considering the impact on his meal. The author, on the other hand, could have been clearer about his expectations when he offered her the pizza. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the author did order the pizza for himself, and the girlfriend, even though given the option, took more than he expected. But the author's reaction might have been harsh, calling her selfish and leading to a big argument. Maybe the issue is more about the escalation rather than the initial action. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been too strong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was inconsiderate, then the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. But if the author didn't set clear boundaries, he might share some responsibility. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had a right to expect the pizza to stay as it was. Since he ordered it for himself and she was given an option but took without considering his preferences, she's at fault. However, the author's reaction could be seen as overly emotional. But in terms of who is in the wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the girlfriend did act inconsiderately. However, some might argue that the author should have been more accommodating or that the argument was his fault for not setting expectations. \n\nBut considering the girlfriend took a lot from all the pizzas, maybe the author's anger is justified. Still, the way he reacted (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) might have been harsh, leading to escalation. So there's a bit of both. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was being inconsiderate, then the author isn't entirely wrong. However, if the author could have handled it better without yelling, then maybe he shares some blame. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. However, the escalation of the argument might be his fault, but the initial anger isn't entirely his wrong. Alternatively, some might say both are at fault, but the question is about the author specifically. So leaning towards B.\n"
