It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about pizza. The author ordered a pizza they were really craving, asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no, but would have some of what they got. Then, he took two pieces, went to watch TV, and she was in the kitchen for a while. When he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author thought the girlfriend would take toppings off one or two pieces but found that she did it to all pieces. He feels she was selfish. The girlfriend might have thought that since he already had two pieces, the rest was fair game. She might not have considered that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was.\n\nBut the author ordered the pizza because they were starving and wanted a specific place. The girlfriend agreed to have some of what he ordered. Then she took the toppings off all the pieces, making the remaining pizza almost inedible for him. That seems like she didn't respect his order and his preferences. He had a right to expect that his pizza wouldn't be altered in a way that made it unenjoyable. \n\nHowever, maybe their communication was lacking. The author could have mentioned that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was, or check on the pizza before taking all the pieces. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized how important it was for him to have the pizza in its original state. \n\nBut the main issue is that she took the toppings off all the pieces without considering his preference. Even if he had two pieces, the rest was still part of the shared order. Her action of removing toppings from all pieces made the remaining pizza unappealing for him, which is inconsiderate. The author's anger might be justified because his request wasn't respected. However, maybe the author should have been clearer about his expectations when ordering. \n\nBut since she agreed to have some of what he got, altering all the pizza in a way that ruins it for him seems selfish. The author isn't in the wrong for getting angry over his own order being altered. He might have overreacted in the argument, but the initial action of the girlfriend was inconsiderate. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
