It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza they were craving, which is more expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of what he gets. Then he eats two pieces, and when he goes to the kitchen, he finds all the toppings and cheese taken off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author act inconsiderately? He ordered the pizza he wanted without checking if she wanted the same type. She assumed she could take parts off, but maybe she didn't expect to take all the toppings off every piece. When he asked why she wasn't eating, he didn't check if she actually did take some. He just assumed she took a few toppings, but she took all. Then when he found out, he got angry and called her names.\n\nOn the other hand, she did say she wanted some of the toppings. Maybe she thought it was okay to take toppings off without asking. But taking all the toppings off every piece might have been excessive. However, the author ordered the pizza without considering that she might not like the same type. Maybe he should have ordered something else for her or checked if she wanted a different kind. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was defensive, and she didn't consider his feelings when she took the toppings. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and starting an argument might be overreacting. However, the act of taking all the toppings could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, both parties have some responsibility here. The author didn't consider her preferences when ordering, and the girlfriend took extreme measures without communication. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he ordered the pizza without confirming her preferences and then reacted angrily, maybe he's partially at fault. But the girlfriend's actions might have been the main trigger. \n\nHmm, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his anger is justified. The girlfriend took all the toppings, which ruined the pizza for him. But he didn't check if she actually took some before he ate his own. So maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, he could have ordered a different pizza for her. So there's some fault on both sides. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he did order the pizza without considering her preferences and then reacted harshly, maybe he's partially at fault, but the girlfriend's actions were worse. \n\nBut in terms of who started the fight, the author did by getting angry and calling her names. So he's at least partially at fault. So answer A for yes, he's in the wrong. Wait, but maybe the girlfriend's actions were worse. If the user is the author, they might think the other person is at fault, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he ordered the pizza he wanted, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her needs properly. But he could have ordered more pizza or considered her preferences. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that he called her selfish and started an argument, maybe he's at fault for overreacting. So answer A. But I'm not sure. The answer could be B if the author's anger is justified. The girlfriend did take all the toppings, which is inconsiderate. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. It's a tricky one. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was worse, but maybe the author should have considered ordering a different pizza. But the main issue is the girlfriend taking all the toppings. So the author's reaction is understandable. Answer B.\n"
