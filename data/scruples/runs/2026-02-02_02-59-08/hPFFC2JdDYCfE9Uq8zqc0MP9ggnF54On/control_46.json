It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves a girlfriend who ordered pizza for herself and her partner. The girlfriend didn't want a whole pizza, so she took toppings and cheese off every piece, which the author found selfish and inconsiderate. They argue, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and thought the girlfriend would have some. When they found out the girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece, they felt it was selfish. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was being considerate by not eating the whole pizza and leaving some for the author. She might not have realized that the author wanted to eat the pizza as it was.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author asked if the girlfriend wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever pizza he gets. The author might have assumed that she meant she might take a few toppings off a couple of pieces, but instead, she took toppings off every piece. That's a big difference. The girlfriend didn't clarify her exact intentions when she agreed to have some of the pizza. \n\nThe author's reaction was getting angry and calling her selfish, which might be seen as overreacting, but there's a valid point about the girlfriend not respecting the author's preference. The girlfriend's actions left the author with a pizza that wasn't as satisfying, which could be frustrating. However, the argument escalated quickly, and the author might have handled it differently by talking calmly first instead of getting angry.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the extent of her actions. She thought it was fine to take toppings off all the pieces because she wasn't eating the whole pizza. But maybe she didn't consider that the author wanted the pizza as ordered. There's a lack of communication here from both sides. The author didn't specify that they wanted to eat the pizza as it was, and the girlfriend didn't ask if taking toppings off every piece was okay.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The author might have overreacted in terms of the emotional response, but there's also a valid point about the girlfriend not respecting the author's wishes. However, the main issue is that the author started the fight by getting angry and using strong language, which led to the argument. The girlfriend's confusion might indicate that she didn't see her actions as selfish, so the author's anger might have been misplaced. However, the argument could have been avoided if both had communicated better.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's anger might be justified in feeling that their partner was selfish, but the way they reacted (calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate) likely escalated the situation. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps inconsiderate, might not have been intentional. So, while both could have handled it better, the author might be partially at fault for starting the fight with a harsh reaction.\n"
