It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario involves the author ordering pizza for themselves and their girlfriend, who then ends up taking toppings off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza, specifically from a more expensive place they wanted. The girlfriend said she would have some of what he gets, but then took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt it was selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument.\n\nThe girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken two pieces, she was just taking a little from each piece. She might not have considered that the author wanted to eat the pizza as ordered. On the other hand, the author might feel that their request to share the pizza was unmet, leading to the conflict.\n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend didn't realize the impact of her actions. Communication could have been an issue. The author might have expected her to take a whole piece or to discuss eating the pizza differently. However, the author's reaction might have been over the top, especially if the girlfriend didn't take all the toppings and the pizza was still edible. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which could escalate the argument unnecessarily.\n\nThe key points are mutual communication and expectations. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because sharing food is a common practice, and the girlfriend's actions did alter the pizza the author wanted to eat. However, the author's response was harsh, calling the girlfriend names and leading to a big argument over something that isn't a major issue. The girlfriend might not have intended to be selfish but acted based on her own needs without considering the author's preferences.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to approach conflicts with understanding. The author's anger might be justified if they felt disrespected, but the way they addressed it could have been better. The girlfriend's confusion and the author's accusation of selfishness might have stemmed from different expectations. So, while both could have handled the situation better, the author's reaction was perhaps disproportionate, making them partially at fault. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the escalation and the labels used (calling her selfish and childishly acting out), the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
