It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author ordered an expensive pizza they really wanted. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever they got. Then the author ate two pieces. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while and came back not having eaten. When the author checked, the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The author thinks getting angry isn't disproportionate, but the girlfriend said they were acting like a child.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author ordered pizza they wanted, the girlfriend didn't order, but then took toppings off all the pieces. The author felt it was selfish because they had already taken their two pieces, but the girlfriend didn't take a whole piece, just some toppings. The author's anger led to a big argument.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that since they ordered the pizza and the girlfriend didn't order anything, she shouldn't have taken from their order. But on the other hand, maybe the girlfriend thought it was okay because the author had already eaten their share. However, taking toppings off every piece might be seen as wasteful or inconsiderate, even if she didn't take a whole slice. The author might have a point in feeling that their pizza was altered in a way that made it less enjoyable. \n\nBut did the author overreact? If the girlfriend didn't take a full slice, maybe she was trying to be considerate. But the act of taking toppings off all pieces could be seen as selfish. The author's reaction might be justified if they felt the pizza was their order and the girlfriend took from it without considering their enjoyment. However, the argument escalated, and calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have been harsh, especially if the girlfriend didn't realize the impact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have communicated better before getting angry. Maybe they should have discussed the situation calmly instead of jumping to conclusions. The girlfriend might have thought she was being helpful by taking a bit, not thinking it would be an issue. The author's anger led to a fight, which could be seen as disproportionate if the issue wasn't that serious. But the act of altering the pizza might have been a dealbreaker for the author.\n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if they felt the action was inconsiderate. But maybe they could have handled it without a fight. However, the girlfriend's actions were indeed altering the pizza the author ordered. So maybe the author's anger is justified, but their reaction was too harsh. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is wrong for overreacting, then answer A. If not, answer B. \n\nGiven that the author ordered the pizza and had a right to expect it to be as ordered, maybe they're not wrong. But the argument escalated their own anger. It's tricky. I think the author's anger is understandable, but the way they handled it might be the problem. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the girlfriend did take from the order without permission, maybe the author isn't wrong. But maybe the author should have considered that the girlfriend didn't take a full slice. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the action of taking toppings off every piece is inconsiderate. So answer B.\n"
