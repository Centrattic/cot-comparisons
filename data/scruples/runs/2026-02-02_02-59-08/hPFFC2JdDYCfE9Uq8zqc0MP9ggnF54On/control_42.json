It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the described situation is in the wrong. So first, we need to understand both sides of the story.\n\nThe author ordered a specific pizza from an expensive place because they were craving it. They told their girlfriend they were getting it and asked if she wanted anything. She said she would just have some of whatever they got. Then the author took two pieces and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she came back, the author noticed she hadn't eaten. When checking the kitchen, the author found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece of pizza. The author felt angry, called her selfish, and they ended up in an argument.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the author ordered the pizza for themselves, but the girlfriend was allowed to partake. However, the girlfriend modified the pizza in a way that the author found unacceptable. The key points here are consent and communication. The author might have expected that if the girlfriend wanted to modify the pizza, she should have communicated that beforehand. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken pieces, using the remaining pizza as she saw fit was okay.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger stems from the girlfriend altering the pizza without consent, which could be seen as respecting the author's preferences. However, the author also ordered the pizza for both of them, so there's a shared ownership aspect. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating into a big argument might be seen as overreaction, especially since it's just pizza. The girlfriend's response of being defensive and bringing up other issues might have contributed to the argument's escalation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have assumed the pizza was shared, but didn't specify their preferences about toppings. The girlfriend didn't ask before modifying the pizza. However, the author's reaction was harsh, and the argument's escalation suggests that both sides have some responsibility. But the initial act of the girlfriend taking the toppings off every piece without asking could be seen as the catalyst. The author's response of calling her selfish and leading to a big argument might be where their responsibility lies, especially if they didn't communicate their preferences clearly beforehand.\n\nSo considering all factors, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been a bit harsh. However, the argument's escalation is a shared responsibility. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the main issue is the girlfriend's action, the answer is B.\n"
