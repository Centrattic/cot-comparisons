It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was really craving pizza from a specific place because it's worth it even though it's expensive. They told their girlfriend they were starving and ordered it, offering her some. She said she'd just have some of what he gets. Then he ate two pieces, went to the living room. She was in the kitchen for a while, then came back without any. When he asked, she said she took some toppings off the pizza.\n\nHe goes to the kitchen later and finds she took toppings and chunks of cheese off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, first, the girlfriend said she would have some of the toppings. The author assumed she meant taking from one or two pieces, but she took from all. The key here is communication. The author's intention was to share the pizza, but the girlfriend's action was taking what she wanted without considering that the author might be upset about the remaining pizza not being intact. \n\nBut did the author have a right to be angry? Well, maybe. The pizza was ordered as a shared meal, and she modified all the pieces without asking. However, the initial offer was that she would have some of the pizza he got. If she wanted to modify the pizza, maybe she should have discussed it. On the other hand, the author might have expected her to take a portion or maybe not modify all the pieces, which is a bit excessive. \n\nThe argument escalated because the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be harsh, but the girlfriend's actions could be seen as not respecting his purchase or the shared meal. But maybe the author overreacted by calling her names. However, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to start the fight. \n\nThe author's intent was to share, and when someone takes from all the pieces without consideration, that could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend's confusion might indicate a lack of awareness, but the author's anger might stem from feeling disrespected. It's a subjective situation. But in terms of right or wrong, maybe both have some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault here. The girlfriend took without considering the impact on the remaining pizza. The author's anger is a reaction to her actions, which could be inconsiderate. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The key points are consent and sharing. If the pizza was meant to be shared, modifying all the pieces without discussing could be inconsiderate. So the author's reaction is somewhat justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
