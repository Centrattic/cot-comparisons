It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza fight between the author and his girlfriend. The author ordered a specific pizza he wanted, and his girlfriend said she would just have some of what he got. He ate two pieces, then went back to the TV. When he went to get more, he found that his girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they ended up in a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author asked his girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he ordered. He might have expected her to take a piece or maybe some toppings off a couple of pieces, but instead, she took from every piece. That could be seen as not respecting his order or his craving. He might feel like she didn't think about his preferences and altered the pizza he wanted without considering his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he had already eaten two pieces, the rest was fair game. She might not have considered that he wanted the pizza a certain way, with all the toppings intact. She could see it as just rearranging the pizza to suit her own preferences, especially if she didn't take all the cheese and it was still edible.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said she would have some of his order. But maybe they didn't clarify what that meant. The author might have expected her to take a piece, while she thought it was okay to modify the existing pieces. The author got angry because the pizza wasn't as he wanted, but maybe he should have communicated his preference for the pizza to stay as is when he ordered it. However, the girlfriend also didn't ask before modifying the pizza, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIs getting angry over the pizza reasonable? The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be a strong reaction. It's possible that the author overreacted, but the situation is also about personal preferences. The girlfriend didn't ask, which is inconsiderate, but the author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to stay whole. So maybe both sides have a point. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend didn't ask and altered the pizza without consent, that's inconsiderate. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating to a big argument might be the issue. Maybe the author could have handled it with more patience instead of getting angry. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful to his order. So it's a bit of a toss-up. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend did something without asking, but maybe he could have communicated better. However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Given that the girlfriend took the toppings off without asking, she's at fault. The author's anger might be justified because his request was ignored. But maybe he should have been more understanding. Hmm. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. Since the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide. I think it's a mix, but the main issue is the girlfriend's actions. The author's anger is a response to her inconsiderate act. But maybe he should have handled it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the author called her names and escalated, maybe he's in the right to be upset but in the wrong for the reaction. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while perhaps strong, is a response to her actions. Alternatively, maybe A if the author overreacted. But given that the author felt wronged, and the girlfriend didn't ask, I think the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
