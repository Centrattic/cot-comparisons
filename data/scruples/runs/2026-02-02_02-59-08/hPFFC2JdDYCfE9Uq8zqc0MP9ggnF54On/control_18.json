It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything but would have some of whatever he got. Then when the pizza arrived, the author took two pieces, went to watch TV, and the girlfriend was in the kitchen. When he checked, he found out she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was hungry and ordered the pizza, expecting maybe to share. The girlfriend said she didn't want a whole piece but thought she could take toppings off. But the author felt she was being selfish, taking cheese from all the pieces. The girlfriend thought he had already had his two pieces, so there was no problem. The argument escalated, and they brought up other issues.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The author ordered the pizza for himself but maybe expected that the girlfriend would take what was left if she wanted. However, the girlfriend interpreted \"she would have some of whatever he got\" as just taking toppings off the existing pizza. But when she took from all the pieces, that left the author's pieces less satisfying. The author felt it was selfish, but the girlfriend thought she wasn't taking all and that it was still edible.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe he didn't clarify that he wanted the pizza to remain intact. He ordered it for himself but perhaps didn't make it clear that he didn't want her to alter the pizza. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have overstepped by taking from all the pieces without checking with him first. She was confused why he was upset, thinking she was just taking toppings. But the author's reaction was anger, which could be seen as overreacting if the girlfriend didn't take all the cheese and the pizza was still eatable. However, the fact that she took from every piece might have made the remaining pizza less enjoyable for the author, which he felt was inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the author's anger might be justified if he expected the pizza to be shared in a way that both could enjoy it without altering it. The girlfriend might not have realized the extent of her actions. But maybe the author didn't set clear boundaries. It's a bit of a communication breakdown. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings and cheese from all pieces could be seen as selfish, especially if the author was paying for it and wanted to enjoy it as ordered. The author's reaction might be proportionate to the perceived selfishness, but maybe he could have handled it without yelling. But the question is whether he is in the wrong, not just if his reaction was appropriate. Since the girlfriend did alter the pizza without considering his preferences, the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe both have some responsibility here. However, since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, and the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
