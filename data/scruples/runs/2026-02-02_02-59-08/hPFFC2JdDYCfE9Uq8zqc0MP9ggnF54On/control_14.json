It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves ordering expensive pizza, the girlfriend not eating initially, then later taking toppings off every piece, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza for himself and offered the girlfriend some. She said she'd take some of what he got. He took two slices, and when he went to get more, he found the remaining pizza had toppings removed. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's actions: she took toppings off the pizza, which the author then wanted to eat. But she had already eaten some, but maybe not much. The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nPossible angles: The author might feel that since he paid for the pizza and ordered it specifically, the leftovers are his. However, the girlfriend might think that since she's part of the household, she can modify the food as she likes. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she took toppings from a couple of pieces, but she took from all. This lack of communication led to misunderstanding. Also, the girlfriend's response was dismissive, which could escalate the situation. \n\nIs the author wrong? Maybe not entirely. He has a right to be upset if he thought the pizza was his after taking his own slices. However, getting angry over someone else modifying the food might be too much. Also, calling her selfish and inconsiderate could be harsh if she didn't intend to take all the toppings. On the other hand, she did alter the food he wanted to eat without considering his preferences. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting, especially since it's just pizza, but his feelings are valid if he expected the remaining pizza to be untouched. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the way he reacted could be seen as disproportionate. So, there's fault on both sides. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. If the girlfriend modified the food he was going to eat without communication, he's justified in being upset. But the way he escalated it by calling her names and blowing it out of proportion might be his fault. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because his anger stems from a legitimate expectation, but the argument's escalation could be his fault. But the question is about being in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because he overreacted. I think in these situations, both sides have some responsibility, but the question asks if the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend altered the food he wanted to eat, his anger isn't entirely unwarranted. So perhaps B is the answer.\n"
