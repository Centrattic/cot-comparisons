It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza for themselves, and their girlfriend ended up modifying all the pieces by taking off toppings and cheese. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever they ordered. The author assumed she might take toppings off a couple of pieces. However, she took toppings off every single piece, leaving the pizza barely edible, maybe. The author is upset because they paid for the pizza and expected it to be there for their enjoyment. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought since the author had their pieces, taking from the remaining wasn't an issue. She might not see it as selfish because she didn't take the author's specific pieces. But the author's frustration comes from the fact that the entire pizza is now ruined for them, not just their own pieces. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author might have expected that the remaining pizza would be left intact for them. The girlfriend didn't communicate her actions and didn't consider that removing toppings from all pieces would affect the author's enjoyment. However, the author also ordered a specific type of pizza, which the girlfriend didn't want, so maybe she didn't want to eat that type in the first place. But she didn't mention that when the order was placed. \n\nWas the author wrong to get angry? The girlfriend did take without consideration, but the author could have communicated better. If the author was going to order something specific, maybe they should have checked if the girlfriend wanted to share or not. However, since the girlfriend agreed to have some, the author might have assumed the pizza would be shared or at least left as is. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction might have been over the top. Still, it's about differing expectations. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the girlfriend's actions were selfish, but the author's response might have been overly harsh. However, the author's frustration is understandable because their order was compromised. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't respect the pizza they paid for. But maybe the author could have handled it without yelling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. The argument might have been escalated, but the initial action of the girlfriend was the main issue.\n"
