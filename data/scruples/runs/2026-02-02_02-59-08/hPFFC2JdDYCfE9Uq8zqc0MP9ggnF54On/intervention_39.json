It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out his girlfriend had removed toppings and cheese from all the remaining pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, she'd have some of whatever he got. So he orders, and then when he goes to get more, she's taken toppings off all the pieces. He's upset because he thought she might take some toppings off a couple pieces, but not all. She thought she was just taking a bit and that it's still okay to eat. He calls her selfish and they argue. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that the girlfriend would take some toppings off a couple pieces, but she did it to all pieces. Maybe there was a miscommunication. The author ordered the pizza, ate two pieces, but the rest were for both of them. The girlfriend took toppings off all the remaining pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. But she might have thought she was just helping herself a little, not realizing he wanted to eat the rest later. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off every piece could be seen as inconsiderate if she knew he wanted to eat them. However, she might not have realized that he intended to eat those pieces later. The author's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially since she was in the kitchen and he didn't check on her. Maybe he should have considered that she might prefer to have the pizza without certain toppings, or that she wasn't going to eat all of it. \n\nBut then again, he had already eaten two pieces, and the rest were presumably for both of them. If he didn't specify that he wanted the remaining pieces to stay whole, maybe the girlfriend had the right to modify them as she saw fit. The author's anger might stem from not communicating his preferences clearly. He could have mentioned that he wanted the pizza as is for the rest of the time he'd be eating it. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't set clear expectations. The girlfriend might not have realized that he wanted the pizza untouched. However, her action of taking toppings off all pieces could also be seen as selfish if she knew he intended to eat them. But since she said she didn't take all the cheese and it's still edible, maybe she didn't consider it a big deal. \n\nThe argument escalated because of miscommunication. The author's reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have been too harsh, especially if he didn't clarify his needs beforehand. On the other hand, she could have checked with him before modifying the pizza. \n\nIn conclusion, both parties might have contributed to the conflict, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his preferences clearly and his reaction was over the top, it's possible he's in the wrong. But if the girlfriend took the pizza without considering he might want to eat it later, she's also at fault. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that he made assumptions and didn't check in with her, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted. Another angle: the girlfriend's action was selfish, so the author's anger is justified. But the way he expressed it was wrong. Hmm.\n"
