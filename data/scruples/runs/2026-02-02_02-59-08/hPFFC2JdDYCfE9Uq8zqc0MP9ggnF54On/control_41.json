It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were really craving it. The girlfriend said she would have some of whatever he got. He orders, eats two pieces, then goes to the living room. She comes back after a while, and when he asks why she didn't eat, she says she took toppings off some pieces. But he later finds out she took toppings off every piece, which makes him angry. She didn't think it was a big deal, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was looking forward to a specific pizza he paid for, maybe even a splurge because it's more expensive. He expected to share, but he ordered it for himself and then offered her to have some. She agreed, so he probably thought she would take a piece or maybe a slice. But she took toppings off all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. He felt she was being selfish because she altered the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment, even if she didn't take all the cheese. \n\nOn her side, she might have thought that since he had already eaten two pieces, it was okay for her to use the remaining pizza how she wanted. She might not have considered that removing toppings from all pieces would make the remaining pizza less enjoyable for him. Also, she might have thought she was being helpful by not taking the whole thing, but taking toppings off to save money or food. However, her action of removing toppings from every piece seems excessive. If she wanted to use the toppings, maybe she could have taken a few pieces or just one. But doing it to all pieces might show a lack of consideration for his preference and the value he placed on the pizza.\n\nThe author's anger might be justified because he paid for the pizza, was looking forward to it, and she changed it in a way that made it less enjoyable for him. However, he did call her selfish and inconsiderate, which could be seen as harsh if she didn't realize the impact of her actions. But the key issue is whether her actions were inconsiderate. If she knew he valued the pizza highly, removing toppings from all pieces without his knowledge is inconsiderate. \n\nThe argument escalated because he called her names and she felt he was overreacting. But the root of the problem is her action. If she had taken just a few toppings or slices, maybe he wouldn't have been upset. But she took from all pieces, which he found unacceptable. So the author's reaction might be reasonable given the situation. However, getting angry and calling her names could have been handled differently. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could have communicated better. He could have asked for her preference before ordering, and she could have discussed her intention to take toppings off instead of doing it without his knowledge. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she didn't ask and altered the pizza in a way that affected his enjoyment, the author's anger is understandable. But getting into a big argument over pizza might be seen as overreacting. However, given that it was a specific, expensive pizza he was craving, it's a valid point. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were inconsiderate without communication, but there's a balance in how he reacted. However, the core issue is her action, not his reaction. Alternatively, if his reaction was overly harsh, maybe A. But given the context, the author's frustration is justified.\n"
