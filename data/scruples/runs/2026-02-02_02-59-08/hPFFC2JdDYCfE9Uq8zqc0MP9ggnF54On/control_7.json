It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. So, first, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe author ordered pizza from an expensive place they wanted, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. Then, the author ate two pieces, went back to watch TV, and when they went to the kitchen later, they found the girlfriend had removed toppings and cheese from all the pizza pieces. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had an argument.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's actions: she said she didn't want a whole piece, so she took toppings off. But the author interpreted that as taking from what he had already ordered. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that the pizza was their own, but the girlfriend might have thought it was a shared order since she agreed to have \"some\" of it. However, when the author ordered it, they didn't specify that it was for them alone. So maybe the girlfriend acted based on the understanding that the pizza was for both, hence taking parts from it. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on the belief that the girlfriend took from what was ordered for them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have felt it was okay since she was part of the order. The argument escalated because of the lack of clear communication. The author might have been inconsiderate by not clarifying the order, and the girlfriend might have overstepped by taking from the pizza without discussing it. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author got angry and called the girlfriend selfish. The toppings were a significant part of the pizza they craved, which the girlfriend removed. However, the girlfriend didn't take a whole piece, just some toppings. The author's reaction could be seen as overreacting because it's just pizza, as they mentioned. However, if the pizza was a personal order and the girlfriend took parts from it without permission, then the author has a point. \n\nBut the initial request was \"if she wanted anything,\" which she said \"no\" to, but then took some toppings later. The ambiguity in the order's ownership is key. The author didn't specify that the pizza was solely theirs, so the girlfriend might have thought sharing was okay. The author's anger could be justified if they felt their order was being taken from them, but the girlfriend's actions might have been based on a misunderstanding. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the author had clarified that the pizza was theirs alone, the girlfriend wouldn't have taken toppings. The author's reaction could be seen as over the top because it's not a major issue, but their anger stems from feeling disrespected. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No) because the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's also room to say that the author could have communicated better to avoid the situation. However, the girlfriend's actions did encroach on the author's order without clear permission. The main issue is the lack of communication from both sides. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the girlfriend's actions were unexpected and the author had a right to be upset, maybe the answer isn't A. But if the author escalated the situation by calling the girlfriend selfish, that's where the fault might lie. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the answer is B because the author isn't in the complete wrong, but there's some shared responsibility.\n"
