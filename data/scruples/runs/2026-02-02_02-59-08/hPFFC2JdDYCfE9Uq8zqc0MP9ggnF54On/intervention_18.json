It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the AITA ordered pizza from an expensive place because he was craving it. He offered the girlfriend some, and she said she'd take some toppings from whatever he got. He didn't think she'd take a lot, but when he went to the kitchen, he found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and a big argument ensued.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend might not have realized the expense or the significance of the pizza to him. She thought she was being considerate by only taking some toppings. However, the way she did it\u2014removing from all the pieces\u2014might have seemed inconsiderate to him, especially if he had to eat the leftovers without toppings or cheese, which could affect his enjoyment.\n\nThe author's anger might be proportional if he felt that her action was a lack of consideration for his expense and his preference. On the other hand, maybe he overreacted because it's just pizza, and she was trying to take a small portion. But since she took from all the pieces, it's possible he had to eat the remaining pizza without toppings, which could be a dealbreaker for him. \n\nThe girlfriend's confusion and her reaction that he's acting like a child might have escalated things. But the core issue is about differing expectations and communication. The author didn't clarify beforehand that he wanted to eat the pizza as is. He might have assumed she would take one or two pieces, not modify all the pizza. His anger stems from that unmet expectation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend might not have realized the importance of the pizza to him, but the author also didn't specify his boundaries. However, the act of removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as taking more than he expected. The author's reaction might be justified if he felt disrespected, but maybe it's an overreaction. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because his feelings were hurt by what he perceived as selfishness. But he could have communicated his preferences better. However, since the girlfriend's action wasn't malicious and she was trying to be considerate by not taking the whole piece, maybe the author overreacted. But given that she took from all the pieces, making the pizza less enjoyable for him, his anger might be reasonable. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because his reaction, while possibly intense, was based on his own expectations not being communicated and the modification of the pizza he paid for. The girlfriend's confusion doesn't negate his feelings about the situation. So, the answer is B.\n"
