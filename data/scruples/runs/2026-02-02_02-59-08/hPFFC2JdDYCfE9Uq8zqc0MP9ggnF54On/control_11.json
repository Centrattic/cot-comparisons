It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza. The writer ordered pizza from an expensive place because they were craving it. They offered their girlfriend some, and she said she'd take some of whatever he got. He then took two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he checked later, she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are: the girlfriend said she would have some of whatever pizza he got, which he took as her wanting a piece. But she interpreted it as she could take parts from the pizza without him needing to order another. He felt she was being selfish by taking toppings from all pieces, making them inedible for him. She thought she was within her rights because he had already taken his share. \n\nThe question is about communication. When he ordered pizza and asked if she wanted anything, maybe he should have clarified that he wanted to order for both of them, or that he expected her to have her own pieces. But she assumed she could take parts from his order. However, when she took toppings from every piece, that's a problem because it's not just taking one piece but modifying all the remaining ones, which affects his ability to enjoy the pizza. \n\nIs it reasonable to get angry over this? The author felt she was being selfish, but maybe he could have handled it without yelling. However, the girlfriend's actions did affect him. She might not have considered that he wouldn't want his pizza altered. On the other hand, maybe the author should have ordered enough pizza so both could have their own, or communicated better that he wanted to share. \n\nBut the main issue is that she changed the pizza he ordered in a way that made it less enjoyable for him, without asking. That's a breach of mutual respect. So the author's anger is understandable. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and the argument escalating might have been excessive. The girlfriend might have a point in that he didn't order for both, but she also didn't respect his order. \n\nIn terms of who is more in the wrong, the girlfriend took without considering his preferences, but the author could have been more communicative. However, the question is about the author's actions. He ordered the pizza, offered her something, and she modified it without consent. His anger stems from feeling disrespected. So maybe he isn't entirely wrong, but there's some fault on both sides. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (No) because he had a valid reason to be upset about his pizza being altered without his consent.\n"
