It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The author ordered the pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out his girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that since he ordered the pizza and she agreed to have some of it, she shouldn't have modified all the remaining pieces. He could see her actions as taking without considering his preferences, especially since he was the one who paid for it. However, the girlfriend might argue that since he had already taken his portions, she was within her right to adjust the leftovers to her taste. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author clarify that he wanted the pizza prepared a certain way, or did he assume she would respect his choices? The girlfriend might not have realized that taking toppings off all the pieces would affect his remaining slices. On the other hand, the author's reaction seems a bit intense for the situation. Calling someone selfish and starting a big argument over pizza might be disproportionate, even if there was a misunderstanding.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that she was \"genuinely confused\" and didn't take all the cheese off. So maybe the issue was a miscommunication rather than intentional selfishness. The author's anger leading to a fight could be seen as overreacting, especially if the girlfriend didn't intend to be inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate clearly and consider each other's perspectives. The author might have made assumptions about how the pizza should be handled without discussing it. His reaction, while based on feeling disrespected, could be seen as the catalyst for the argument. Therefore, he might be at fault for not addressing the issue calmly or preemptively explaining his expectations.\n"
