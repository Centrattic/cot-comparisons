It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering a specific pizza they were craving, and their girlfriend taking toppings off every piece when she didn't want a whole piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza they wanted, which was expensive but worth it. They offered the girlfriend a share, and she said she'd have some. Then, when the author ate two pieces, the girlfriend took toppings off all the remaining pieces. The author was upset because they expected the pizza to remain as ordered, but the girlfriend didn't take a whole piece, just some toppings.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they paid for the pizza, made a specific order, and the girlfriend altered it without their consent. They might feel that their choice and effort (and money) were disrespected. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was being polite by taking a little and not eating a whole piece, but didn't consider that the author wanted the pizza as it was. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't clarify that they wanted the pizza to be untouched, and the girlfriend didn't ask if she could alter it. Both might have had different assumptions. The author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. The girlfriend's response of being confused and defensive suggests she didn't realize the impact of her actions.\n\nIn terms of who is at fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author could have been more explicit about not wanting the pizza modified. However, the girlfriend did alter the food the author paid for without consent, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's anger might be misplaced if they didn't communicate their expectations clearly. However, the girlfriend's action was disrespectful to the author's choice.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the right to be upset, but their reaction (calling her selfish and inconsiderate) was harsh. The girlfriend also failed to communicate her needs better. But since the question is about who is in the wrong, the author's actions in escalating the argument could be seen as the wrong part, even if they had a valid frustration. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's action was the main issue, then the author isn't at fault. However, since the author chose to react angrily without addressing it calmly, that could make them at fault. But maybe the girlfriend's action was the main issue. It's a tough call. The answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was disproportionate. Since the author called the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, and the girlfriend didn't realize the impact, maybe the author was inconsiderate in their response. So leaning towards answer A.\n"
