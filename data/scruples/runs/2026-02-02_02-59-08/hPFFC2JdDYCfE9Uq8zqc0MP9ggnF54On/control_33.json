It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry about their girlfriend taking toppings off every pizza slice. \n\nFirst, the context: The author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they really wanted. They offered their girlfriend some, and she initially said she'd take some of whatever the author got. Then, when the pizza arrived, the author took two slices and went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen, and when she came back, the author noticed she wasn't eating. It turns out she took toppings off every piece, not just one or two as the author had assumed. \n\nThe author got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate. She responded by saying the author was being a child. They ended up in a big argument. The question is whether the author was wrong for getting so upset.\n\nSo, considering the points: The author had a specific craving for a more expensive pizza, which they paid for. They expected to share it, but the girlfriend modified all the slices, making them less edible for the author. The author's frustration is understandable because their expectation of sharing was not met, and the modification of the entire pizza could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction\u2014calling their partner selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument\u2014might be seen as overreacting, especially since it's just pizza. The key here is whether the level of anger was disproportionate. The girlfriend might have felt she was within her rights to take toppings if she didn't want a whole slice. But the act of modifying every piece could be seen as taking without consent, which is where the author's frustration comes from. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, getting upset over a shared meal being altered without discussion is reasonable. But blowing up into a big argument and calling someone selfish could be seen as an overreaction. However, the act of modifying all the pizza might have been the real issue, not just taking a few toppings. The girlfriend's response of being defensive and dismissing the author's feelings could have escalated things.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had asked first, or if the girlfriend had communicated her preference upfront, maybe the issue could have been avoided. But the author's anger stems from unmet expectations and a possible lack of respect for their choice. It's a gray area. Depending on cultural norms or personal relationship dynamics, some might side with the author, others with the girlfriend. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer likely depends on whether their anger was justified. Given that the girlfriend altered the entire pizza without consent, maybe the author wasn't entirely wrong. But the way they handled it could be better. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but their reaction might have been harsh.\n"
