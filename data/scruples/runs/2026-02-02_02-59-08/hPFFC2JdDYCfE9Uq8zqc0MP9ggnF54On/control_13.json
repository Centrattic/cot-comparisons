She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves a girlfriend taking toppings off all the pizza pieces, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the writer ordered a specific pizza they were craving. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, but planned to have some of what he got. When he went to eat, he took two pieces, then later found out she took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. She thought he was overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the writer do something wrong? Was his reaction justified? The writer felt the girlfriend was being selfish by taking the toppings off all the pieces, which he might have wanted to eat. However, he had already taken two pieces for himself. The girlfriend might not have realized the significance of the pizza to him, especially since it was from a specific place and more expensive. \n\nBut wait, he did ask her if she wanted anything, and she declined. So maybe he didn't consider that she might still want some later. Also, the fact that she took toppings from all pieces might have been unexpected, but he didn't check on the pizza until he noticed she wasn't eating. Perhaps he should have communicated better or set clearer expectations about the pizza being his choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized how important it was to him. She thought she could have some toppings without taking all of them. The writer's reaction could be seen as over the top since he had already taken his share. However, the way he called her selfish and inconsiderate might have been harsh, especially if she didn't intend to take all the toppings. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? If he had considered that she might want toppings even after he took his pieces, maybe he should have ordered more or communicated his preference for keeping the pizza whole. Alternatively, if he was clear that the pizza was his choice and he wanted it as ordered, then her taking toppings without discussing it could be seen as selfish. \n\nBut the main issue is that he got angry and called her names, which led to an argument. Maybe the fight wasn't necessary. The girlfriend might have felt entitled to use the pizza as she saw fit since he offered her some. So, the writer's reaction might be inconsiderate of her perspective. \n\nIn summary, both might have miscommunicated. But the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Since he ordered the pizza himself, took two pieces, and then got upset when she modified the remaining pizza, it's possible he didn't set clear boundaries. His anger might have been disproportionate, making him at fault for escalating the situation. However, her actions could also be seen as selfish. But in terms of who started the fight, the writer's reaction is the focus here. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he overreacted and didn't consider her actions as not taking all the pizza, just modifying it. Or B (not in the wrong) because he had a right to be upset about his favorite pizza being altered without consent. But I need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
