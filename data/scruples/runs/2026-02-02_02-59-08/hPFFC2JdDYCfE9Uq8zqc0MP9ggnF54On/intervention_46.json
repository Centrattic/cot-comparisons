It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. He orders, eats two pieces, then later finds out that the girlfriend took toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear about ordering the pizza, maybe even seeing it as a treat because it's more expensive. He might feel that she didn't communicate her intentions and took from every piece, which could be seen as greedy or inconsiderate. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the significance of the pizza to him. She took some toppings, thinking it's okay since he had already eaten some. She might not see it as a big deal, hence her confusion and frustration when he got angry.\n\nCommunication seems like a key issue here. The author didn't specify that he wanted to eat the pizza as is without modifications. Maybe the girlfriend didn't understand that the pizza was a personal preference or something he really wanted. Also, when she took the toppings, she might have thought it was a practical way to make it work for her taste, not realizing how much the author valued the pizza.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author overreact? The pizza is still edible, so maybe she didn't take all of it. However, the author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the argument. The girlfriend's response was defensive, which could indicate that she felt misunderstood. It's possible that both had valid points but failed to communicate properly.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he didn't clarify that the pizza was important to him and his preferences, he might have contributed to the misunderstanding. On the flip side, she might have asked if she could adjust the pizza instead of just taking from every piece. Maybe both are at fault here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger led to a big argument, so maybe he's overreacting. But if she took all the toppings, that's a valid reason for frustration.\n\nHmm. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations. In some relationships, sharing food and modifying it isn't a big deal. In others, it's seen as intrusive. The author's reaction might be inconsiderate if he didn't account for her preferences, but her not asking first could also be an issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario.\n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend took without considering his preferences, but maybe the author could have communicated better. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's anger is justified. Alternatively, the author's tone and choice of words (\"calling her selfish\") might have been the wrong approach. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not being clear, but the main issue was her actions. It's a bit of a toss-up. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. I'll go with B because the girlfriend's actions were the main problem, and the author's frustration is understandable. However, if the author could have been more accommodating, maybe he's partially wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend took without asking, and the author's reaction was justified, maybe the answer is B.\n"
