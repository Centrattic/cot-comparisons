It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place they really wanted, even though it's a bit expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he gets. Then he orders, takes two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, she's already eaten, according to her. But when the author checks the kitchen, he finds that she's removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nHmm. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user themselves think the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author ordered the pizza for himself, knowing the girlfriend would have some. He took two pieces for himself and left the rest. The girlfriend took some toppings off every piece, which made the author angry. But why did he get so upset? The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nThe author assumed that when the girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he gets, she would just take a piece or two. But she took toppings off every piece, maybe thinking that's how she wanted to eat it. However, the author didn't specify that he wanted to keep the pizza as it was. Maybe he didn't mention that he wanted to eat the pizza with all toppings, so she didn't realize modifying it would affect him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend took from all the pieces, not just one or two. That could be seen as using up the pizza in a way that made it less enjoyable for the author. But was it selfish? Maybe she didn't think about how removing toppings would affect his eating experience. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The problem here is that there wasn't clear communication about how they wanted to share the pizza. The author might have expected her to take a piece or two, not alter all of them. However, the girlfriend might not have realized that removing toppings would be a big deal. \n\nWas the author wrong? Well, he did order the pizza for himself and took two pieces. Maybe he should have communicated his preference to keep the pizza whole. If he didn't specify, then maybe he's partly at fault for not setting clearer expectations. However, the girlfriend taking toppings off every piece without considering that he might want to eat them as they were could be inconsiderate. \n\nBut in a relationship, it's important to consider how your actions affect the other person. If the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, that might be using the pizza in a way that wasn't fair. However, the author also didn't clarify that he wanted to eat the pizza as it was. So both might have some responsibility here. \n\nThe author's anger might be disproportionate if he's just upset about the toppings being removed, even though there's still pizza to eat. But if the way she modified the pizza made it less enjoyable for him, that's a valid concern. The girlfriend's confusion about why he's angry suggests a miscommunication. \n\nIn conclusion, both parties might have some fault. The author didn't specify how he wanted the pizza shared, and the girlfriend took actions that affected his enjoyment. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author called her selfish and started the argument, maybe he overreacted. However, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as selfish too. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A for yes, then the author is at fault. If B, then not. Considering the situation, the author might have been wrong to get so angry without communicating his needs first. He should have asked if she wanted to take a slice or if she had preferences. Instead, he assumed she would take a piece, not alter all the pizza. So the author's fault is not in the argument itself but in the lack of communication leading up to it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not setting clearer expectations. But the girlfriend's actions also contributed. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend took toppings off all the pizza without considering he wanted to eat them, she's at fault. The author's anger is a reaction to her actions. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. It's hard to say. The answer could go either way. But given that the author ordered the pizza and took two slices, maybe he should have considered that she might want to take some as well. But she went further than just taking a slice. \n\nI think the most balanced view is that both are partially at fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for a choice between A and B, and the user thinks A (author is wrong), but I need to decide. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is wrong because he didn't communicate his needs. In others, the girlfriend is wrong. Since the user is asking, maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe B. \n\nWait, the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. If the girlfriend was confused, maybe the author shouldn't have used such strong words. So maybe the author is wrong in the way he reacted, even if the situation had elements of misunderstanding. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A.\n"
