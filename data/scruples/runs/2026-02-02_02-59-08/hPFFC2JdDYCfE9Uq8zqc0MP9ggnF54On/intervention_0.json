It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered expensive pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it. They told their girlfriend and offered her some, which she declined. Then the author ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and later found out that the girlfriend took toppings off all the remaining pieces. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that since they paid for the pizza and ordered it because they craved it, it's their meal. The girlfriend agreed to have some of whatever pizza the author gets, but later took toppings off all the pieces. The author might think that this was inconsiderate because they were left with less or ruined pizza. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since she didn't order it and the author already had their share, she was just taking what she needed without considering the author's feelings.\n\nWait, but the author paid for the pizza. If you order something because you want it, and then someone else messes with it, that's probably going to be frustrating. However, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already eaten their portions, the remaining pizza was fair game. But maybe she should have asked first or communicated better. The author might have expected that the pizza was for both of them to share, even if the girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything. The fact that the author ordered it for themselves but expected the girlfriend to have some of it might be a point of contention. Also, the girlfriend took toppings off every piece, which seems excessive. Maybe she didn't realize how much the author wanted the pizza or valued it. \n\nThe author called the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate. Is that justified? Well, if the author paid for the pizza and ordered it because they really wanted it, the girlfriend's action of altering the remaining pizza without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. However, maybe the author should have clarified that the pizza was for both of them, even if the girlfriend initially declined. The girlfriend might not have known that the author wanted to share it. So maybe both sides have some responsibility here. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author got angry and called the girlfriend names. The argument escalated because the author felt wronged. But the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pieces without communication could be seen as selfish. However, the author might have assumed that the girlfriend would respect the meal he paid for. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. On the other hand, if the author had already eaten their share, maybe the girlfriend had the right to use the remaining pizza as she saw fit. But taking toppings off all the pieces might have been an overreaction. \n\nHmm. I think the key points are: the author ordered pizza for themselves, offered it to the girlfriend who declined, ate their own portions, then found the remaining pizza altered. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to use the leftovers, but the way she did it (taking toppings off all pieces) was excessive and didn't consider the author's feelings. The author's anger might be justified because the pizza was important to them, but the girlfriend might not have realized that. However, the author could have communicated better about not wanting the pizza messed with. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, maybe both are a bit responsible. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author called the girlfriend selfish and the argument started, but the girlfriend did alter the pizza in a way that could be seen as inconsiderate, the answer might be B (no, the author isn't in the wrong). But if the author shouldn't have expected the girlfriend to not use the leftover pizza they paid for, then maybe A (yes, the author is in the wrong). \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have considered that the girlfriend might use the leftovers. If the author ordered it for themselves and expected the girlfriend to have some, but then got angry when she used the remaining pizza in a way he didn't like, the author might be in the wrong. However, if the author paid for it and the girlfriend took without considering how much he wanted it, then the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, so the author's anger might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
