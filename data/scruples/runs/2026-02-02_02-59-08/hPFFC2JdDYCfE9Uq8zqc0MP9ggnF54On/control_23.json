She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place because they really wanted it, even though it's a bit expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but mentioned she'd have some of whatever he gets. \n\nHe orders the pizza, eats two pieces, and goes back to watch TV. His girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when he checks, she says she ate some toppings but didn't take a whole piece. He thought she took toppings off a few slices. But when he went to the kitchen, he found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate. She got defensive, said he was acting like a child, and they ended up in a big argument.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author ordered expensive pizza he was craving. He offered the food to his girlfriend, who initially said she'd have some. Then she ended up taking toppings off all the slices, leaving the pizza less than she thought. He got upset because he felt she was being selfish, but she didn't see it that way. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he paid for the pizza, probably expecting to share it. When he goes to eat more, he finds the pizza modified in a way that makes it less enjoyable for him. He's upset because he paid for it, and she took it without considering his preferences. But did he overreact?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole slice. But taking toppings off every piece might be excessive. However, maybe she didn't realize the extent of her actions. The author might have assumed she only took a little, but she ended up taking a lot. Communication might have been an issue here. The author didn't check if she took any before he ate his own slices. He just assumed she took a little. When he found out she took more than he expected, he got angry. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for getting angry? Well, if he had checked the pizza before eating his own, maybe he could have addressed the issue earlier. But he didn't, and he waited until he needed more pizza to realize the problem. His reaction might have been a bit out of proportion since it's just pizza. However, if he paid for it and expected to share, maybe he had a right to be upset. But calling her selfish and saying she's inconsiderate might be harsh. She might have thought she was being considerate by not taking a whole slice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend was wrong for modifying the pizza without discussing it. If she didn't like the toppings, she could have asked for a different pizza or not eaten it. Taking toppings off all pieces without consulting him could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that there was a previous conversation where he was excited about the pizza and she agreed to have some might mean that her actions later were disrespectful. \n\nBut the author's approach in calling her selfish and inconsiderate, and escalating into a big argument, might not be the right way to handle it. Maybe he should have calmly talked about it instead of getting angry. However, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as the initial problem. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's possible that both have some responsibility. The author didn't check the pizza before eating his portions, and the girlfriend didn't consider that modifying all the pizza would affect him. But the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the answer is A (yes, the author is wrong), it might be because he overreacted to a minor issue. But if it's B (no), it's because the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish and the author had a right to be upset. \n\nConsidering that the author paid for the pizza and the girlfriend modified it without considering his preferences, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, his reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to a big argument, might have been too harsh. But if her actions were genuinely inconsiderate, maybe he's justified. \n\nHmm. This is a bit tricky. The key points are whether the author's anger was proportionate. Since the pizza was expensive and he was craving it, and she took all the toppings off every piece, that's a significant modification. But he did order it for both of them, so she might have had the right to take some. However, the way she did it (taking all toppings) could be seen as selfish. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was defensive, which adds to the problem. If the author had approached it calmly, maybe they could have resolved it. But his anger might be justified if he felt his preferences were ignored. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and how people view shared meals. In some contexts, sharing food is expected, and modifying it without consent could be seen as wrong. But the author's reaction might have been too intense. \n\nGiven that the author called her selfish and the argument escalated, maybe he's partly at fault. But if the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate, then he's not entirely wrong. \n\nIn the end, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B), and considering that both parties have some fault, but the main issue is her taking the toppings without discussion, I might lean towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were more inconsiderate, and he had a right to be upset. However, his reaction could have been better handled. But since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B.\n"
