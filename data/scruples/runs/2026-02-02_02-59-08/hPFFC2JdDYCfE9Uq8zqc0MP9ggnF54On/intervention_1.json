It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place, asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, she said no but then took toppings off all the pieces later. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm, so first, the author ordered the pizza because they were really craving it. They mentioned it's a more expensive place, so maybe they had high expectations. The girlfriend initially said she didn't want anything but then later took toppings off every piece. The author thought she took just one or two, but she actually did all of them. That's a key point. The author felt her action was inconsiderate because she didn't tell them beforehand, and maybe they thought she should have communicated better.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend didn't order any pizza, so technically, the author might have assumed she wasn't going to eat it. However, when she asked for toppings, maybe she should have done that before the author started eating. But the girlfriend might have thought it was okay since the author had already eaten two pieces. The author's reaction was anger and calling her selfish, which escalated the situation. The girlfriend defended herself by saying she didn't take all the cheese, so she thought it was still edible. The author's frustration could be because they were hungry and wanted their pizza as is. But maybe overreacting?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did take some of the toppings without asking, which could be seen as a breach of consideration. However, the author didn't warn her that they wouldn't mind if she wanted toppings off. Maybe the author should have communicated that they wanted their pizza a certain way. The fact that the author got so angry over this might be a sign of overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't ask first. But the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate as well. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The answer options are A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No, the author is not in the wrong). \n\nI think the author's anger led to escalating the situation. While the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, the author's reaction might have been more intense than necessary. The argument could have been avoided with better communication from both sides. However, the girlfriend did take toppings off all pieces, which could be seen as taking without asking. The author might have a point in feeling upset, but reacting with anger and calling her selfish might be the root of the problem. So, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps both have some responsibility. But according to AITA standards, the answer is usually more black and white. If the girlfriend was the one who took without asking, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but their reaction could still be seen as over the top. Alternatively, the author's initial reaction to the situation might be justified if they felt their meal was being altered without consent. But since the girlfriend didn't ask, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the answer is B (No), because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's anger stems from that. However, the author's reaction might be seen as excessive. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. If the author's anger was about a valid concern (girlfriend taking toppings without asking), then maybe not. But if the fight was overreacting, then maybe A. It's tricky. I think in AITA, if both parties have some fault, but the main issue is the other person's actions, the answer might be B. Alternatively, if the author's reaction was the main problem, then A. Given the details, the author's anger was about the girlfriend's inconsiderate action, so maybe B is correct.\n"
