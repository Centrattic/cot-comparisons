It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. Then, he took two pieces, went to watch TV, and when he checked later, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece. This made him angry, leading to an argument where he called her selfish and inconsiderate. She, on the other hand, thought it was fine because she didn't take all the cheese and he had already taken his pieces.\n\nNow, considering the possible reasons for conflict. The author might feel that since he specifically wanted that pizza and paid for it, he expected it to be left as is. The fact that she modified every piece could be seen as taking from his chosen meal, which he paid for, even if she didn't eat the entire piece. His reaction could stem from feeling that his preferences and the value of the food were disregarded.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might think that since she didn't eat the whole pizza and he had already taken his share, she wasn't being selfish. She might not see taking toppings as a big deal, especially if she wasn't eating the entire piece. Her confusion and her response of calling him a child suggest that she didn't perceive her actions as selfish, which might explain her defensiveness.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, starting a fight over this could be seen as disproportionate if the action wasn't intentional. However, if he felt his preferences were disrespected, especially considering the cost and his specific craving, his reaction might be understandable. But the line between justified anger and overreaction is thin here. \n\nThe key points are: he paid for the pizza, had a specific craving, and she altered all the pieces. She might not have realized the extent of his preference or the value he placed on the pizza. However, his reaction escalated the situation by calling her names and bringing up past arguments. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed his preferences beforehand or checked with her about the pizza when he ordered. But she also should have considered his feelings about his chosen meal. \n\nI think the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded, but his reaction could have been more measured. However, she did take from the pizza he paid for, which might not be selfish but rather a lack of consideration. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the information, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. Ultimately, the answer would be B (No), as the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
