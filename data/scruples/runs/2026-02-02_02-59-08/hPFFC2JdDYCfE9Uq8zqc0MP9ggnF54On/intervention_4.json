It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then noticed later that she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed she would either take a piece or not eat it, but she did something in between\u2014taking toppings off all pieces. The problem is that he ordered a specific pizza he wanted, which was expensive, and she altered it in a way that might not have been communicated. \n\nWait, he asked her if she wanted anything, she said she'd have some of whatever he got. So he ordered it. Then when it arrived, he ate first. She didn't eat immediately, went to the kitchen, and then took toppings off all pieces. He was upset because the pizza was his, and she modified it without asking. She might have thought since it was shared, she could adjust it to her taste. But he might see it as taking without permission, especially since he had already taken a couple of pieces.\n\nBut is he wrong? Well, maybe he could have checked with her before ordering if she wanted a specific kind. But she did say she'd have some of whatever he got. So maybe she expected it to be shared. But when she took toppings off all pieces, that affected the remaining pizza he was going to eat. He might be in the right because she altered his food without consent. However, maybe he could have communicated better after she took the toppings. Getting angry over it might be overreacting, but the situation is a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust the pizza since it was shared, but the author could see it as taking without asking. The question is whether his anger was justified. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but maybe he's not entirely. It depends on how they handle shared resources and communication in the relationship. If the pizza was his, then she shouldn't have changed it. But if it's shared, maybe some flexibility is expected. But the way he reacted by calling her selfish and escalating the argument might be his fault. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he overreacted, but there's some nuance. Wait, but the situation is that she took toppings off all the pieces, which he paid for, and he had a right to be upset. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. But the core issue is about not communicating and taking without asking. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because she did take without permission, but his reaction could have been better. However, the initial act of getting angry is the question. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she did something inconsiderate without asking, and he's justified in being upset. But others might see it as a minor issue. I need to decide based on the analysis. The user said they think the author is in the wrong, but the answer might actually be B because the actions of the girlfriend were inconsiderate. So the author's anger is justified, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
