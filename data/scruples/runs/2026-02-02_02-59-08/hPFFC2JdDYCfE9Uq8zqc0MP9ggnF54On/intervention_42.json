It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They offered their girlfriend a piece, which she declined and said she'd take some of what he gets. \n\nHe ordered, ate two pieces, and went back to watch TV. The girlfriend stayed in the kitchen longer. Later, he notices she took toppings and cheese off every piece, leaving it uneaten. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but is that accurate? Let's consider both sides. The author's perspective: he paid for the pizza, wanted to eat it as is, and found it altered without his consent. He felt disrespected. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: she didn't take a whole piece, just some toppings, and didn't see the issue since he already had his share. She might have thought she was being considerate by not taking a full slice but then modifying the remaining ones.\n\nIs the author overreacting? It's possible. The pizza was expensive, and he might have felt it was a personal purchase. However, sharing food can be an unspoken agreement, and altering it without asking might be inconsiderate. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author had a right to be angry. If the girlfriend took the remaining pizza without consent, even just toppings, it's a breach of trust. However, the argument's escalation might have been his fault if he didn't communicate his expectations beforehand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend thought it was okay to take some toppings since she wasn't eating the whole pizza. The author didn't specify that the pizza was for both, so maybe he's assuming she should have asked. \n\nBut in the initial interaction, he offered her a piece, and she said she'd take some of what he gets. If he then eats his own pieces and leaves the rest, she might have thought she could take parts of the remaining ones. However, modifying every piece's toppings is a problem because it ruins the pizza for him.\n\nSo, the author's anger is about the pizza being altered without consent, which is valid if they had an unspoken agreement to share. However, maybe he shouldn't have left the pizza unguarded, or he should have communicated that he wanted to eat it as ordered. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response (calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion) might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. He could have expressed his concern without attacking her. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, both have some responsibility. The author's anger is justified if the pizza was meant to be shared, but his reaction might be harsh. The girlfriend altering the pizza without asking is also inconsiderate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the user says the author is in the wrong, it's because he overreacted. But if the author felt entitled to the pizza as his own purchase, his reaction isn't entirely unfounded. But in a relationship, sharing and communication are key. The author didn't clarify that the pizza was for both, so maybe he's at fault for not setting boundaries. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend should have asked before altering the pizza. Given that, the argument is a two-way issue, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If he didn't communicate that the pizza was for both, he might be partially at fault. However, the act of modifying the pizza without consent is still problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but his response was excessive. However, the initial act of altering the pizza without asking is on the girlfriend. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the main issue was the girlfriend's action, but his reaction was also problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the main fault lies with him. Since he ordered the pizza, perhaps he should have considered sharing or communicating better, but the girlfriend's action was the direct cause. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is B because the author isn't entirely at fault; the main issue is the girlfriend's inconsiderate action. But the author's overreaction does contribute. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the assistant is to decide, it's possible the answer is A or B. Given that the girlfriend's action was the main issue, but the author's response was also a problem, but the question is about the author's fault. I think the answer is B because the author's anger is somewhat justified given the situation, though his approach was poor. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
