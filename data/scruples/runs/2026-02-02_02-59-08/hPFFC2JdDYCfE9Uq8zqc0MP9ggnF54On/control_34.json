It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who started the fight over pizza is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ordered pizza for themselves, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, she said no but would have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. She was in the kitchen for a while, and when he checked, she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they fought. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points here are communication and assumptions. The author assumed that when his girlfriend said she didn't want anything, she meant she didn't want a whole piece, maybe just a topping or two. But she actually went ahead and took toppings off all the pieces, which he found inconsiderate. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he explicitly asked her if she wanted something and she said no, so he probably thought the pizza was his. When she modified all the pieces, he saw that as taking without asking and being selfish. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that since he ordered it and ate first, she could take what she wanted from the remaining pizza. She might not have realized that he expected her to ask or that she was affecting his meal.\n\nBut let's look at the details. The author asked her if she wanted anything, she said no, so he ordered. Then, when she took toppings off all the pieces, he didn't know about it until later. The problem here is that she took action without communicating her needs. Even if he assumed she just wanted some toppings, she didn't need to take chunks from every piece. That's probably why he felt wronged. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have communicated better. When she first said she didn't want anything, he might not have clarified that if she wanted any part of the pizza, she should ask. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not setting clear expectations. But the girlfriend also took it upon herself to alter the pizza without asking, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose actions were more inconsiderate. The girlfriend took the toppings without asking, which could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since she had agreed earlier that she didn't want anything. However, the author might have been wrong to assume she wouldn't take anything, and maybe he should have offered sharing the pizza from the start. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author ordered the pizza because he was starving, and the girlfriend didn't ask for anything. So when she went to take the toppings, she might have thought it was okay since he had already eaten. However, modifying all the pieces could still be considered inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame, but the main issue is the lack of communication. The author could have clarified that if she wanted any part, she needed to ask, and the girlfriend could have communicated her needs instead of taking. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all pieces without consent is more of a problem. \n\nSo, the author's anger might be justified because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. But the author could have handled it differently, maybe by talking about it calmly instead of calling her names. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend took the toppings without permission and the author's reaction was to call her selfish, it's a bit of a mutual problem. But in terms of who started the fight, the author did, by getting angry first. But the girlfriend's actions might have been the catalyst. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is that the girlfriend took the pizza without asking, which is inconsiderate. The author's anger is a reaction to her inconsiderate action. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but maybe his response (calling her selfish and acting like a child) was harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were indeed selfish, then the author's anger is justified. \n\nBut the answer options are A for Yes (author in wrong) and B for No. Considering that the author asked and she said no, then she took without asking, the author's reaction is more about her action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the girlfriend is. So the answer would be B.\n"
