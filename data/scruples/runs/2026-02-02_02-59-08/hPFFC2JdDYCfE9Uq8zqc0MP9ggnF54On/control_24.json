It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the pizza story is in the wrong. So, first, what happened here? The author ordered an expensive pizza they really wanted. They told their girlfriend they were getting pizza and offered her some. She said she'd have some of whatever they got. He ordered, ate two pieces, went to watch TV. GF was in the kitchen for a while, then came back without eating. When he checked the kitchen, he found that she had taken toppings and cheese off every single piece.\n\nHe got angry, called her selfish, and they argued. The GF said she just took a little and didn't take all the cheese, implying she was fine eating it. The author is asking if his anger was justified.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the GF overstep? The author paid for the pizza, ordered it because they both wanted to eat. However, the GF was in the kitchen for a while, didn't take any pizza when she said she would. Then took toppings off all the remaining pizza, leaving it inedible for the author. The author felt this was selfish and inconsiderate. The GF defended her actions, saying it's still edible and the author is overreacting.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the GF did take from the pizza without considering that the author paid for it and wanted it. However, the author ordered the pizza with the intention to share, but the GF didn't eat any initially. The author ate two pieces first. Then the GF took toppings off all the remaining pieces. The author's anger comes from feeling that the GF was being selfish and destroying the food they paid for. The GF's response was dismissive, which led to the argument.\n\nSo, in terms of fault: The author might have been a bit over the top in calling the GF selfish, but the GF's action of ruining the pizza the author paid for is definitely inconsiderate. The GF didn't communicate her needs, just took what she wanted and left it inedible. The author's anger is about their shared resource being wasted. The GF taking toppings off all the pizza without consideration is the main issue here. The author isn't wrong in feeling that was selfish. However, maybe the way they expressed their anger could have been better. But the core issue is the GF's action, not the author's anger towards it. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
