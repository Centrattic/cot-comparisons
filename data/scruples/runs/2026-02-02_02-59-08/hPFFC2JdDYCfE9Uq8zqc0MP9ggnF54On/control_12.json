It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered a specific, more expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no, just some of whatever he gets. He orders it, eats two pieces, and then when he checks the kitchen, he finds she took toppings off every piece. He gets angry, calls her selfish, and they argue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that they paid for the pizza, so the girlfriend taking toppings without asking seems inconsiderate. But the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already taken his pieces, the leftovers were fair game. She might not have realized how much he wanted the toppings or that he expected the pizza to stay whole. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author clearly communicate his expectations? The author asked if she wanted anything, and she declined. Maybe he should have specified that he wanted the leftovers to remain intact. On the other hand, she might have assumed that the pizza was ordered for both of them, so she had the right to take what she wanted. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion\u2014could be seen as the problem. Even if her actions were inconsiderate, responding with anger and name-calling might escalate the situation. The argument brought up other issues, which suggests that this might be a pattern in their relationship rather than just a one-time event. \n\nBut the author's main point is that the girlfriend took chunks of cheese and toppings off every piece, which he found selfish. If he values the toppings that much, maybe he should have ordered separate toppings or specified that he didn't want her messing with the pizza. However, her taking some toppings isn't the same as taking all of them. She left some, so maybe the author's reaction was a bit strong. \n\nI think the fault here is shared. The author didn't set clear boundaries about how the pizza should be handled, and the girlfriend took more than she probably should have without considering his preferences. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and escalating into a big argument might make him partially at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend did take the toppings without asking, the author's anger is somewhat justified, but his response was harsh. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. He ordered the pizza for both, but when someone takes from the shared food in a way that affects the other person's enjoyment, that's a valid issue. However, the way he reacted (name-calling) is a problem. So perhaps he's in the wrong for overreacting, but the situation is a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlternatively, since the girlfriend took the toppings without asking, she's at fault, making the author not wrong for getting angry. But if the author's response was disproportionate, then he's partially at fault. The answer depends on whether the anger is justified. Since the girlfriend did take from the pizza in a way that the author disliked, the author's anger isn't entirely out of line, but his method of handling it (calling her selfish) is. \n\nHmm. The question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response is also problematic. However, the question is about if the author is in the wrong. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend did take his pizza without permission. But the way he reacted might be an issue. In AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is in the wrong for overreacting. The author's anger is about the girlfriend's action, but if he didn't set clear expectations, then he shares some blame. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's action was indeed inconsiderate. The author has a right to be upset about his pizza being altered without asking. However, the way he expressed his anger could be better handled. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it perfectly. So the author isn't wrong for being upset, but maybe the way he handled it is an issue. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong, not if his approach was ideal. So the answer might be B.\n"
