She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nSo, the situation is: The author was really craving pizza from a specific, more expensive place. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted any, and she said she'd have some of whatever they got. The author ordered, ate two pieces, then went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long time. When she came back, she didn't eat any, but later the author found out she had taken toppings and cheese off every pizza piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. They ordered the pizza because they were starving. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever they got. The author didn't explicitly offer her her own portion, but the girlfriend assumed she could take from the ordered pizza. However, when the author went to the kitchen, they found that she had taken toppings off all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate because they thought she meant to take some toppings off a couple of pieces, not every single one. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend might have thought that since she was sharing the order, she could take what she wanted from the existing pizza. The author, on the other hand, expected that if she wanted to adjust the pizza, she would do so before it was eaten, or at least not take from all the pieces after he had already eaten some. The author's anger might stem from feeling that the action was wasteful or inconsiderate, given the pizza was expensive and they both shared the cost, perhaps.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend was confused why the author was angry, thinking she was allowed to take from the pizza. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting if the girlfriend was just trying to get the toppings she wanted without considering the author's preferences. However, if the author had specific preferences about how the pizza should be eaten (like not wanting the toppings removed), and the girlfriend didn't communicate her needs beforehand, then the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nAnother angle is about shared resources. Since the pizza was ordered together, even if the author ate first, the girlfriend might feel entitled to take from what's left. But removing toppings from all pieces could be seen as ruining what the author wanted. The cost aspect is also a factor\u2014expensive pizza makes the author value it more, so wasting parts of it might be more frustrating.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to call the girlfriend selfish and start a fight. That's where the conflict escalated. The girlfriend might not have intended to be selfish; she might have just wanted to eat the toppings she liked without finishing an entire slice. The author's use of harsh language (\"fucking\", \"selfish\", \"inconsiderate\") and bringing up past arguments could be seen as the initial escalation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend took from the pizza without considering the author's preferences, but the author's reaction was overly aggressive and confrontational, then the author could be at fault for how they handled the situation. However, if the girlfriend's actions were indeed inconsiderate (removing toppings from all pieces, making the pizza less enjoyable for the author), then the author's frustration is valid, but their method of addressing it might be too harsh.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when people share an order, they usually respect each other's preferences. If the girlfriend wanted a different preparation, she should have communicated that before eating. The author might have assumed she would take what he ordered, but if her preferences differ, she should have ordered her own. Alternatively, the author could have ordered two different types. The lack of communication from both sides might be the root issue here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for being upset about the inconsiderate action, but their reaction (calling the girlfriend selfish and escalating into a fight) could be seen as their fault. So, the answer might be a mix, but since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, if the main issue is how they reacted rather than the actual act of being upset, then answer A (Yes) might be appropriate. But if the author's frustration is justified, then B (No). Given the details, it's a bit of both, but the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight. Since the fight started when the author confronted the girlfriend aggressively, the answer could lean towards A. However, if the author's anger was a reasonable response, then B. Need to decide based on typical AITA standards where the person's actions (starting the fight) are judged. The author did start the fight by being angry and calling the girlfriend names, so perhaps A is correct here.\n"
