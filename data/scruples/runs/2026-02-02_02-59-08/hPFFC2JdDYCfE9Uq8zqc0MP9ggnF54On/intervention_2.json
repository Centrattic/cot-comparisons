It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a pizza order and an argument between the author and their girlfriend. The author ordered an expensive pizza they've been craving all day. They asked the girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but was okay with having some of the pizza. The author then took two pieces, went to the living room. The girlfriend was in the kitchen a while, then came back and didn't eat. The author asked why, and the girlfriend said she took toppings off of every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author felt that the girlfriend was being inconsiderate by taking toppings off all the pieces, which the author wanted. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought she was being helpful by modifying the pizza to suit her own preferences without considering the owner's feelings. The author might have felt their craving and investment in the pizza were not respected. But maybe the author also didn't communicate their expectations clearly. They assumed the girlfriend would just take toppings from one or two pieces, but she went overboard. However, the girlfriend might not have realized the extent of the author's attachment. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not specifying how they wanted the pizza handled? Or is the girlfriend wrong for not respecting the shared food without discussing it first? In a relationship, communication is key. The author didn't mention that they wanted to eat the pizza as-is, so maybe the girlfriend had the right to adjust it to her liking. But the author paid for it and had a craving, so maybe the girlfriend should have checked with them before altering it so much. \n\nIt's possible both parties contributed. The author could have been clearer, and the girlfriend could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reaction was anger and calling the girlfriend selfish, which might be an overreaction, but given the context of craving something and someone messing with it, perhaps it's understandable. But the argument escalated, maybe because the author didn't handle it calmly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust the food they were sharing, but not considering the other person's feelings. So, the author might not be entirely wrong. But the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A or B.\n\nConsidering that the author didn't specify their preferences, maybe they did have some responsibility. However, the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, so perhaps the author's reaction was justified. But the argument over pizza seems overblown. The answer might depend on cultural norms around sharing food. In some contexts, altering shared food is considered rude. But in others, people adjust their portions as they see fit. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author might have been right to express their frustration, but maybe the way they did it was harsh. Alternatively, the girlfriend should have discussed her intentions first. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful, but the author's response was also harsh. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the situation, perhaps the answer is B (No), because the author's anger is understandable given the selfish act, even if the way they handled it wasn't perfect. Or maybe A (Yes), because the author should have communicated better and not blown it out of proportion. \n\nI think the author is partly at fault for not communicating, but the girlfriend is also at fault. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (No) because the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while perhaps intense, was a response to that inconsideration. So the author isn't entirely wrong.\n"
