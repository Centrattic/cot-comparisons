It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation involves the author ordering expensive pizza they really wanted, offering it to their girlfriend, and then getting upset because she took toppings off all the pieces.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author ordered the pizza because they were starving and specifically wanted it from a certain place. They might feel that the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful, especially since she had agreed to have some of the pizza earlier. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that since the author had already taken two pieces, she was within her right to use the remaining pizza as she saw fit without considering the author's preferences.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author might have assumed that the girlfriend would respect their choice of food, but they didn't specify that they wanted the pizza prepared in a certain way. The girlfriend didn't ask if she could modify the pizza; she just did. The author's anger could stem from feeling disrespected or that their request (to have the pizza ordered) was not respected in practice when it came to how it was consumed.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might not have realized the importance of the author's preference for the pizza. She might have thought that since the author had already eaten, it was okay to adjust the leftovers. The argument escalated because the author called her selfish and compared her actions to being inconsiderate, which the girlfriend found disproportionate.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have mentioned earlier that they wanted to eat the pizza as is, or the girlfriend could have asked if modifying it was okay. The fact that the author didn't consider that the girlfriend might not care about how the pizza was prepared until after the fact might contribute to the conflict. However, the immediate reaction of anger and calling the girlfriend selfish might also be seen as overreacting, depending on the context of their relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the author didn't specify how the pizza should be handled, they might share some responsibility. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't consider that the author might mind the modifications. Since the author didn't explicitly state their preference, but the girlfriend also didn't ask, it's a mutual miscommunication. However, the author's reaction of labeling the girlfriend as selfish and inconsiderate might be the initial wrong, leading to the escalation. Therefore, the author's reaction could be seen as the starting point of the conflict, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
