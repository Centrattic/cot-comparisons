It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The scenario is that the author ordered expensive pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out his girlfriend took toppings off all the remaining pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that sharing pizza is a given, especially since the girlfriend initially said she wanted some. However, she later took toppings off all the pieces instead of just taking a piece or some toppings. The author got upset because he thought she was being selfish, while she didn't see the issue.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the key points are communication and expectations. The author asked if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of what he got. Maybe he expected her to take a whole piece or just a bit, but she took toppings off all pieces. Did he clarify that each piece was his own? The problem might be that there was a misunderstanding. The author might have assumed that she would take a piece, but she did something else. However, is it reasonable to get angry over that? Also, the argument escalated into name-calling and bringing up other issues, which is a red flag. Even if the initial issue is minor, the way the conflict was handled matters. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which might be an overreaction. The girlfriend's response was defensive, but did the author have a right to be angry?\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. The author didn't specify that the pizza was ordered for both of them. If he ordered it for himself, then the girlfriend taking toppings from the remaining pieces might be expected. But if he ordered it intending to share, then her actions were inconsiderate. However, the problem is that the author didn't clearly communicate his expectations. Maybe the girlfriend thought she could take toppings as she liked, while he thought she'd take a piece. Additionally, the author's reaction was harsh, which could be the root of the problem. Getting angry and calling her names escalated the situation. So, even if there's a valid point about sharing, the way he handled it might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the escalation and lack of communication.\n"
