It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, the author ordered a specific, expensive pizza they were craving. They offered their girlfriend a piece, which she declined, but later took toppings off every slice. When confronted, she was confused and called him a child. The argument escalated.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about expectations and communication. The author expected their girlfriend to either take a piece or not touch the pizza, but she did something in between\u2014taking toppings off all slices. The author felt this was selfish and inconsiderate, especially since they paid for it. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being helpful by saving money by not buying her own pizza and just modifying the existing slices. She didn't take the whole pizza, just parts, and maybe she didn't realize how the author would feel about it. \n\nThe author got angry and called her selfish, which led to a big argument. But is the anger justified? Well, it's their purchase, so they might feel entitled to not have it altered without consent. However, the reaction could be seen as over the top since the modifications didn't make the pizza inedible. \n\nThe girlfriend's confusion and the argument about being a child might indicate that she didn't intend to cause harm. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe the way they handled it was the issue. Instead of calling her selfish, maybe discussing the situation calmly would have been better. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did start the fight by reacting strongly. While the action of taking toppings off might be inconsiderate, the author's response of calling the girlfriend selfish and escalating to a big argument could be seen as disproportionate. The blame might be shared, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they initiated the conflict with their strong reaction, maybe they are. But if the girlfriend's action was indeed selfish, then the author's anger might be justified. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, in relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't clarify their expectations beforehand, that's part of the problem. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they could have handled it better without escalating. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's action was disrespectful. Hmm.\n"
