It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The story is that the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. The girlfriend said she would just have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the points. The author ordered a specific type of pizza he really wanted. The girlfriend said she wanted some of it but didn't take a whole piece. The author assumed she took toppings off a couple of pieces, but she actually did it to all of them. He got angry because she modified all the pizza, and she was confused and defensive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. I need to decide if it's A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He paid for the pizza, it's a place he likes, and he was expecting to eat it himself. The girlfriend didn't eat when he asked if she wanted something. Then, when he came back, she had altered all the remaining pizza, which he found frustrating. He might feel like she didn't respect his choice or his money, especially since it's a more expensive spot. \n\nFrom her perspective: She didn't take a whole piece, just the toppings. She might have thought it was okay since he had already taken his share. She was confused why he was angry, maybe feeling he overreacted. She also defended herself by saying he was acting like a child.\n\nKey points to consider: Communication was an issue. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza to remain whole. She didn't clarify her intent beyond taking toppings. Maybe the fight could have been avoided if they discussed expectations beforehand. However, she did alter all the pizza, which might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since he paid for it and had a specific craving. \n\nIs it a matter of overreacting? The author could have handled it differently, like talking calmly instead of calling her selfish. But her actions might have been inconsiderate. The argument escalated quickly, and both might have contributed. However, the core issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both are at least a little wrong. But the question is specifically about the author. If the author's anger was disproportionate, maybe he's wrong. If her actions were inconsiderate and he's justified in feeling upset, then he's not wrong. \n\nGiven that she modified all the pizza, which he had paid for and craved, his reaction might be seen as valid. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish, escalating to arguments) could make him at fault. But the initial act of taking toppings off all the pieces without discussing could be the main issue. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) because her action might be seen as inconsiderate, and he had a right to be upset. However, his approach could have been better. But the question is about who is in the wrong in the situation. Since she did something that affected his purchase and he had a right to be upset, maybe he's not wrong. But if his reaction was too harsh, then A. The problem is in the interpretation. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads, people often look for whether the reaction is disproportionate. Here, the author got angry over someone altering his food without discussion, which might be seen as a reasonable response. So B (not in the wrong). But some might say he's wrong for overreacting. It's a bit of a toss-up. But considering the girlfriend's actions, maybe B is correct.\n"
