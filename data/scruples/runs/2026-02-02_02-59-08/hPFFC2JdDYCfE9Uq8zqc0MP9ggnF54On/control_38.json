It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in a situation where they got into a fight over pizza with their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted. The girlfriend said she'd have some of whatever he got, so he ordered it. He ate two pieces, then went to the kitchen and found she had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend thought she could take what she wanted, while the author expected her to take maybe a couple of pieces. She ended up modifying all the pieces, which the author found frustrating. \n\nWas the author wrong to get angry? Well, he had asked her if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of his order. Maybe he should have clarified that he wanted to eat it himself, but he did ask and she said no. Then when she took the toppings off all the pieces, that's a problem because he can't eat them as he wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more considerate. If she wanted some of the toppings, maybe she should have asked or taken just a few pieces. But she took from all of them, which ruined his pizza. \n\nThe author called her selfish, which might be harsh, but his reaction was because his meal was compromised. She thought it was fine and didn't take all the cheese, but the author was left with a pizza that wasn't as he ordered. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? It's a communication issue. The author might have assumed she'd take a couple of pieces, but she took from all. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. However, the author did order the pizza himself, which was a shared expense? Wait, the context says he ordered it because he was starving, and the girlfriend said she'd have some of what he got. So the pizza was his order, but she was part of the cost? If so, maybe she had a right to take some. But if she took all the toppings, that's taking more than her share. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have been more considerate when he ordered the pizza knowing she might want part of it. But he did ask her. \n\nSo, in terms of blame, both have some responsibility. The author for not maybe ordering a second pizza or communicating better, and the girlfriend for taking all the toppings without considering his preference. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might be B (No), because the author's anger is a reaction to his meal being altered without his consent. However, the argument escalated in a way that might have been unproductive, but the initial action of the girlfriend was inconsiderate. So maybe the author isn't wrong for being upset, but the way the argument went might be his fault. But the question is specifically about starting the fight. The author \"started\" the fight by getting angry. But was he wrong to be angry? If the girlfriend did something that ruined his meal, then he's not wrong. So B.\n"
