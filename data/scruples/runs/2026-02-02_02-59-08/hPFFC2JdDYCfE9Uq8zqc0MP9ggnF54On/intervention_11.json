It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza, took two pieces, and when they went to the kitchen, they found their girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was clear they were starving and ordered pizza, offering to get her something. She said she'd have some of what they got. Then, when he went to the kitchen, he found the pizza altered in a way he didn't expect. He was upset because she didn't take just a bit, but modified all the pieces. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was okay to take some toppings because she didn't want a whole slice. Maybe she didn't realize how much he'd be affected by the changes. She might have seen it as a small action, not considering his feelings about the pizza he paid for. \n\nThe author's reaction was to call her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The key here is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Pizza is a minor thing, so getting angry over it could be seen as overreacting. However, if the girlfriend's actions were disrespectful or wasteful, maybe the author had a point.\n\nBut the author did order the pizza, and if they had communicated better, maybe the situation could have been avoided. The author didn't check if she wanted a specific type or if she wanted to share the pizza differently. The girlfriend might have thought she could do what she wanted with the leftovers, not realizing it was important to him. \n\nSo, the author's mistake could be in not setting boundaries or discussing the pizza order more clearly. Also, calling her selfish might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The girlfriend's confusion suggests she didn't see the problem, so the author's anger might have been more about unmet expectations rather than a justified grievance. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who reacts with anger over something trivial is considered at fault unless there's a deeper issue. Here, since pizza is a small matter and the argument led to bringing up other issues, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. However, if the act of modifying all the pizza pieces without consent is a deal-breaker, maybe not. \n\nBut typically, these situations are about communication and expectations. The author didn't clarify how they wanted the pizza handled, and the girlfriend might have had no idea that taking toppings off would be a problem. So the author's responsibility was to set those expectations, and failing to do so led to the conflict. Hence, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
