It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. From the situation described, the author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and left the rest. The girlfriend took toppings off every piece, not just one or two. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they fought.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend said she wanted some toppings but didn't specify how much. The author assumed she'd take a few pieces, but she took from all of them. The author's anger stems from feeling that the girlfriend was inconsiderate by not leaving some whole pieces. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't see it as a big deal and thought the author was overreacting.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author might not be entirely wrong for being upset. If you order pizza expecting to share, and someone takes from all the slices, leaving none intact, that could feel disrespectful. The girlfriend didn't communicate her needs clearly and didn't consider that the author might want some whole slices. However, the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion\u2014could be seen as harsh. The argument escalated into a bigger fight, bringing up other issues, which complicates things.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong for getting angry? Maybe not entirely. It's about differing expectations. The author thought he could have two pieces and the rest would be shared, but the girlfriend's actions didn't align with that. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish, starting a fight) might have been the wrong approach. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response might have been excessive. So, it's a mix. The author's anger isn't unjustified, but his handling of it could be seen as the problem. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he overreacted, but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was clearly inconsiderate, then the author might not be in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
