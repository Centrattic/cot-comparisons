It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza, ate two pieces, and then found out their girlfriend had taken toppings off every piece. They got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the perspectives of both people here. The author thought the girlfriend wanted to eat some of the pizza, maybe taking toppings off just a couple pieces. But she took from every piece, which the author found inconsiderate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she could do that without affecting the author, especially since they had already eaten two pieces.\n\nThe author's anger seems to stem from feeling that the girlfriend didn't consider their feelings or the effort of getting the pizza. But maybe the girlfriend didn't realize how much the author was invested in the pizza. The author mentions it was expensive and they were really craving it. So, maybe the argument was over a small thing, but the author's reaction was strong.\n\nI should think about communication here. The author asked the girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of what the author gets. But maybe the author didn't clarify that they wanted the pizza to stay intact, or the girlfriend didn't specify that she wanted to take toppings off. Both might have had different expectations. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response was defensive, calling the author a child. That's probably not helpful. But the author's reaction of calling her selfish and blowing things out of proportion might be overreacting. Even if the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, is that really that bad? The author was left with cheese chunks, but the girlfriend didn't take the whole pizza. \n\nSo, the key here is whether the author's anger was justified. If the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces, maybe the author felt like the pizza wasn't enjoyable anymore. But it's still edible, as the girlfriend said. The argument might have been avoidable if they had communicated better. However, the author's reaction leading to a big fight over something relatively minor could be seen as their fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't consider that the author might not want her messing with the pizza. She assumed she could take toppings off without affecting him. Maybe both sides have some responsibility here. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the author's anger was disproportionate. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because getting angry over toppings being taken, even if it's not the end of the world, might be an overreaction. The girlfriend didn't take all the pizza, just modified it, and the author could have addressed it calmly instead of escalating. So, maybe the author is at fault for not handling it better.\n"
