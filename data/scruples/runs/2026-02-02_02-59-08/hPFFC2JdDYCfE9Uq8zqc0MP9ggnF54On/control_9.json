It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a pizza order. The author was really craving pizza from a specific place, which is more expensive but worth it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said no but would have some of what they got. Then the author orders it, eats two pieces, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while. When she comes back, she hasn't eaten, and the author finds out she took toppings and cheese off all the pizza pieces in the kitchen. The argument ensues because the author feels she was selfish and inconsiderate, and the girlfriend says the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author ordered the pizza, but the girlfriend said she wanted some. However, she ended up taking toppings from every piece, which the author found offensive. The girlfriend didn't eat any of the pizza they had ordered, but modified all the pieces. The author's anger is about the girlfriend using the pizza they had ordered without considering their own need to eat it. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thought it was fine because the author had already eaten two pieces.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when someone orders food, especially when they've paid for it, there's an expectation that the food is for both to share. The girlfriend's action of taking toppings off all the pizza pieces in the kitchen might have been an attempt to eat it in a way that suited her, but she didn't communicate this to the author. The author might feel that their effort to share was disregarded. However, the girlfriend might have thought that since the author had already had two pieces, she could adjust the remaining pizza as she saw fit. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author ordered the pizza, but the girlfriend said she wanted some. If she wanted to eat it, she should have done so without altering the pizza in a way that makes it less edible for the author. Taking toppings off all pieces might have been a selfish act because it left the author with pizza that's not as they wanted. The girlfriend's explanation that she didn't take all the cheese and it's still fine is subjective. What's acceptable to her might not be acceptable to the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to call their girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the argument. The girlfriend might feel that the author overreacted because she didn't take all the pizza, just modified it. But the act of modifying all the pieces without discussing it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose actions were more inconsiderate. The author ordered pizza for both, the girlfriend said she wanted some but then altered all the pieces, making them less desirable for the author. The author's anger stems from feeling that their contribution (paying for the pizza) was disregarded. However, the girlfriend might have thought she was allowed to adjust the leftovers as she saw fit. \n\nBut in a relationship, communication is key. If the girlfriend wanted to eat the pizza in a different way, she could have discussed it with the author instead of modifying all the pieces. The author's frustration is valid because their meal was altered without their consent. However, the anger might be disproportionate if the pizza is still edible. \n\nThe girlfriend's act of taking toppings from every piece is more about self-interest without considering the other person's preferences. Even if the author had two pieces, the remaining pizza is for both. By changing all the pieces, she made it less usable for the author. Therefore, the author's reaction is based on a valid grievance. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of calling the author a child for overreacting might be more inconsiderate. The author's anger isn't over something trivial\u2014it's about respect for shared resources and communication. The girlfriend's actions set a precedent for selfish behavior, which the author is justified in addressing. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
