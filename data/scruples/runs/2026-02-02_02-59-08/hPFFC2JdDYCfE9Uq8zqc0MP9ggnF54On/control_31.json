It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author (or the person in the story) was really craving pizza from a specific, more expensive place. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she just wanted some of the toppings from whatever they ordered. The author orders the pizza, takes two slices, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when the author checks, they find she's removed toppings and cheese from every slice. The author gets angry, calls her selfish, and a big argument ensues. The girlfriend is confused and says the author is acting like a child.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, expectations, and how they handled the situation. The author assumed the girlfriend meant taking toppings off one or two pieces, but she actually did it to all. The author ordered the pizza for both of them, expecting to share. The girlfriend's action of removing toppings from every slice might seem excessive. But was the author right to get angry and start a fight?\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't clarify what the girlfriend meant by \"some of the toppings.\" Maybe they should have asked for specifics. But on the other hand, the girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza could be seen as inconsiderate. The author paid for it, was looking forward to it, and now the pizza is ruined. The response of the girlfriend downplaying the situation and calling the author a child is also problematic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe they could have been clearer about their expectations. But the girlfriend's actions were definitely selfish, and the author's anger isn't entirely unreasonable. The fight probably wasn't the best approach, but the root of the problem was the girlfriend's behavior. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
