It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.

She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and their girlfriend. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author ordered pizza from a specific place because they were craving it, even though it's a bit more expensive. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever they get. The author then orders it, eats two slices, and goes to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, the author notices she didn't eat. She explains that she took toppings and cheese off all the pieces. \n\nThe author is upset because they thought she just took a little from a couple of slices, but instead she did this to every piece. The girlfriend defended her actions by saying the author already had their pieces and that she didn't take all the cheese. She also got annoyed when the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is wrong. The main issue is the reaction to the girlfriend's actions. The girlfriend took toppings and cheese off all the pizza slices. The author ordered the pizza for themselves, and even though they asked the girlfriend if she wanted something, she said \"some of whatever\" they get. By taking toppings off every piece, she made the remaining pizza less desirable for the author, who was the one who ordered it. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, this could be seen as selfish because the pizza was ordered for both of them, and she altered it in a way that affects the author's enjoyment. However, the girlfriend's reasoning is that she only took some toppings and didn't take all, so the pizza is still edible. She also points out that the author had already eaten two slices, implying that she had the right to take some from the remaining slices.\n\nThe key here is about shared expectations. When the author asked if the girlfriend wanted something, she agreed to have some of whatever they get. The author might have expected her to take a slice or maybe a few toppings, but she took from all pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. However, the girlfriend might not have realized how much of an issue it would be, thinking that taking some toppings was fine.\n\nThe argument escalated when the author called her selfish and inconsiderate, which could be seen as a harsh reaction. But considering the girlfriend altered the shared food in a way that affects the author's meal, the author's frustration might be understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have considered that the girlfriend might have different preferences and perhaps not ordered the pizza for her if she didn't want it. However, the author did ask if she wanted something, so there was an expectation of sharing. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting because it's just pizza, but the girlfriend's actions did affect the author's enjoyment. The girlfriend's response of being annoyed and calling the author a child for blowing it out of proportion might indicate she didn't see the problem. \n\nIn terms of who is wrong, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation by calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which could be seen as a harsh response. However, the girlfriend's actions did impact the author's meal, so her behavior could be inconsiderate. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether their anger is justified. If the author had communicated better, like specifying they wanted to keep the pizza as is, then the girlfriend's actions might be more problematic. But since the author ordered the pizza with the understanding that the girlfriend would have some, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all pieces is inconsiderate. However, the author's reaction of calling her selfish and inconsiderate might be too strong, leading to the argument. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for overreacting, but the girlfriend's actions are also inconsiderate. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Given that, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, even if the author's reaction could have been calmer. Alternatively, the author's response might be seen as justified given the selfishness of taking toppings from all slices. It's a tough call, but considering the girlfriend altered shared food without considering the author's preferences, the author's anger is somewhat justified, so they might not be in the wrong. Hence, answer B.\n"
