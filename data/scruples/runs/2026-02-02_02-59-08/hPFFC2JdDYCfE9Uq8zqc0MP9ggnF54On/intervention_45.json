It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. The situation is that the author ordered pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd just have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, ate two pieces, and when he went to the kitchen, he found that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author ordered the pizza because it's a place they both know is better but more expensive. The girlfriend agreed to have some of what he ordered, so he assumed she would take a few pieces or maybe take some toppings off a couple. However, she took toppings and cheese off every single piece. The author then got upset, called her selfish, and there was a big argument.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective is that he paid for the pizza as a treat, expecting that the girlfriend would take a reasonable amount. Her action of removing toppings from all pieces might have been seen as taking the pizza he ordered without considering his enjoyment. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might have thought she was just using what was there, especially since he had already eaten two pieces. She might not have realized that removing toppings from all the pieces would ruin the pizza for him, making it less enjoyable or even inedible. She also mentioned it was still fine to eat, but the author's reaction was based on the fact that the pizza was a specific craving and expensive.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author did offer the pizza to his girlfriend, so there's an implicit expectation that they could share it. The girlfriend's action of removing all toppings could be seen as not respecting the author's preference or the effort he made to get the pizza. However, the author might have been too harsh in calling her selfish and inconsiderate, especially if he didn't communicate his preference for the toppings to stay. Maybe he should have discussed it before ordering or clarified his expectations. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have overstepped by taking toppings from all pieces without considering how it would affect the author's enjoyment.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and expectations. Did the author clearly state that the pizza was a specific craving and that he wanted to enjoy it as is? If not, then the girlfriend might not have realized the importance of the toppings to him. However, if the author had made that clear, then her action could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's anger might be justified if the pizza was a significant expense and a personal craving, but the way he reacted (calling her selfish and the fight escalating) might have been disproportionate.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might have set up the situation by not being clear about his expectations, but the girlfriend's action could be seen as selfish if she didn't consider his preferences. However, it's also possible that the author's reaction was overly harsh, leading to a fight over something that, while important to him, might not warrant such a strong response. The fact that they ended up arguing about other things suggests that maybe the underlying issues contributed to the conflict, not just the pizza incident.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The author did order the pizza and offered it to his girlfriend, so he might have expected her to take it in a way that allows him to enjoy the remaining pizza. Her action of taking toppings from all pieces could be seen as not respecting his desire to have the pizza as ordered. Therefore, the author's anger might be justified in that sense. However, the way he reacted (calling her selfish and the argument escalating) could be seen as the author's fault if he didn't communicate his expectations properly. It's a balance between both parties' actions. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is that he's not in the wrong because his reaction was based on the specific circumstances of the pizza being a personal craving and the girlfriend's action affecting his enjoyment. However, the way he handled the situation could have been improved. But given the scenario, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
