It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author ordered pizza because they were starving and offered their girlfriend to get something. She said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered, ate two pieces, and then found out she took toppings off every piece in the kitchen. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. The author ordered the pizza because he was really hungry. The girlfriend said she didn't want anything, but then took toppings off all the pieces. The author might feel that she was being inconsiderate because she didn't have her own pizza and instead modified the one he ordered. \n\nBut wait, the girl didn't ask for pizza initially. She said she'd just have some of what he got. However, when he ordered, she didn't clarify that she wanted to take toppings off. She did that after he had already eaten some. The author might feel that she ruined the pizza he paid for and was being selfish by not getting her own or asking first. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might think that since the pizza was already there and the author had his pieces, she was just using what was available. She didn't take all the cheese, so maybe she thought it was a reasonable way to get the toppings she wanted without ordering something else. But taking toppings off every piece is a bit excessive. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that she was using his order without consent and being selfish. But is that overreacting? It's possible. However, the girl was dismissive and called him a child, which could escalate the argument. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did ask if she wanted something, and she declined. He then ordered, assuming she was okay with what he got. But he didn't specify that he wouldn't want her to alter the pizza. The girl didn't communicate her needs before taking the toppings off. \n\nSo, both parties have some responsibility here. The author's anger might be a reaction to the unexpected behavior, and the girl's action was inconsiderate. But whether the author is in the wrong for starting the fight... Well, he did call her selfish and brought up other arguments. However, the initial action of her taking toppings without discussing it could be the root. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The girl didn't talk about her plan before altering the pizza, and the author didn't clarify his expectations. But in terms of who is more at fault, the girl's action was inconsiderate, leading the author to feel disrespected. However, the author's response might have been harsh. \n\nIn the end, maybe both have some fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for A or B, and considering the girl's actions were inconsiderate, the author's anger is justified. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
