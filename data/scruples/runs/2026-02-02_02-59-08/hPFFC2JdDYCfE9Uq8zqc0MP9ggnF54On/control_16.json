It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author ordered expensive pizza from a specific place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she declined but said she would have some of whatever he ordered. He took two pieces, left the rest for her, and when he went to get more, she had removed toppings and cheese from all the remaining pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The author assumed she would take some pieces or maybe just a little from each, but she removed toppings from all the remaining slices. The problem here is the unspoken expectations. When you share food, especially when someone else paid for it, there's an expectation of mutual respect. The girlfriend might not have realized that removing all toppings would make the remaining pizza less enjoyable for the person who ordered it. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, this act of taking the toppings off every piece could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since he was the one who paid for the meal. He might feel that she didn't consider his preference for the pizza as he ordered it. However, the girlfriend might argue that she was trying to get some toppings without eating the whole pizza, and the author overreacted by calling her selfish and blowing it out of proportion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he had the right to expect that the pizza he ordered wouldn't be altered in a way that ruined his experience. On the other hand, his reaction was to call her names and escalate into a big argument, which might be seen as disproportionate. But the root issue is the girlfriend's action, which could be seen as selfish, even if unintentionally.\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. If she wanted to take toppings, she could have asked or discussed it. But he also could have considered that maybe she didn't realize the impact. However, the act itself (removing toppings from all pieces) shows a lack of consideration. The author's anger is a reaction to that, which isn't entirely unfounded. However, his response (calling her selfish, leading to a big argument) might be over the top if he didn't communicate his feelings first.\n\nBut in terms of who started the fight, the question is if the author is in the wrong for starting it. If the girlfriend did something that was inconsiderate, then the author's anger isn't unjustified. However, how he expressed it (calling her selfish, escalating the argument) might be where he's at fault. The line is between the justification of his feelings and the appropriateness of his response.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's anger is somewhat justified due to her action, but the way he reacted might be inconsiderate. However, the main wrong here is the girlfriend's action, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong for getting upset. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
