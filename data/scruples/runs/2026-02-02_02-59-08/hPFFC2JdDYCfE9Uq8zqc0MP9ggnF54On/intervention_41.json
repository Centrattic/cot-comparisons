It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza between the author and their girlfriend. The author ordered an expensive pizza, ate two slices, and then found out later that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. They got angry and called her selfish, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably felt that the pizza was ordered with the expectation that they would share it. When they asked if she wanted anything, she said she'd just have some of whatever the author got. The author might have assumed that meant she would take a slice or two, not alter the remaining pizza. \n\nOn the girlfriend's side, maybe she didn't think about the fact that the pizza was a special order and expensive. She might have thought it was okay to take toppings since the author had already eaten their share. She might not have realized how much the author valued the pizza. However, taking toppings off every single piece seems excessive. Even if she wanted to eat some toppings, taking chunks of cheese from all slices would make the pizza less enjoyable for the author, who paid for it and was looking forward to eating the whole thing.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that the girlfriend was inconsiderate, not just taking a part but altering the pizza in a way that affects the author's enjoyment. But was getting angry over that a justified reaction? It depends on how they communicate and their usual dynamics. If the author didn't clarify the expectations beforehand, maybe they could be at fault for not setting clear terms. However, the girlfriend's action of taking from all slices seems like overstepping, especially if the author had already eaten their own portions. \n\nThe author called the girlfriend selfish and childish, which might have been harsh, but the action of altering the pizza could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend dismissing the author's feelings as overreacting might have escalated the situation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have done better to ask if she wanted to take some toppings before eating their own slices. However, the girlfriend's action in taking from all the pizza after the author had eaten their own could be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nBut then again, getting angry over something like this might be disproportionate. It's important to consider the context\u2014maybe they have other tensions. The key is whether the author's reaction was reasonable. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response of calling her selfish and escalating the argument might be where they went wrong. However, the initial action of the girlfriend could be seen as the problem. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer depends on whether the author's anger was proportionate. If the girlfriend took from the pizza without considering the author's preferences, that's on her. But if the author didn't set expectations, maybe they share some blame. However, the girlfriend's action was pretty bad\u2014removing toppings from all pieces. So maybe the author isn't wrong for being upset. But arguing over pizza is a small thing. Maybe the author's reaction was too intense. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, the author's anger and the argument might be overreacting. Alternatively, B (No) if the reaction is justified because the girlfriend's action was selfish and the author was within their right to be upset. \n\nWait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. Let me re-read the details. The author ordered the pizza, ate two slices, then the girlfriend took toppings from every piece. The author was upset because she altered the pizza, making it less enjoyable. The girlfriend didn't see the problem. The author called her selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. \n\nIn this case, the girlfriend did something that affected the author's enjoyment of their own purchase. The author's anger is because of inconsiderate action. However, getting into a big argument over this might be disproportionate. But the action itself was inconsiderate. It's possible that both are at fault for communication issues. However, the question is specifically about the author. If the author's actions (calling the girlfriend selfish, getting into an argument) were wrong, then A. If the author was justified in being upset because the girlfriend's action was wrong, then B. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from all the pizza without consideration for the author's preferences was inconsiderate, and the author's reaction, while perhaps intense, was in response to that. However, if the author's reaction was overly harsh, maybe A. But the key is the girlfriend's action was the main issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
