It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fight over pizza with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author ordered expensive pizza they really wanted, asked the girlfriend if she wanted something, and she said no but would have some of what he got. He took two pieces, went to watch TV. She was in the kitchen a while, then came back and didn't eat. He asked why, and she said she took toppings off some pieces. He thought maybe one or two, but she had taken toppings and cheese off all the pizza. He got angry, called her selfish, and they argued.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious what I think. My job is to decide A (author wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nSo, let's consider both sides. The author ordered pizza he wanted, which was a treat. He asked if she wanted some, she said no but then took parts of the pizza. The key point is whether her actions were selfish or the author was justifiably upset. She didn't take the whole pizza, just the toppings. The author might feel that since he paid for it, she shouldn't have messed with it. But she might argue that she was just using what was there, especially since he had already taken his pieces.\n\nWas the author wrong to get angry? The girlfriend did say she would have some of the pizza, but then modified the remaining pieces without communicating. The author might feel that her actions were inconsiderate because he had already taken his share, expecting the rest to be untouched. However, maybe the author could have communicated better or considered that she might want to adjust the pizza to her taste. Also, the argument escalated quickly\u2014calling her selfish and inconsiderate might have been harsh, leading to a bigger fight over something minor. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't communicate her intent to modify the pizza and might not have realized how much the author valued the pizza. But the author could have checked on the pizza or clarified if she was going to do something with it. Maybe the author overreacted by calling her names, which escalated the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have misinterpreted her initial statement, thinking she wanted a whole piece but she just wanted toppings. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay to adjust the remaining pizza since he had his own pieces. However, the author's frustration comes from feeling that she was being selfish by altering the pizza he paid for. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not setting boundaries? Maybe. He ordered the pizza for himself but expected her to have access to it. If he wanted to keep the pizza as is, he should have specified that. Alternatively, if he's okay with her adjusting it, but didn't communicate that. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of her actions. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the argument seems to be about differing expectations and communication. The author's anger might have been disproportionate, but the girlfriend could have asked first. However, the author's reaction\u2014calling her selfish and inconsiderate\u2014might have been too harsh for the situation. The fact that she was \"annoying\" him when he got angry shows that the argument might have spiraled from both sides not understanding each other's perspective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for overreacting and escalating the situation, but the girlfriend also didn't communicate her actions clearly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he started the fight by being angry over something that wasn't entirely inconsiderate (just taking toppings off the remaining pieces), he might be the one at fault. But maybe not entirely. \n\nAlternatively, since she did alter the pizza without discussing it, the author's reaction could be justified. But the way he handled it (calling her names) was probably wrong. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps both are a little at fault. However, the options are A or B. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A) but is unsure. I have to decide based on the scenario. The key points are: the author ordered expensive pizza he wanted, she said she'd have some, took toppings off all pieces. He got angry, called her selfish, leading to a big argument. \n\nI think the main issue is the communication. The author didn't specify that he wanted the pizza untouched, and she didn't ask if she could modify the remaining pieces. The act of taking toppings off isn't necessarily selfish, but the author felt it was. The argument might have been avoidable with better communication. However, the author's reaction was to call her names, which is a problem. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who reacts with anger over minor things is seen as the ass. So maybe the author is the ass for overreacting. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). But some might argue that the girlfriend was inconsiderate. However, the question is about the author's actions. Since he escalated the situation with harsh language and called her names, he's more at fault. So I'd lean towards A.\n"
