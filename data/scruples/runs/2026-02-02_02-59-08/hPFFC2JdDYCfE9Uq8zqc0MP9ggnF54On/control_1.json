It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fight over pizza. The author ordered pizza from a specific place they both like, asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever the author got. The author then ate two pieces, went to watch TV, and the girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while. When the author went to the kitchen, they found that the girlfriend had taken toppings and cheese off every piece. The author got angry, called her selfish, and they had a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they ordered the pizza, expected to share it, and when the girlfriend didn't eat her own pieces but instead messed with the remaining ones, the author felt disrespected and selfish. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might think that since she didn't eat the pizza herself, she was just taking what she wanted from the leftovers. She might not see the problem because she didn't take all of it, just some toppings and cheese.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author assumed that the pizza was for both of them to share, so when the girlfriend didn't take her own slices but altered the remaining ones, it felt like she was taking more than her share without considering the author's preferences. However, the author didn't clarify earlier that they wanted to keep the pizza as it was. Maybe the author should have specified if they wanted the pizza untouched or if they were okay with her taking toppings. The girlfriend might not have realized that altering the pizza was an issue, especially if she thought it was left over after the author had their own slices.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the author values the toppings. But if she didn't eat any of the pizza herself, maybe she felt entitled to modify the leftovers as she saw fit. The problem might be that both had different expectations about how the pizza should be shared and consumed.\n\nThe author's reaction was anger and calling the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, which escalated the situation. The girlfriend's confusion and defense might stem from not understanding why taking some toppings was a big deal. The argument then spiraled into bringing up other issues, which complicates things further.\n\nConsidering that the author didn't communicate their preference for the pizza to remain untouched, they might share some responsibility. However, the girlfriend's action of taking toppings from every piece without prior discussion could be seen as selfish. But if the author had made it clear how they wanted to share the pizza, maybe the situation would have been avoided.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The author might have been too quick to anger without addressing the issue calmly first. But the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate. However, the author's response was harsh, and they could have approached the situation differently. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not communicating their expectations, but the girlfriend's actions also contributed. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the girlfriend didn't ask or communicate her intentions, the author might not be entirely wrong. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, but the author could have handled it better. Hmm.\n"
