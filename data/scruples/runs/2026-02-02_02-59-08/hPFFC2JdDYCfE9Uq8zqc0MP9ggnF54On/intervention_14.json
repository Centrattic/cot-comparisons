It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fight over pizza. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author ordered expensive pizza because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted some, and she said she'd have some of whatever they get. The author then orders it, eats two pieces, and goes back to the living room. The girlfriend is in the kitchen for a while, and when she comes back, the author notices she didn't eat. The girlfriend says she took toppings off some pieces, but the author finds out she took toppings and cheese off every single piece. The argument ensues, with the author calling her selfish and the girlfriend saying the author is acting like a child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Hmm. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They wanted to share their pizza with their girlfriend. The girlfriend didn't eat the pizza they had ordered, even though she had agreed to have some. Instead, she took toppings off all the pieces, which the author found inconsiderate. The author felt justified in being upset because they paid for the pizza and expected to share it. They might feel that the girlfriend didn't respect their effort or the expense involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: She might feel that she was allowed to eat what she wanted. Since the author had already taken two pieces, maybe she thought the rest was fair game. She took toppings off to suit her preferences, which is common. She might not see the issue because she didn't take the entire pizza, just parts of it. Her confusion and the comment about the author being a child suggest she felt the reaction was overblown.\n\nNow, considering communication. The author asked if she wanted something, and she said she'd have some of what they get. The author ordered, and the girlfriend later took toppings off all the pieces. The author might have expected her to take a piece or two, not modify all of them. But maybe the girlfriend thought she could adjust the pizza to her taste without eating the entire thing. \n\nIs the author wrong for getting angry? Well, the argument is about sharing and respect. The girlfriend took what she wanted without considering the author's feelings. However, the author could have communicated better about not wanting her to modify all the pieces. The key points here are expectations and communication. The author might have assumed the girlfriend would eat some of the pizza as a shared meal, but the girlfriend had different preferences. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author paid for the pizza and wanted to share it. The girlfriend's action of modifying all the pizza might have been selfish, but maybe she didn't realize it would upset the author. The author's anger might be a reaction to feeling disrespected, but the argument's escalation could have been avoided with better communication. \n\nHowever, the author did call the girlfriend selfish and inconsiderate, leading to an argument. The girlfriend's response of acting like a child suggests the author overreacted. The fact that it's just pizza and the situation was blown out of proportion, as the author admits, might mean the author is in the wrong for taking it too seriously.\n\nBut another angle: if the girlfriend took toppings off all the pieces without asking, that's inconsiderate. The author had already given her the option to have some, so expecting her to not touch the rest without communication is reasonable. The girlfriend's actions might have been selfish, so the author's reaction isn't entirely unwarranted. \n\nBalancing both sides, the main issue is unmet expectations. The author didn't specify that they wanted to share the pizza as is, and the girlfriend didn't ask for permission to modify all the pieces. Both could have communicated better. However, since the girlfriend took what she wanted without considering the author's feelings, maybe she's partially at fault. But the author's harsh reaction and calling her names might make them responsible for escalating the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), it's because they overreacted. If B (no), because the girlfriend was selfish. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the situation. The key is that the girlfriend did something that the author found inconsiderate, and the argument was about that. But the author's response might have been too harsh. However, the girlfriend's action could be seen as selfish. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted and called the girlfriend names, leading to escalation. The girlfriend's action was inconsiderate, but the author's response was disproportionate. The author should have handled it more calmly. So, the answer is A.\n"
