It\u2019s a little more expensive than other places around here, but totally worth it.  I asked my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  \n\nSo I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn\u2019t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn\u2019t eating.  She said she did, she didn\u2019t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  \n\nI asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what\u2019s the big deal, she didn\u2019t take ALL the cheese off them.  It\u2019s still fine to eat.  I called her selfish and inconsiderate.  She actually got annoying with me when I did telling me I was acting like a child  blowing shit out of proportion.  We ended up in a big argument, bringing up other. \n\nI know it\u2019s just pizza and not the end of the world, but I feel like getting angry over such a display of selfishness isn\u2019t all that out of proportion.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for starting a fight over pizza. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author ordered a pizza from a specific, more expensive place because they were craving it. They asked their girlfriend if she wanted anything, and she said she'd have some of whatever he got. He ordered it, took two slices, went to watch TV. The girlfriend was in the kitchen for a while, then came back without eating. When he asked, she said she took toppings off the pieces. He went to the kitchen and found that she had removed toppings and cheese from every piece. He got angry, called her selfish and inconsiderate, and they argued.\n\nThe author feels that getting angry over her actions isn't out of proportion, but others might say it's just pizza. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Did the author do anything wrong? Well, he ordered the pizza because he wanted it. He asked her if she wanted something, which she declined. Then she ended up taking from the pizza without his knowledge. The problem here is that she altered the pizza in a way that made it less enjoyable for him. He was expecting to eat the pizza as it was, but now the slices are messed with. \n\nBut wait, the pizza was ordered for both of them. Even though she initially said she didn't want anything, maybe she changed her mind. However, she didn't take an entire slice, but rather modified the existing ones. That could be seen as inconsiderate because she changed the food without asking. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't specify that the pizza was exclusively for him. If he ordered it for both, she might have thought she could take from it. But she didn't just take one piece; she took toppings from every piece. That seems more selfish. \n\nThe author's reaction was to get angry and call her selfish. Is that justified? If the pizza was meant to be shared, then her actions were inconsiderate. However, the author didn't ask her to not take from the pizza, so maybe she thought it was okay. But modifying all the pizza pieces would make it hard for him to enjoy his own order. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was confusing and defensive. She didn't seem to understand his anger. She might have thought it was okay to take without asking, but that's a communication issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? If the pizza was his and he didn't want her to alter it without asking, then his anger is valid. But if it was meant to be shared and she took a reasonable amount, maybe. But she took toppings from all pieces, which is more than just a little. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to be upset. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
