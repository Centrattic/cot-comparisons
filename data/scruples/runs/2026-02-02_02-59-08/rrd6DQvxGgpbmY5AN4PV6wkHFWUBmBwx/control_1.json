The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author saying something was \"obvious\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't mean to be snarky but used the word \"obviously,\" which his girlfriend found offensive. She's a psych major, so she might have felt that the conclusion wasn't obvious when she first learned it, and his comment made her feel dumb. The author, on the other hand, thinks it was a safe assumption and doesn't see why her feelings were hurt.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. People's feelings are valid, and if someone is upset, the right approach is usually to acknowledge their feelings and apologize, even if you don't fully agree. The author's response of \"I don't care\" and dismissing her feelings by saying she should get over it seems to lack empathy. He acknowledges that he hurt her but doesn't want to apologize, which is a red flag.\n\nIn relationships, how you handle disagreements matters. The author's insistence that her reaction is overblown and his refusal to apologize could lead to further conflict. Validating someone's feelings doesn't mean you have to agree with them, but it shows respect. The girlfriend is seeking an apology, which is a common way to resolve such issues. The author's refusal might indicate a pattern of not respecting her emotional needs, which could be a bigger problem.\n\nSo, even if the author's intent wasn't malicious, the impact on his girlfriend's feelings is real. The correct answer here is likely that the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and refused to apologize when she was hurt. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
