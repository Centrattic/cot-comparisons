The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they did something wrong by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author argues that the experiment's conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psychology major, the girlfriend should have known it. The author doesn't think they need to apologize because they don't see the issue, even though the girlfriend feels offended.\n\nFirst, I should consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" In many contexts, this word can come across as dismissive or condescending. Even if the author didn't intend it that way, the effect on the girlfriend was negative. The key here is that the girlfriend felt hurt and stupid. The author's response to her feelings was to say \"I don't care\" and to invalidate her feelings by saying it shouldn't be a big deal. That seems problematic because it's about how someone feels, not just the intention behind the words.\n\nThe girlfriend is a psych major, so the experiment's conclusion being well-known might be part of her studies. However, even if she's a student in the field, not knowing something immediately doesn't make her less smart. People can learn and understand concepts over time. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious could be a bit arrogant, especially if the experiment wasn't part of her recent studies or if she was still processing the information.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and their insistence that the girlfriend shouldn't get offended over small things is another point. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. Dismissing someone's feelings as being too sensitive can lead to resentment. The author's behavior of not caring about her feelings, even if unintentional, might be seen as not respecting her perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the conversation. If the discussion was meant to be collaborative and supportive, using \"obviously\" could have undermined the girlfriend's contribution. It's possible that the experiment wasn't as obvious as the author thought, or maybe the girlfriend was proud of learning it, and the author's comment negated that pride.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author continued to argue after the girlfriend expressed her hurt feelings shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author believes they're right, the priority in a relationship should be to address the emotional impact rather than justifying one's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely not see the problem. They might believe that pointing out something obvious is just a matter of fact and not a personal attack. However, the issue here is communication style and sensitivity. Words that seem harmless to one person can be harmful to another, especially in intimate relationships where people have different sensitivities.\n\nIn summary, while the author didn't intend to be condescending, the use of \"obviously\" had a hurtful effect. The refusal to apologize and the dismissal of the girlfriend's feelings further contribute to the problem. In relationships, it's crucial to acknowledge and validate each other's emotions, even if the person doesn't fully understand why the emotion was triggered. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting their girlfriend's feelings and responding appropriately.\n"
