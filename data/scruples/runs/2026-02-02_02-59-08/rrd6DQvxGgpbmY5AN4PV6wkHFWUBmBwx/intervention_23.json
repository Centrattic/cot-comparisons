The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their girlfriend an experiment's conclusion was obvious, and she got hurt because she felt that made her look dumb. The author argues that since the conclusion is well-known and she's a psych major, it was safe to assume she knew it. But she felt it wasn't obvious to her when she first learned it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" From what I know, using \"obviously\" can be condescending, even if the person doesn't mean it that way. It might come off as dismissive of the other person's perspective or feelings. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected more nuance in the discussion. She found it offensive because she didn't see it as obvious at the time, and the author's comment made her feel that her experience was being minimized.\n\nThe author says they didn't use it snarkily, just stated it as a fact. But the key here is about how the receiver felt. The author's intention vs. the girlfriend's perception. Even if the conclusion is commonly known, the author's use of \"obviously\" might have implied that the girlfriend should have known it or that her not realizing it immediately was a sign of not being smart. The author also mentions not caring about her feelings, which can be a big issue in relationships. Dismissing someone's feelings as not being valid can lead to further hurt.\n\nThen, the author says they told the girlfriend they don't care about her feelings here, which seems harsh. Even if they do care in general, invalidating her reaction by saying \"I don't care\" can make her feel unheard. The girlfriend's point is that using that word was offensive to her, and the author is refusing to apologize, thinking she should get over it. This shows a lack of empathy on the author's part. In relationships, acknowledging each other's feelings is important, even if you don't agree with their interpretation. The author's refusal to apologize and the insistence that it's a small thing might be the bigger problem here.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that it's a well-known concept and the girlfriend should have known it's obvious is flawed. Just because something is obvious to the author doesn't mean it was to the girlfriend, especially if she found it cool and interesting when she first learned it. Everyone has different experiences and may not find the same things obvious. The author's assumption that their perspective is the only valid one is likely what caused the hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did use a word that could be seen as condescending, and even if they didn't mean it that way, the girlfriend's feelings were hurt. The author's response of not caring and not apologizing further validates the girlfriend's feelings of being dismissed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider the girlfriend's feelings and dismissed her reaction instead of addressing it.\n"
