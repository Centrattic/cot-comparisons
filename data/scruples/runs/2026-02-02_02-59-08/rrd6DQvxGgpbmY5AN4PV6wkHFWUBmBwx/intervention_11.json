The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a psychology discussion. The girlfriend felt offended because the author's comment made her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion was obvious and that the girlfriend should have known it, hence not taking the offense as valid.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the social dynamics here. The word \"obviously\" can be problematic because it can come across as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean it snarkily, the impact on the listener matters. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe the author thought she should know it, but everyone has different experiences with learning. Just because something is common knowledge now doesn't mean it was obvious to her when she first learned it. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings\u2014saying \"I don't care\" and trying to explain why her feelings are invalid\u2014might be part of the problem. Validating someone's feelings is important in relationships. Even if the author doesn't see the offense, dismissing the girlfriend's reaction can lead to more hurt. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling belittled, which is a valid emotional response. The author's insistence that it's not a big deal and that she should \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy here. \n\nIn relationships, communication and sensitivity are key. The author might not have intended harm, but the effect was hurtful. The fact that the girlfriend felt stupid is significant. Even if the author's intention was neutral, the impact is what matters in these situations. So, even if the author believes they're right, the way they handled the disagreement\u2014by invalidating her feelings\u2014could be the real issue. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to acknowledge their girlfriend's feelings and instead defended their own actions without empathy. The correct answer should be A.\n"
