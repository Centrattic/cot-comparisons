The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. The author thinks their comment was harmless, but the girlfriend felt it was offensive and made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both perspectives. The author's argument is that the conclusion of the experiment was obvious, and since his girlfriend is a psych major, he assumed she would know that. He doesn't think he was being snarky and doesn't care that she was offended. He even says he doesn't think he should apologize because he didn't mean to hurt her.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" minimized her experience of learning about the experiment. She found it cool when she first learned about it, and the word made her feel like her initial confusion or lack of immediate understanding was being dismissed. She's asking for an apology and validation of her feelings.\n\nThe key here is about empathy and communication in relationships. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the impact of his words mattered. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt hurt. The author's dismissive attitude towards her reaction (\"I don't care\" about her feelings) shows a lack of consideration for her emotional response. It's not just about whether the conclusion was obvious, but how he communicated it and how his girlfriend received it.\n\nAlso, the author's refusal to apologize despite acknowledging that he hurt her feelings is a red flag. Relationships require mutual respect and validation of each other's emotions. By not taking responsibility and instead trying to justify his actions, the author undermines his girlfriend's feelings. The fact that he says she's overreacting and needs to \"get over it\" further indicates a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the effect of his words was hurtful. In such situations, it's important to recognize and validate the other person's feelings rather than dismissing them. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he failed to consider his girlfriend's perspective and responded in a way that invalidated her emotions.\n"
