The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hurt his girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. He thought it was a well-known concept, so it was obvious, but she felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't realize it was obvious when she learned about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The key issue is the use of \"obviously.\" Even if the author genuinely didn't mean it snarkily, the word can come off as dismissive or condescending. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might have assumed she knew the concept well, but she might not have known it was so obvious at the time she learned it. \n\nThe author's problem is that he's dismissing her feelings by saying it's not a big deal and that she shouldn't get offended. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, the effect was there. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't see the issue. By telling her to \"get over it\" and not apologizing, he's invalidating her experience, which can be more harmful. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's a psych major might mean he should be more aware of how language affects others. The girlfriend is explaining why the word is offensive, and instead of listening and apologizing, he's defensive. That defensiveness could be part of the problem. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact was there. The responsibility is on him to acknowledge her feelings and apologize, even if he doesn't see the issue. In AITA cases, the focus is on the hurt feelings and whether the person acted appropriately. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
