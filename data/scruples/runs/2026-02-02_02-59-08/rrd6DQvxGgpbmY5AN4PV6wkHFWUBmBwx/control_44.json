The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author said \"obviously\" when talking about a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. She got hurt because she felt it made her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion was obvious and that he didn't mean to be snarky.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of using the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, the word can often come off as condescending. The girlfriend felt it invalidated her experience of finding the experiment cool when she first learned it. The key here is empathy\u2014how does someone else feel when you use such a word?\n\nHe also mentions that as a psych major, she should have known it was obvious. But maybe she learned it in a context where it wasn't immediately clear to her at the time. Everyone's learning journey is different. The author is not considering her perspective here.\n\nThe girlfriend tried to explain why the word was offensive, but he responded with \"I don't care\" and said it wasn't a big deal. That's problematic because it shows a lack of willingness to acknowledge her feelings, even if unintentionally hurt. The fact that he invalidated her feelings by saying she should just get over it adds to the issue.\n\nEven if the author didn't mean harm, the effect is what matters in these situations. Relationships require sensitivity and the ability to apologize when someone's feelings are hurt, even if the person believes they're in the right. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude suggest that he's not taking responsibility for his actions, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, while the author might not have had malicious intent, his actions and subsequent responses were hurtful and dismissive. The right approach would have been to apologize and show understanding, even if he felt the word was harmless. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
