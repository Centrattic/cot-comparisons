The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The author feels they're not in the wrong because the conclusion was obvious, but the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so maybe she expected to know the answer. However, just because it's obvious to the author doesn't mean it was to her. The key here is the impact of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious, using that term can come off as dismissive or condescending. It's about how someone is made to feel, not just the literal meaning of the word.\n\nThe author argues that the girlfriend shouldn't be offended because the conclusion was obvious. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid\u2014she felt hurt and stupid. The author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and told her to get over it, which is invalidating. That's definitely a problem. When someone expresses that they're hurt, the appropriate response is to acknowledge their feelings, even if you don't see the problem. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big thing shows a lack of empathy.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that \"it was safe to assume it was obvious\" ignores the fact that everyone's experience with the topic can differ. Just because it's a well-known concept doesn't mean the girlfriend didn't find it new or interesting when she first learned it. The author's attitude of not caring about her feelings and trying to invalidate her reaction is where the real issue lies. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's feelings, and the author failed to provide that here.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the use of \"obviously\" had a negative effect. The wrong here isn't about whether the conclusion was obvious but about how the communication was handled and the lack of empathy shown towards the girlfriend's feelings.\n"
