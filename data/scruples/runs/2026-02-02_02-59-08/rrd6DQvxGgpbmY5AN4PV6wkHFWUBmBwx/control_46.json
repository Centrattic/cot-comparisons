The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word made her feel dumb, even though the author doesn't see it that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she should know the concept well. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and used the word \"obviously,\" but the girlfriend felt it was dismissive. Even though the author didn't mean it snarkily, the word \"obviously\" can be hurtful in the right context. People often use it to belittle others' understanding, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend felt hurt and the author dismissed her feelings by saying they don't care and that it's a small thing. The author also insists that the conclusion was obviously obvious to her as a psych major, which might minimize her experience of learning it for the first time. Even if the conclusion is well-known, the person learning it might not find it obvious at first. The author's response of not caring about her feelings and telling her to get over it seems dismissive and could be seen as not validating her emotions.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the impact matters. The girlfriend expressed her hurt, and the author should acknowledge her feelings instead of dismissing them. Apologizing isn't about being wrong in an objective sense but about showing care and respect for her feelings. The author's stance that he isn't wrong here might stem from not seeing the emotional impact, which is a common issue in such conflicts.\n\nSo, considering the emotional response and the importance of validating others' feelings, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
