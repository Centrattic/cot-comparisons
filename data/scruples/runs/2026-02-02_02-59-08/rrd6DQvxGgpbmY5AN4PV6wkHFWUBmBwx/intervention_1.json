The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the author states that he found the conclusion of the experiment obvious and mentioned it in a straightforward manner. His girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She explained that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her, and his comment made her feel like she wasn't as smart. \n\nNow, the key points here are about empathy and communication in a relationship. The author's intention was likely not to be dismissive, but the impact of his words was hurtful. Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious to him, using \"obviously\" can come across as condescending, especially in a close relationship where partners should be mindful of each other's feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were disrespected when he didn't apologize and instead argued that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when she tried to explain her perspective further escalated the situation. By not acknowledging her feelings and insisting that it wasn't a big deal, he invalidates her experience. In relationships, it's important to listen and validate each other's emotions, even if the reasoning isn't immediately clear. \n\nThe author might believe that since the conclusion was obvious, his comment was justified. However, the issue isn't about the factual obviousness but about how his words affected her. Relationships often require compromise and understanding, so expecting her to \"get over it\" isn't helpful. The fact that she felt her feelings were hurt and he didn't apologize shows a lack of consideration for her emotional state. \n\nIn summary, even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the way he communicated his point and failed to validate his girlfriend's feelings is what's problematic here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
