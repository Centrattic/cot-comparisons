The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb, even though the author didn't mean it that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their communication. The author says they used the word \"obviously\" not in a snarky way but just to express that the conclusion was clear. However, the girlfriend's reaction was hurtful because she felt it was a personal attack on her intelligence or understanding. \n\nEven if the conclusion is indeed obvious, the key here is the perception and the emotional impact on the other person. The girlfriend is a psych major, yet she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have overlooked her personal experience of learning it and how she felt about it. \n\nThe author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she tried to explain why it was offensive. That's a problem because it invalidates her emotions. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the response of dismissing her feelings makes the situation worse. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should have acknowledged that even if they didn't agree with the level of hurt.\n\nAlso, the author's insistence that it's not a big thing and that the girlfriend should just get over it is not a constructive approach. In relationships, empathy and understanding are important. Even if someone's feelings seem trivial to you, they are real to the person experiencing them. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was both in the initial use of \"obviously\" (which could be seen as condescending, even unintentionally) and in not validating the girlfriend's feelings afterward. The author should take responsibility for hurting her feelings and apologize, not just because they were wrong, but because respecting each other's emotions is crucial in a relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
