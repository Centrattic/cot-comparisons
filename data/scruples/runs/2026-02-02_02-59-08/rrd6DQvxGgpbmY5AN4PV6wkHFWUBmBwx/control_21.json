The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with a girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't realize the conclusion was obvious when she first learned about it, and the author's use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author, however, thinks it was obvious and doesn't see why it's a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication styles. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if the intention isn't snarky. People's reactions can vary, but the key here is the girlfriend's feelings. The author assumes that because the conclusion is well-known, she should have known it was obvious. But she's a psych major, so maybe she knew the experiment but not the conclusion's obviousness. Or maybe she just found it interesting even if it was obvious.\n\nThe author's response when she expressed being hurt was to say \"I don't care\" and dismiss her feelings. That's a problem. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, the response invalidates her emotions. When someone is hurt, responding with indifference or disagreement can escalate the issue. The author also insists that she should just get over it, which isn't helpful. Apologizing is expected when you hurt someone's feelings, regardless of intent. The fact that he refuses to apologize and expects her to move on shows a lack of empathy.\n\nThe core issue is the use of \"obviously\" in a context where it undermined her experience. Even if the conclusion is obvious, pointing that out can make the other person feel their experience isn't valid. The author didn't consider that. So, even if he didn't mean to, he should have been more careful with his words and acknowledged her feelings instead of dismissing them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
