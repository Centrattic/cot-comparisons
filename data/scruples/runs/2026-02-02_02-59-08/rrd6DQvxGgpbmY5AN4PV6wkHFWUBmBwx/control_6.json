The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment. The girl mentions an experiment she learned in class, and the guy responds with \"obviously\" because the conclusion seems obvious to him. The girl feels hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it, and she's upset that he used \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. The guy thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion is indeed obvious, and he's frustrated that she's taking it so personally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is a psych major, so maybe she expected him to understand that some concepts, while now well-known, might not be obvious to someone when they first encounter them. Using \"obviously\" can be dismissive, even if the speaker isn't intending to be snarky. The key here is that the word \"obviously\" can minimize the other person's experience, regardless of the actual knowledge level. \n\nThe guy mentions that he doesn't think he's wrong because he didn't use a snarky tone. But the problem isn't just the word itself, but how it affects the other person. Even if the conclusion was obvious, using \"obviously\" might imply that the other person should have known it, leading to the feeling of being belittled. \n\nThe girl's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The guy's refusal to apologize and his assertion that she shouldn't get offended over \"little things\" shows a lack of empathy. He's dismissing her feelings, which is a problem in a relationship. Effective communication involves validating each other's emotions, even if you don't agree with the reasoning. \n\nThe guy's stance that he doesn't care about people being offended in similar situations doesn't take into account that everyone has different sensitivities. What might not hurt him could hurt her. The fact that he invalidated her feelings by calling it a \"big thing\" and insisting she should move on exacerbates the issue. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge the partner's emotions, even if you don't see the problem from their perspective. The guy's approach here is causing more tension because he's not willing to apologize, which shows he's not prioritizing her feelings. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact is what matters here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy's use of \"obviously\" hurt her feelings, and his response after that made things worse. He should apologize and understand that her feelings are valid. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
