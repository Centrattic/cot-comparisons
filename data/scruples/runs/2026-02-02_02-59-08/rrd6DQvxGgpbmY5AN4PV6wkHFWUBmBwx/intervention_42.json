The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault. The scenario is about a disagreement between a couple where the guy used the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. She felt hurt because the term made her feel dumb, even though he didn't mean it that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major who learned the concept in her class. The guy said the conclusion was obvious. The key here is that he used \"obviously,\" which can be a trigger for people because it implies the other person should know something, potentially belittling their experience. Even if the conclusion is indeed well-known, using that word might not be considerate.\n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he didn't intend to be snarky and thought the conclusion was obvious. He mentions that as a psych major, he assumed she would have known it was obvious. However, the problem is that she didn't see it that way. She felt that his comment invalidated her experience of finding the experiment cool and not obvious to her when she first learned it. \n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I should consider why. The main points here are communication and empathy. Even if the guy didn't mean to hurt her, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt the word was offensive. The guy then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her to stop getting offended over small things. This shows a lack of empathy and willingness to understand her perspective. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she felt belittled. The author's response of not caring and invalidating her feelings exacerbates the situation. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the communication method was hurtful. The key here is that the intention doesn't negate the impact. She felt stupid, and the author's refusal to apologize or consider her feelings further damages the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he used a word that can be hurtful, dismissed her feelings, and tried to invalidate her experience instead of acknowledging her perspective. The correct approach would be to apologize and show understanding, even if he didn't intend harm.\n"
