The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man said the conclusion was obvious, using \"obviously,\" which he didn't mean to be snarky. His girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time and the word made her feel stupid. The man is defending his use of the word, saying it was safe to assume she knew it, and he doesn't think he should apologize. The girlfriend is upset and wants an apology.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the use of \"obviously\" was hurtful. Even if the man didn't mean it that way, the impact on his girlfriend is real. In relationships, it's important to consider how your words affect others. The man is dismissing her feelings by saying he doesn't care that she's offended and even tells her to get over it. That's a problem because it invalidates her emotions. \n\nHe's in a position where he should acknowledge her feelings even if he doesn't agree. The fact that he's a psych major and she's a psych major might mean he should be more aware of the dynamics here. The word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, regardless of intent. \n\nAlso, the man's response after the fact is key. He's not willing to apologize because he thinks her feelings shouldn't have been hurt. That's a sign he's not being empathetic. In a healthy relationship, both partners should validate each other's feelings, even if they can't change their initial reaction. \n\nSo, even if he didn't mean to be offensive, the effect was hurtful. The man's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude towards her feelings likely makes him at least partially in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
