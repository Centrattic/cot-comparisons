The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb, even though the author didn't mean to be snarky. \n\nFirst, I need to consider communication styles. The word \"obviously\" often implies that something is so clear that others should know it without being told. In the context of a conversation where the girlfriend is sharing something she learned, using \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive. Even if the author didn't intend it that way, the effect is what matters here. \n\nThe girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected the author to respect her academic experience. When she learned the concept wasn't obvious to her initially, the author's comment might have undermined her experience. The key point is that the author assumed something was obvious to her when she found it challenging before. That's a mismatch in expectations.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the girlfriend's feelings was dismissive. Saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing, even after acknowledging hurting her, shows a lack of empathy. The author might think it's a small issue, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid. Her feelings were hurt, and the author's refusal to apologize could damage the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, validating each other's feelings is crucial. The author's insistence that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" suggests they're not considering her emotional perspective. Even if the author believes they're right, the way they handled the situation is problematic. The use of \"obviously\" was a mistake, and not apologizing compounds the issue. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because their words and subsequent reactions hurt the girlfriend's feelings and failed to acknowledge her perspective.\n"
