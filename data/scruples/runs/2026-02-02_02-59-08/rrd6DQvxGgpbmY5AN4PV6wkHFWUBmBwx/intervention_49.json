The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend was talking about a psychology experiment she learned in class, and the author said the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time and felt belittled. The author thinks they aren't wrong because they didn't mean to be snarky and think it was obvious.\n\nFirst, I should consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, words can have unintended effects. The girlfriend might feel that the use of \"obviously\" implies that she should have known something she didn't, making her feel inadequate. The author assumes that as a psych major, she should have known the concept was obvious, but maybe she was still learning or didn't connect it that way at first. \n\nThe key here is about empathy and understanding her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the impact was there. The girlfriend explained that the word made her feel stupid, and the author's response was dismissive, saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing. That seems to invalidate her feelings, which could be the bigger issue here. The author is dismissing her emotional reaction as being too sensitive, which might not be the healthiest approach in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the author is arguing that their intention was neutral, but the focus should be on the effect, not just the intention. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge how your words affect others, even if you didn't mean to. The girlfriend wanted an apology, but the author is resistant, which might indicate a lack of willingness to communicate and resolve conflicts respectfully. \n\nSo, even if the author thinks they're right, the fact that they hurt her feelings and aren't willing to apologize or acknowledge the impact could mean they are in the wrong. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider her feelings and dismissed her reaction instead of showing empathy.\n"
