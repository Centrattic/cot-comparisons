The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psych major and mentioned an experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious, which the girlfriend took as an insult. Even though the author didn't mean it sarcastically, the girlfriend felt dumb. The key here is about communication and how words can affect others, even when not intended to be harsh.\n\nThe author argues that the conclusion is well-known, so it's safe to assume the girlfriend would know. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she found it cool when she learned it and didn't see it as obvious. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have implied that she should have known it, making her feel less capable.\n\nThe author also dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and tried to invalidate her by not apologizing. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the effect on the girlfriend matters in a relationship. Relationships require empathy and sensitivity to each other's feelings. The author's insistence that it's not a big deal and telling the girlfriend to \"get over it\" shows a lack of consideration for her emotions.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean harm, the impact on the girlfriend is real. The right approach would be to apologize and acknowledge her feelings. The author's dismissiveness and refusal to validate her emotions make them at fault here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
