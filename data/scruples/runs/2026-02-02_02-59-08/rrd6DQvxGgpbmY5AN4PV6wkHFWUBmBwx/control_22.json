The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The situation is that the girlfriend felt it was offensive and made her feel dumb, even though the author thought the conclusion was obvious and didn't mean to be snarky.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said \"that\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been.\" The girlfriend, a psych major, felt that the use of \"obviously\" was hurtful. The author argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so it's safe to assume she would know. However, she felt it was obvious after learning it, but not when she first learned it. The author says he doesn't think the feelings were valid and even said \"I don't care\" when she explained her hurt feelings. He's refusing to apologize and wants her to \"get over it.\"\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships. Using \"obviously\" can be dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the word itself can come off as condescending. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's about her feelings. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and instead invalidate them by saying \"I don't care\" and telling her to get over it is problematic. Emotional support in a relationship requires validating each other's feelings, even if you don't see eye to eye. The author's stance is that his actions weren't wrong, but the fact that he didn't apologize and tried to minimize her feelings suggests he's in the wrong. The key here is that the author is not respecting her emotional response. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, the impact is still there, and a healthy relationship involves considering the other person's perspective and emotions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
