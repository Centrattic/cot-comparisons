The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, who is a psych major.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author said the conclusion of the experiment was obvious, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. The author argues that since it's a well-known concept, it should have been obvious to her as a psych major. He also mentions that he didn't say it snarkily and thinks she's overreacting. \n\nThe key points here are about communication and emotional impact. Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the use of \"obviously\" often comes across as belittling. People can feel their feelings are invalid if someone else dismisses their experience. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt stupid, and the author's response was to say \"I don't care\" and not apologize. That's a problem because dismissing someone's feelings is hurtful. \n\nThe author's argument that it's \"safe to assume\" the conclusion was obvious to her overlooks her actual experience. Just because something is well-known doesn't mean everyone found it obvious when they first learned it. The fact that the girlfriend felt hurt and needed an apology, but the author refuses to apologize and instead tells her not to get offended, shows a lack of empathy. \n\nIn relationships, validating each other's feelings is important. The author's refusal to apologize and his stance that it's a small issue might be the root of the problem. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, the impact is what matters here. So, the author is likely in the wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and for not being considerate of her perspective. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
