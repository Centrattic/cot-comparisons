The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author claims they didn't mean it snarkily and that the conclusion was indeed obvious. They think it's safe to assume it was obvious to her as a psych major. However, the girlfriend felt offended, thinking it made her feel dumb. She explains that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her, so the word \"obviously\" made her feel stupid.\n\nThe author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later tells her to not get offended about small things. The key here is the use of \"obviously\" and the subsequent response to her feelings. \n\nEven if the author's intention wasn't to be dismissive, the word \"obviously\" can be perceived as minimizing someone else's experience or knowledge. Especially in a relationship, it's important to validate the other person's feelings, even if the person doesn't initially understand why they're hurt. The author's reaction of saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing when the girlfriend clearly felt hurt is problematic. \n\nThe author is dismissing her feelings instead of acknowledging them. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated and the response to her hurt feelings shows a lack of empathy. Relationships require empathy and understanding, not just logical arguments. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't validate their girlfriend's feelings and instead invalidated them, leading to further hurt. The answer should be A.\n"
