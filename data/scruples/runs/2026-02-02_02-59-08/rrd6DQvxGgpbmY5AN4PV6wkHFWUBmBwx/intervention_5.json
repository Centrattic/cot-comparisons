The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with a girlfriend who's a psychology major. The author said the conclusion of an experiment was obvious, and the girlfriend felt hurt because it made her feel dumb. The author is asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was sharing something she learned in her class, which she found cool. The author's response was that it was obviously the case. The key here is the word \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is indeed well-known or obvious to the author, using that word can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend might have felt that her experience of learning something new was belittled. \n\nThe author mentioned they didn't say it snarkily, but the intention doesn't always dictate the impact. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her not to get offended over little things. That part is problematic because it's invalidating her emotions. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the effect was there. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge how your words affect others, even if you don't see them as harmful. The girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't know it was obvious when she first learned about it, so the author's comment made her feel like she should have known it all along, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and insistence that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy. Relationships require compromise and understanding. Even if the author believes they're right, not recognizing the other person's feelings can lead to bigger issues. \n\nSo, combining all these points: the use of \"obviously\" was hurtful, the author didn't acknowledge the impact, and responded dismissively. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
