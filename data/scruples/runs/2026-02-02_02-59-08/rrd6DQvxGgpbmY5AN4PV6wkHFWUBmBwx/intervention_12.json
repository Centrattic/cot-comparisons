The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt offended and hurt, while the author doesn't think they did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author said the conclusion was obvious, not in a snarky way but as a statement. The girlfriend, a psych major, found the experiment interesting when she first learned about it, but the author's use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She emphasized that many people might find that word offensive. The author, however, dismissed her feelings by saying they don't care and that it's not a big deal.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. Using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. Even if the conclusion is well-known, the author should consider that the other person might have learned it in a new context or found it enlightening at the time. The author's response to the girlfriend's feelings (calling her overreacting and not caring about her feelings) shows a lack of empathy. \n\nIn relationships, acknowledging someone's feelings is crucial. Even if the author thinks their comment was harmless, dismissing the girlfriend's hurt feelings invalidates her experience. The fact that the author had to be told repeatedly and then responded by not caring suggests they're not prioritizing their partner's emotions. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend matters. The right approach would be to apologize, understand her perspective, and avoid such language in the future. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that she should get over it indicates they're in the wrong.\n"
