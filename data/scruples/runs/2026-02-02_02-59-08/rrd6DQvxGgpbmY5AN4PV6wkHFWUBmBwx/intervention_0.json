The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their girlfriend feel hurt by using the word \"obviously.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. He found the conclusion obvious and said so. She felt offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, so he assumed she knew it was obvious. She was upset because she hadn't realized it was obvious when she first learned about it.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend felt hurt, and the author dismissed her feelings, saying he didn't think it was a big deal. He even told her he didn't care about her feelings in that moment, which is a problem because acknowledging someone's emotions is important in relationships.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the conclusion was indeed obvious, so he didn't mean to offend. However, the issue isn't the correctness of his statement but the impact it had. Even if something is obvious to one person, using \"obviously\" can make others feel their understanding is questioned. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected. When she tried to explain why the word was offensive, the author dismissed her again by saying \"I don't care,\" which invalidates her feelings further. \n\nIn healthy relationships, validating each other's emotions is crucial. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt suggest a lack of empathy. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the effect is still real, and the appropriate response would be to apologize and adjust his communication in the future. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. He should have been more mindful of his choice of words and respected her feelings instead of dismissing them.\n"
