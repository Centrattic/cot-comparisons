The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. He said the conclusion was obvious, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. She thinks using \"obviously\" was offensive and made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think he was wrong, argues that the conclusion really is obvious, and that as a psych major, she should have known that. He says he doesn't care if she's offended and thinks she should just get over it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and empathy. Using \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were disrespected. The author is dismissing her perspective, thinking that the conclusion is so clear that she should have known it was obvious. But the problem is that he's not considering her experience. She took time to learn about this in her class and found it cool, but when he said it was obvious, it undermined her experience of learning it. That's where the hurt comes in.\n\nThe author isn't just using the word \"obviously,\" but he's also making assumptions about her knowledge and experience. Even if the conclusion is widely known, she might not have seen the connection immediately when she first learned about the experiment. His response invalidates her feelings by insisting that it was obvious and that she should have known. That's not being empathetic. Relationships require validation of each other's experiences, even if you don't see eye to eye on the content. \n\nHe also mentions not caring about her feelings after she's already hurt, which adds to the problem. Even if he apologizes later, the initial dismissiveness and the insistence that she's wrong to feel hurt is problematic. The fact that he says she should just get over it suggests a lack of understanding and empathy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's use of \"obviously\" in this context was hurtful. His response to her hurt feelings\u2014saying she's overreacting and that he doesn't care\u2014shows a lack of empathy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
