The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author used the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned about it. The author argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that, as a psych major, the girlfriend should have known it, so using \"obviously\" wasn't meant to be offensive. They also mention that they don't think the girlfriend should get upset over such a small thing and that they don't care about her feelings in this case, even though they say they do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" From what I know, using \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive or condescending, even if the speaker doesn't intend it that way. The key point here is that the girlfriend felt hurt and made to feel dumb. The author's defense is that the conclusion was obvious and that the girlfriend, being a psych major, should have known it. But the girlfriend's experience is that she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. So there's a disconnect between the author's perception and the girlfriend's experience.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings is important. The girlfriend is trying to explain why the word was offensive, but the author dismisses her by saying \"I don't care.\" They also accuse her of overreacting. This seems like invalidating her feelings, which can be a big issue in relationships. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the effect was there, and the response to that hurt (not caring and telling her to get over it) is problematic.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author is not taking responsibility for how their words made the girlfriend feel. Instead of apologizing and understanding her perspective, they're justifying their actions and minimizing her feelings. That's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the author says they don't think they should apologize because they don't see the issue. That's not considering that different people have different sensitivities. What's obvious to one person might not be to another, and using words that make someone feel inadequate isn't helpful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt, regardless of whether the author thinks the situation is trivial.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author didn't have malicious intent, their words hurt someone they care about, and their response was dismissive. That makes them at fault. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
