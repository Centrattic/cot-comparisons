The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the word was dismissive and made her feel dumb. The author, however, doesn't think they're in the wrong because they believe the conclusion was obvious and that the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so she might have a different perspective on the experiment. The author used \"obviously,\" which is often seen as a negative term because it can come off as condescending. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the effect was that the girlfriend felt invalidated. \n\nThe key here is the impact of the words, not just the intention. The author acknowledges that \"obviously\" can be offensive but argues that in this case, it wasn't. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The author's response when she expressed her feelings was dismissive\u2014they said \"I don't care\" about her feelings and that she should get over it. This invalidation of her emotions is probably the bigger issue. \n\nThe girlfriend might have felt that her experience of learning something and finding it cool was disregarded. The author assumed that since she's a psych major, she should have known it was obvious. But people learn at different paces, and even experts might find things non-obvious when first encountering them. The author's failure to consider her perspective and instead dismiss her feelings as overreactions shows a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, even if the conclusion was indeed obvious, the way the author communicated it and their subsequent dismissal of her feelings make them at fault. The main issue isn't the word itself but the lack of consideration for her emotional response and the refusal to acknowledge her feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
