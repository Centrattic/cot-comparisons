The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with the girlfriend. The key points here are communication style, the perception of the partner, and whether the author's response was dismissive.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is a psych major and was talking about an experiment. She felt the conclusion was cool when she learned it, but the author said it was obvious. The author thought it was obvious because it's a well-known concept. The girlfriend felt hurt and stupid because she didn't see it as obvious at the time. \n\nNow, the author argues that the word \"obviously\" isn't offensive this time and that it's safe to assume the girlfriend would know it. But the problem here is that the girlfriend's experience and feelings are being invalidated. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be snarky, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. The author then responds by saying \"I don't care\" when she explains her hurt feelings and later tells her to not get offended over little things. That's problematic because it shows a lack of empathy and respect for her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, validation is important. The author's response of not caring about her feelings and trying to downplay her hurtful experience is definitely in the wrong. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact of the words matters. Additionally, the author's refusal to apologize and insistence that the girlfriend should just get over it is dismissive and hurtful. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt stupid, and the author's reaction of not caring about her feelings contradicts his claim of caring. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for using the word that hurt her feelings and for responding in a way that invalidated her emotions. The answer should be A.\n"
