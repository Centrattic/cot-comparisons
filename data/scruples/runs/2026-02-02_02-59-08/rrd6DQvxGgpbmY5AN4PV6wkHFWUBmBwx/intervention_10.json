The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" and not apologizing. The situation is that the author's girlfriend was upset because he said an experiment's conclusion was obvious. The author thinks he's not at fault because the conclusion really is obvious and he didn't mean to be snarky.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so she's probably learned about the experiment in depth. But she felt that the author was belittling her by implying that the conclusion was so obvious she should have known it. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge in the field, the way it was said might have been dismissive of her experience learning it.\n\nThe author uses the word \"obviously,\" which is often a trigger for people because it can come off as condescending. The girlfriend explained that she found it cool when she first learned it and didn't realize it was obvious. The author's response was to not apologize and say \"I don't care,\" which shows a lack of empathy. The key here is that the author isn't considering her feelings and is dismissing her reaction as being too sensitive. \n\nEven though the author didn't mean it snarkily, the impact of the word matters. The girlfriend felt stupid, which is a valid emotional response. The author's refusal to apologize further hurt her feelings because he's invalidating her perspective. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge how your words affect others, even if you don't see the issue yourself. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings, used a potentially offensive term, and refused to apologize when she was clearly hurt. The right approach would have been to apologize and explain that he didn't mean to dismiss her, even if he thought the conclusion was obvious. His insistence that she should just get over it is dismissive and unkind.\n"
