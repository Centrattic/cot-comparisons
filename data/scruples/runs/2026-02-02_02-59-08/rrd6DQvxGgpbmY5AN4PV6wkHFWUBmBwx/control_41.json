The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for hurting his girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the author claims that the conclusion of the experiment was obvious. He didn't use a snarky tone, just stated it as a fact. He thought that, as a psychology major, his girlfriend should have found it obvious too. However, she felt offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel like she was being belittled, implying that she was dumb for not realizing it earlier.\n\nThe key here is the impact of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the word can often come off as condescending. People can interpret it as a sign that the speaker thinks the other person is not smart. In this case, the girlfriend was learning about the experiment and found it cool at the time. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have undermined her experience, making her feel like she was wrong or ignorant for not seeing it as obvious before.\n\nThe author then dismisses her feelings by saying he doesn't care about her reaction and tries to justify it by saying he wouldn't be offended if she said the same to him. However, that's a classic \"it's not about me\" argument. The issue isn't about the author's feelings but the girlfriend's. He invalidated her feelings by not apologizing and instead telling her not to get offended over small things. That's a problem because it shows a lack of empathy and respect for her emotions.\n\nEven if the conclusion was indeed obvious, the way he communicated it mattered. In relationships, how you say something is often as important as what you say. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and his insistence that he's right could damage trust and communication. He should have considered her perspective and used a more considerate tone, maybe saying something like, \"That makes sense\" instead of \"Obviously.\"\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's feelings and for not taking responsibility. The answer should be A.\n"
