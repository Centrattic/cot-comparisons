The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. From the description, the situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" to describe a psychological experiment's conclusion, which their girlfriend found offensive. The author argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that they didn't mean to be dismissive, while the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Communication is key in relationships, and sometimes even well-intentioned words can hurt. The author used \"obviously,\" which is often considered a trigger word because it can come off as condescending. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the effect on the girlfriend was hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt the comment undermined her learning experience. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the conclusion was obvious and that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have known it. However, even if the answer is common knowledge, using \"obviously\" can invalidate the other person's experience of learning it. People can take pride in discovering something new, and pointing out that it was \"obvious\" might negate their effort or the context in which they learned it. \n\nAdditionally, the author's response to the girlfriend's hurt feelings was dismissive. They said \"I don't care\" when she explained why the word was offensive, which shows a lack of empathy. The author also told the girlfriend to \"get over it\" about small things, which isn't a healthy approach. Relationships require both partners to be considerate of each other's feelings, even in minor instances. \n\nThe key here is the intention versus the impact. While the author may not have intended to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend was negative. The author should have been more mindful of how their words might be received, especially since the girlfriend was sharing something she found exciting. The fact that the author downplayed her feelings and refused to apologize further exacerbates the issue. \n\nIn many cases, using \"obviously\" in discussions can be a red flag for condescension. Even if the information is common knowledge, the delivery matters. The author's refusal to acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings and their insistence that it wasn't a big deal suggests a lack of emotional intelligence. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt disrespected, which is a legitimate reason for her reaction. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not being considerate of how their words affected their partner and for dismissing her feelings instead of addressing the issue constructively.\n"
