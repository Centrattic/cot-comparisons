The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend. The author said the conclusion of an experiment was obvious, which upset her because she felt that made her seem dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she's used to learning complex concepts. The experiment's conclusion was obvious to the author, but she didn't find it obvious when she learned it. Using \"obviously\" might have implied that she should have known it was obvious, which could make her feel like she wasn't as knowledgeable or that her experience of learning it wasn't valid.\n\nThe author argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known. But the key point here is that perception matters. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be dismissive, the word \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and disrespected. The author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and told her to get over it, which is a bad approach. Validating emotions is important in relationships, even if you don't agree with the interpretation. The author's response of not caring about her feelings in that moment, even if they do care overall, shows a lack of empathy in the situation. Apologizing is usually necessary when someone's feelings are hurt, especially if the person acknowledges that their words might have been offensive. The author's refusal to apologize and instead trying to justify their actions might be the main issue here. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they hurt her feelings and didn't validate her emotions.\n"
