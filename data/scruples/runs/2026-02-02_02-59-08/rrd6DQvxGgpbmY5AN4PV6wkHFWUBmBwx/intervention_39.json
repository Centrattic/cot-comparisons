The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between him and his girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the guy says he used \"obviously\" because the experiment's conclusion was clear to him. He mentions that as a psychology major, he assumed it would be obvious to her too. But she felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it, and his comment made her feel stupid. He argues that her feelings shouldn't be hurt and that he doesn't need to apologize because he didn't mean it snarkily.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she's used to more complex concepts, but even so, not everything might be obvious. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. People often feel invalidated when someone else minimizes their experience or feelings. The key here is that the girl felt hurt, and the guy isn't acknowledging that her feelings are valid even if he doesn't see it his way.\n\nThe guy's response to her feelings is problematic. He says \"I don't care\" about the broader implications of his word choice, which could be seen as dismissing her emotions. Even if he apologizes later, his initial reaction of not caring and telling her to \"get over it\" is hurtful. In relationships, validating each other's feelings is important. By trying to invalidate her feelings, he's not being supportive. \n\nAlso, the fact that she brought up the experiment with enthusiasm and he undercut her by calling it obvious might have dented her confidence in her own learning experience. Even if the conclusion is well-known, she might have taken pride in understanding it when she first learned it. His comment might have made her feel like she didn't know something fundamental, which is a common issue with the word \"obviously.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might not have intended to hurt her and could see it as a minor issue. But in relationships, intent doesn't always override impact. Even if he meant no harm, the effect on her was negative. The question is whether his actions were wrong. Since he hurt her feelings and dismissed her perspective, it's likely he's in the wrong. He should apologize and work on being more considerate of her feelings in the future.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he used a term that invalidated her experience and then dismissed her feelings instead of showing empathy.\n"
