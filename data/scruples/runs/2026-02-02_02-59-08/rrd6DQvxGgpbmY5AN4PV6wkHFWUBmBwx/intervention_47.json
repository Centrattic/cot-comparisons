The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The main issue is about using the word \"obviously\" which hurt their girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's girlfriend is a psychology major, and they were discussing an experiment. The conclusion was obvious to the author, so they used \"obviously.\" However, the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. \n\nThe key here is the impact of the word choice. Even if the conclusion is objectively obvious, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending. The author might not have intended to be snarky, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid. People can feel invalidated when their experiences or understanding are belittled, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author mentions that they don't think the feelings should have been hurt and even say they don't care. That's problematic because it shows a lack of empathy. Validating someone's feelings is important in a relationship. The author's refusal to apologize and their dismissive attitude (\"I don't care\") likely escalated the situation. \n\nAlso, the author's justification that it was \"safe to assume\" the girlfriend would find it obvious overlooks her perspective. Just because something is obvious to one person doesn't mean it's obvious to another. The girlfriend's reaction about not knowing it was obvious when she first learned it is a personal experience, which the author dismissed.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author should have considered how their words might be received and chosen a different phrasing to avoid making her feel that way. Apologizing shows accountability, which the author is refusing to do, thinking they're not wrong. That refusal to acknowledge the hurt, even if unintentional, is a sign that they are in the wrong.\n"
