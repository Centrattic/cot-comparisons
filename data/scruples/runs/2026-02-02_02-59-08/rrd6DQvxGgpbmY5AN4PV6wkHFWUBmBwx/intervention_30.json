The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, which she found offensive. The author is a psychology major, and they were discussing an experiment. He said the conclusion was obvious, which upset her because it made her feel dumb. She felt that even though it's a well-known concept now, she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it.\n\nThe author argues that since it's a well-known concept, it's reasonable to assume his girlfriend, as a psych major, would find it obvious. He also mentions that he's sorry for hurting her feelings but doesn't think he's wrong. He even tells her to not get offended over small things. The girlfriend wants an apology, but he refuses.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key point is the use of the word \"obviously.\" In relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be dismissive, the effect on his partner is what matters. She felt hurt and stupid. The author seems to be dismissing her feelings by saying he doesn't care about her reaction and that she should get over it. This invalidation can be damaging. \n\nEven if the conclusion is indeed obvious in hindsight, the experience of learning it isn't the same for everyone. The fact that she found it cool when she first learned it shows that it wasn't obvious to her at the time. The author's statement might come across as condescending. Also, his refusal to apologize and his attitude of telling her to not take things personally suggests a lack of empathy. \n\nIn healthy relationships, partners should validate each other's feelings. The author's insistence that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt in the first place and his refusal to apologize are problematic. Even if he didn't mean to, causing hurt and not acknowledging it can strain the relationship. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings, dismissed her reaction, and refused to apologize. The use of \"obviously\" was hurtful, and his response made it worse. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
