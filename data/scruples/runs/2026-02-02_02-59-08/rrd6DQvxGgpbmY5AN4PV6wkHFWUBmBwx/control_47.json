The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the author was making her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion was obvious and that the girlfriend, as a psych major, should have known it. But the girlfriend felt that the use of \"obviously\" was dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The word \"obviously\" can be a trigger in conversations because it can come off as condescending, even if not intended that way. The author says they didn't mean it snarkily, but the effect was still hurtful. The key here is that the author dismissed the girlfriend's feelings, calling her reaction being to \"get over it\" and not caring about her feelings. That's problematic because it's important to validate someone's feelings even if you don't agree with their reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is about how she felt when the author used the word. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's a minor issue might indicate a lack of empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the impact matters in relationships. The author's comment that they don't care if she's offended and that she should just move on is likely to escalate the conflict and show a lack of consideration for her emotions.\n\nIn terms of communication, using \"obviously\" can negate the other person's experience of learning something new. The girlfriend found it cool when she learned about the experiment, and the author's response might have undermined her positive experience. The author's assumption that, as a psych major, she should have known it was obvious is also not valid because everyone's learning journey is different. Just because something is common knowledge doesn't mean it's obvious to everyone at the time they encounter it.\n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and telling her to not get offended over little things is a clear issue. It's important to acknowledge and apologize for causing hurt, even if you don't see the issue the same way. The girlfriend is seeking validation and an apology, which the author is unwilling to give. This unwillingness to validate her feelings can lead to more resentment and damage in the relationship.\n\nIn summary, while the author may not have intended to be hurtful, their actions and responses after the fact show a lack of empathy and validation for the girlfriend's feelings. The key points are the use of a potentially condescending word, the dismissive attitude toward the girlfriend's hurt feelings, and the refusal to apologize. These factors point to the author being in the wrong.\n"
