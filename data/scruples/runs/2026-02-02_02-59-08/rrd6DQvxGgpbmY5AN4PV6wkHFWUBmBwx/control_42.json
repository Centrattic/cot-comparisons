The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because the author implied that the conclusion was so obvious that she should have known it, even though she was a psych major. The author thinks the girlfriend overreacted and doesn't want to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was excited about learning the experiment's conclusion, which wasn't obvious to her at first. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have dismissed her experience of figuring it out, making her feel her effort wasn't valued. Even if the conclusion is indeed well-known, the way it was communicated could have come across as condescending.\n\nCommunication styles vary, but in relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author's response after the girlfriend expressed hurt feelings was dismissive. Saying \"I don't care\" about her feelings and insisting she should get over it shows a lack of empathy. The author's refusal to apologize despite acknowledging the hurt suggests they're not seeing the situation from her perspective.\n\nThe key here is about empathy and respect. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the impact of their words was negative. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because feeling belittled can hurt, especially in a relationship. The author's insistence that it was a small thing and her overreaction highlights a disconnect in how they value each other's emotional states.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to offend, their failure to acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings and their dismissive response make them at fault. The right approach would have been to apologize and reassure her, not to invalidate her emotions.\n"
