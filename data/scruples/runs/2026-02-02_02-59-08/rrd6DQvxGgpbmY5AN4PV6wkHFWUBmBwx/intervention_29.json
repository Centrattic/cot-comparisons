The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who said something was \"obvious\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, who's a psychology major. She felt hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. The guy doesn't think he's in the wrong, arguing that it was obvious and that she should have gotten over it.\n\nFirst, words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The key here is the impact on the other person. Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious to him, the fact that she didn't find it so at the time of learning might be important. As a psych major, she might have been taught to analyze experiments, so maybe she felt her perspective was undervalued.\n\nThe guy then invalidates her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later tells her to not get offended over little things. That's problematic because it dismisses her emotional response. Even if he didn't mean to be offensive, her feelings are valid. Relationships require empathy and acknowledging the other person's emotions, not just logic. By not apologizing and insisting she's overreacting, he's not showing the necessary consideration. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
