The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend feeling hurt when the author said something was \"obvious\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment she learned about in her class.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author claims they didn't mean it snarkily and that the conclusion really is obvious. The girlfriend, however, felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't realize it was so clear when she first learned it. The author is now refusing to apologize, thinking it's a small thing, and even says they don't care about her feelings in this context, though they admit they do care overall.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess whether that's accurate. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were hurt. The author's response to her explanation is dismissive\u2014they say \"I don't care\" and invalidate her feelings. Even if the author believes the conclusion was obvious, the way they communicated that might have been hurtful. \n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and their insistence that the girlfriend \"should have just gotten over it\" shows a lack of empathy. It's not about whether the conclusion was actually obvious, but about how the comment affected her. In healthy relationships, acknowledging and validating a partner's feelings is important, even if the person doesn't see the issue themselves. The fact that the girlfriend found it offensive and the author is now making it worse by not empathizing points towards the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
