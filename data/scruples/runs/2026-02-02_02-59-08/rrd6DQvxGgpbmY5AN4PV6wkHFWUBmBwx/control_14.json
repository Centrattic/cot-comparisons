The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the \"I\" in the story) is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't think the conclusion was obvious when she first learned about it, and the author dismissed her feelings by not apologizing and insisting it was obvious.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the author's use of \"obviously\" was inappropriate. The girlfriend is a psych major, which might suggest she has some familiarity with the topic, but even experts can find certain concepts less obvious at first. The key here is how the word \"obviously\" is perceived. Using \"obviously\" can sometimes come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. It might imply that the other person should have known the answer, making them feel inadequate if they didn't.\n\nThe author argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so it's safe to assume the girlfriend knew it. However, the context is personal, and the girlfriend's experience in learning the concept is different from the author's. She felt it wasn't obvious when she first encountered it. The author's dismissal of her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing is a problem. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the effect on the girlfriend is what matters in this case. Relationships require empathy and validating each other's feelings, even if one doesn't fully agree. By refusing to apologize and trying to invalidate her emotions, the author shows a lack of consideration for her perspective, which is a common issue in such conflicts.\n\nThe author's stance that it's not a big deal and that the girlfriend should just get over it is dismissive. In healthy relationships, acknowledging and respecting each other's feelings, even in small matters, is crucial. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid emotional response, and the author's refusal to apologize suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. Even if the author believes he's not wrong, the fact that his words hurt her and he's not willing to express remorse, despite acknowledging the hurt, places the blame on him. So, the answer would be yes, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
