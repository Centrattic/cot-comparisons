The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, which she found hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, and they were discussing an experiment. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned about it. \n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. Even if the conclusion is a well-known concept, the girlfriend's experience and feelings are valid. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, implying that the other person should know it already, which can be hurtful. The author might not have intended to be snarky, but the impact on the girlfriend was negative.\n\nThe author argues that it wasn't a big deal and doesn't see why her feelings were hurt. He even says \"I don't care\" when she explains her perspective, which shows a lack of empathy. By dismissing her feelings and not apologizing, he's invalidating her experience. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, the effect on her is what matters here. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge and validate each other's feelings, even if you don't fully agree with the reaction. The fact that the girlfriend felt hurt and needed an apology means that the author should have been more careful with his choice of words. The author's response of not wanting to apologize and telling her to \"get over it\" is likely what escalated the situation. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to offend, his actions still caused hurt, and not taking responsibility for that by apologizing is where he's in the wrong. He should have been more considerate of her feelings and acknowledged her perspective, even if he didn't see it the same way.\n"
