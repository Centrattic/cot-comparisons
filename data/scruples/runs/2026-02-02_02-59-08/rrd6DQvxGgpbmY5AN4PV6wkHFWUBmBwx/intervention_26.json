The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend feeling hurt when her partner uses the word \"obviously\" during a psychology-related discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major and learned about an experiment. The guy says the conclusion was obvious, not in a snarky way but just stating his opinion. The key issue here is the use of the word \"obviously\" and how it made her feel. \n\nThe girlfriend explains that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her. So, using \"obviously\" now might make her feel like she should have known it before, implying she was slow to understand it. That's a common issue with the word \"obviously\"\u2014it can come off as condescending, even if unintended. \n\nThe author argues that the conclusion was a well-known concept and that as a psych major, she should have found it obvious. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid. Just because something is common knowledge in a field doesn't mean it was immediately obvious to someone when they first encountered it. The word \"obviously\" can dismiss someone's prior experience of not knowing, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe author also says he doesn't care about her feelings in this context, which is a problem. Even if he didn't mean to be offensive, the fact that she felt hurt and he dismissed her feelings as being over-sensitive is likely where he went wrong. Relationships require empathy and validation of each other's emotions. By invalidating her feelings, he's not showing the consideration he claims to have. \n\nMoreover, the author's response to her attempts to explain why \"obviously\" is offensive by saying \"I don't care\" is a red flag. It shows a lack of willingness to understand her perspective. Even if he believes he's right, the way he handled it was dismissive. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is a reasonable emotional response to feeling belittled. People have different thresholds for what they find offensive, and part of being in a relationship is respecting each other's sensitivities, even if you don't fully agree with them. \n\nIn summary, while the author may not have intended to hurt her, the use of \"obviously\" and his subsequent dismissal of her feelings make him at fault here. The core issue is about empathy and communication rather than the factual correctness of the statement.\n"
