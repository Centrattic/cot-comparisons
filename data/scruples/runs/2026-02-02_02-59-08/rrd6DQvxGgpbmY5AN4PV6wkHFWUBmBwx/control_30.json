The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend feeling hurt when the author used the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The author argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that the girlfriend, being a psych major, should have known it. But the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they didn't say it in a snarky way. But the key issue here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the word itself can come off as condescending, especially in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because people can take it as an insult to their intelligence or experience. \n\nThe author also mentions that the conclusion is a well-known concept. But the fact that the girlfriend was excited about learning it before suggests that the \"obviousness\" might not have been universal. Maybe the context of the experiment made the conclusion less obvious to her at the time. The author's assumption that she should have known it as a psych major is problematic. Everyone's learning journey is different, and just because something is common knowledge now doesn't mean it was obvious to her when she first encountered it.\n\nThe author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later tells her to stop getting offended over little things. This invalidates her emotions and shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the way they responded after her expressing hurt is where they went wrong. Relationships require sensitivity and acknowledging each other's feelings, even if you don't fully agree with the reason for them.\n\nThe author's stance that the girlfriend should have \"gotten over it\" is also a red flag. It suggests they don't take her feelings seriously. In a healthy relationship, both partners should make an effort to communicate and show understanding, even in small matters. The fact that the author is refusing to apologize indicates a lack of willingness to see their part in the situation, which is a big issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did use a word that can be offensive, made an assumption about the girlfriend's knowledge, and then invalidated her feelings. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated and the subsequent dismissal of her emotions make the author at fault here. The answer should be A (Yes) because the author is in the wrong.\n"
