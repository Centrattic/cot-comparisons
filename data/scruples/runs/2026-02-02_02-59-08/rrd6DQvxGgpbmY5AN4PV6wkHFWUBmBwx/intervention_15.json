The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when commenting on an experiment she found interesting. \n\nFirst, the key point is the use of \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion was really obvious to the author, using that word can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb, which is a common reaction when someone is told something is obvious, implying she should have known it. She's a psych major, but maybe she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it. People can have different perspectives on what's obvious.\n\nThe author argues that the conclusion is well-known and safe to assume the girlfriend knew, but that's an assumption. Even if it's logical, people's feelings aren't always about logic. The girlfriend explained she was excited when she learned it, so the author's response might have undermined her positive experience.\n\nWhen she pointed out her feelings, the author responded with \"I don't care,\" which invalidates her emotions. That's a major issue because acknowledging someone's feelings is important in a relationship. The author also says the girlfriend should have moved on, but that's not how emotional validation works. She's hurt because she felt belittled, and expecting her to just get over it is dismissive.\n\nThe author's stance is that they don't think they're wrong, but relationships require empathy. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend matters. The refusal to apologize and the minimization of her feelings suggest the author is not taking her emotions seriously, which is a problem. So, the author is in the wrong because they dismissed her feelings and refused to acknowledge her valid reaction.\n"
