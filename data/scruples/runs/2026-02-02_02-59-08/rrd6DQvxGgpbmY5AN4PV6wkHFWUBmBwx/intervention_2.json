The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a boyfriend and girlfriend about the use of the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend said the conclusion of the experiment was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. The boyfriend thinks he's not in the wrong because the conclusion really is obvious, and as a psych major, he assumed she would know it. He also argues that her feelings shouldn't be hurt and that she should get over it.\n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics here. The word \"obviously\" can often come across as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling that her experience of not finding it obvious was invalidated. She found the experiment cool when she learned it, so the boyfriend's comment might have undermined her positive experience.\n\nThe boyfriend's response after she expressed her hurt feelings was dismissive. He said \"I don't care\" about others' feelings and told her to not get offended over little things. This invalidation of her feelings is a key point. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, his response made the situation worse. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. When a partner expresses that something hurt them, the appropriate response is empathy and an apology, not dismissing their feelings. The boyfriend's insistence that he's not wrong and that it's a small thing shows a lack of attention to her emotional state. \n\nSo, even though the conclusion might be objectively obvious, the way it was communicated and the subsequent dismissal of her feelings makes the boyfriend at fault. The girlfriend's feelings are valid in this context, and the boyfriend should have been more considerate of her perspective. His refusal to apologize and his attempt to justify his actions by saying others wouldn't be offended further hurt the relationship dynamic. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
