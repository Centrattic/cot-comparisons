The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a disagreement between a couple about using the word \"obviously.\" \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author said something was \"obvious\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. She felt it was offensive and made her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that it was safe to assume she knew it as a psych major.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about communication and empathy. Using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first encountered the experiment, so his comment made her feel her experience wasn't validated. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings seems dismissive. He says he doesn't care about her feelings in this context, which could be a problem. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, the impact matters. In relationships, validating each other's feelings is important. By not apologizing and telling her to get over it, he's not showing the empathy she might need.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's a psych major doesn't necessarily mean she found it obvious when she learned it. Maybe the experiment had nuances she wasn't aware of yet. The author's assumption that she should have known it's obvious might be an overestimation of her knowledge.\n\nSo, even if the conclusion was common knowledge, the way he communicated it and his reaction to her feelings was problematic. The author should have considered her perspective and apologized, instead of refusing to acknowledge her feelings. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
