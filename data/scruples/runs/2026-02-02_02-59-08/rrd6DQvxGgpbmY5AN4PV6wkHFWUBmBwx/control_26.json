The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting his girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" in their conversation about a psychology experiment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major and learned about the experiment in her class. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and said so, not intending to be snarky. The girlfriend felt offended because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She mentioned that when she first learned about it, it wasn't obvious to her, so hearing him say it was obvious now made her feel like she should have known it all along.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the conclusion is a well-known concept, so it was safe to assume the girlfriend would find it obvious. He doesn't think he was wrong because he didn't mean to offend and even said \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings, which led to accusations of not caring about her feelings. He apologizes but doesn't think he should have to, considering it a small issue.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is about intent versus impact. The author didn't intend to be hurtful, but the impact of his words was hurtful. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not meant that way. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and the author dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she tried to explain why it was offensive. This invalidation likely made her feel unheard and unimportant, which is a mistake.\n\nEven though the author says he cares about her feelings, his reaction of not caring during the discussion could be seen as not valuing her emotional response. Relationships require empathy and understanding, so even if the situation seems minor to him, the fact that she felt hurt is significant. The author should have been more considerate of her perspective and apologized, even if he didn't see the issue initially. Invalidating someone's feelings, even in an argument, is generally not healthy and can lead to more conflict.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he hurt her feelings and didn't properly acknowledge or validate her emotional response, even if he didn't mean to be offensive. The key point is the impact of his words and his dismissive reaction, which contributed to the conflict.\n"
