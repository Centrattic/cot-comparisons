The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for this situation. The scenario is that the author said something was \"obvious\" during a conversation with their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think they're wrong and is asking if they are.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are communication and emotional sensitivity. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which is often seen as dismissive. Even if they didn't mean it snarkily, the impact on the girlfriend was negative. She felt her feelings were hurt because she didn't see the conclusion as obvious when she first learned about it, and she found it cool. The author assumes that as a psych major, she should have found it obvious. But the girlfriend's reaction shows that she didn't perceive it that way.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, emotional sensitivity is important. People can take things differently. The author's stance is that the word wasn't offensive here and that they don't care that the girlfriend felt that way. However, they acknowledge that the girlfriend kept explaining why it was offensive, and the author dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care.\" This could be seen as invalidating her emotions, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nThe author also states that they need the girlfriend to not get offended over little things. This suggests a lack of willingness to validate her feelings, which can lead to more issues. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the fact that they hurt her feelings and aren't willing to apologize might make them at fault. \n\nIn many cases, using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious to the speaker, the listener might feel belittled. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt stupid, which is a legitimate emotional response. The author's refusal to apologize and their insistence that it's not a big deal might indicate a failure to empathize with her feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author might not have intended to be offensive, the impact of their words hurt their partner. The key here is about acknowledging the other person's feelings rather than the intent. Since the author is dismissive of her emotional response and isn't willing to apologize, they might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
