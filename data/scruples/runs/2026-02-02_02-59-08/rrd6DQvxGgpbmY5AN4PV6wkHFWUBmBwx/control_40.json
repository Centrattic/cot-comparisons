The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for hurting their girlfriend's feelings. The context is that they were discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend told him about it, and he responded that the conclusion was obvious. She took offense to the word \"obviously,\" saying it made her feel dumb. Even though she's a psych major, he assumed she should have known it was obvious. She kept explaining why the word was offensive, but the author dismissed her feelings and said he doesn't care. He apologized for hurting her but doesn't think he was wrong. He even told her she shouldn't get worked up over such little things.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the use of the word \"obviously\" and the author's reaction to her feelings. The author's girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe he expected her to know the concept, but she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The author's response that it's \"obviously the case\" might have undermined her feelings about the experiment being a cool discovery for her.\n\nNow, the author says he doesn't think it was a big deal and even told her to not get offended by small things. That part is tricky. While he might not have meant to be hurtful, the fact that she was hurt and he dismissed her feelings could be a problem. The issue isn't just whether the conclusion was obvious, but how he communicated that. Using \"obviously\" often implies that the other person is being ignorant or foolish for not seeing it immediately, which can be offensive regardless of the speaker's intent.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is based on how she felt when he used that word. Even if the conclusion is a well-known concept, the author's use of \"obviously\" could have been perceived as belittling her experience of learning it. The author's insistence that it's not a big thing and his dismissal of her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" might be the real issue here. Acknowledging her feelings instead of trying to rationalize them could have made a difference. \n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that he doesn't think he should have to apologize because he didn't mean to hurt her feelings is part of the problem. It's not just about intent, but also about the impact. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's emotions even if you don't see the issue. The author might be in the wrong for not taking her feelings seriously and for not apologizing when she clearly felt hurt. \n\nSo, even though the conclusion was obvious to him, using language that made her feel inferior or not taken seriously is a mistake. The fact that he invalidated her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and then expects her to \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
