The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their girlfriend something was obvious, and she felt hurt because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the scenario. The author was talking about a psychology experiment with his girlfriend, who is a psych major. He said the conclusion was obvious. She took offense because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. He argues that it was obvious and that she, as a psych major, should have known it.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about communication and sensitivity. Using words like \"obviously\" can sometimes come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. The author might not see it that way, but the effect on the girlfriend is that she felt hurt. The question is whether the author is wrong for that.\n\nThe author says he didn't mean it snarkily, just stating the obvious. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. People can feel invalidated when someone says something is obvious, especially if they didn't see it that way initially. The author is dismissing her feelings by not apologizing and saying he doesn't care about her reaction. That's a problem because respecting someone's feelings is important in a relationship.\n\nThe author also tried to invalidate her feelings by saying it's a small thing and that she shouldn't get worked up. That's a common issue in conflicts where someone doesn't acknowledge the other's emotional response. Even if the author feels it's not a big deal, the fact that it hurt her feelings means he should consider her perspective.\n\nPsych majors might learn complex concepts, but that doesn't mean all conclusions are obvious to them. Each person's experience with the material varies. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious might be misplaced confidence in his own understanding. \n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and his stance that her feelings don't matter in this context show a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't mean harm, the impact is real. In healthy relationships, partners should validate each other's feelings, even if they don't fully agree with the cause. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is wrong because he didn't consider how his words affected her and dismissed her feelings instead of showing empathy and apologizing. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
