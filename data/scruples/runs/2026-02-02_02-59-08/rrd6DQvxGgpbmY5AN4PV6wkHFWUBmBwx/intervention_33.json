The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was sharing something she learned in her class, and the author found the conclusion obvious. He said \"that's obviously the case,\" which led to her feeling hurt. She didn't know it was obvious when she first learned it, so his comment made her feel dumb. \n\nThe author argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it. He doesn't think he was wrong and refuses to apologize, thinking her feelings shouldn't have been hurt. The key here is the use of \"obviously.\" \n\nEven if the conclusion is indeed obvious, the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending. People might feel belittled when someone implies that something wasn't worth explaining because it's \"obvious.\" The girlfriend's reaction is valid because the word made her feel that her experience of learning it wasn't valid. \n\nThe author's stance is that he didn't mean anything by it and that her feelings are overblown. However, in relationships, communication is about how the message is received, not just the intent. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact was hurtful. \n\nHe also mentions not caring and telling her to get over it, which shows a lack of empathy. Acknowledging her feelings and apologizing would have been a more constructive response. By dismissing her feelings, he's invalidating her experience, which is a common mistake in conflicts. \n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it caused hurt. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude towards her feelings make him at fault here. The right approach would have been to apologize and explain that he didn't mean to belittle her experience.\n"
