The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and their girlfriend over using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author said something was obvious, thinking it was a well-known concept. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it, and the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author is defending their use of the word, saying it wasn't meant to be offensive and that they don't think the girlfriend's feelings were valid in this case.\n\nNow, considering communication and empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the impact on the girlfriend is real. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, especially in a relationship where both need to feel respected. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe there's an expectation that she knows these things, but that might not be fair either. The key point is that the author dismissed her feelings, saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing, which can damage trust and emotional safety in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the girlfriend's explanation: they tried to invalidate her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" about her perspective, which is a major red flag. Even if they later said they care about her feelings, the initial dismissal is harmful. Relationships require validating each other's emotions, even if you don't fully understand why they're hurt.\n\nThe author's justification that they don't think it was a big thing shows a lack of consideration for emotional impact. What's obvious to one person might not be to another, and in a discussion, acknowledging that can prevent hurt feelings. The fact that the girlfriend started feeling hurt and needed an apology, but the author refuses to apologize, suggests that the author is not taking responsibility for their part in the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author used a word that the girlfriend found offensive, dismissed her feelings instead of acknowledging them, and refused to apologize. Even if the intention was neutral, the outcome was hurting her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
