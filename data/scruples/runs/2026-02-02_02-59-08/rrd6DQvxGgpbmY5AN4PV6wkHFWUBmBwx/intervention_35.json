The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" which hurt the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. He thought it was obvious and didn't mean to be offensive. He said it in a neutral way, just stating his opinion. But he also assumed that as a psych major, his girlfriend should have found it obvious. That might be a key point. Maybe he underestimated how the word can be perceived, even if not intended that way.\n\nThen, the girlfriend felt hurt and stupid. She explained that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her. So the author's use of \"obviously\" invalidated her experience. Even if the conclusion was well-known, the fact that she found it cool at the time suggests that she valued her learning process, which the author dismissed.\n\nThe author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and argued that it wasn't a big deal. He also told her to not get offended by small things. This response is problematic because it shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, his reaction of not caring and invalidating her feelings makes him at fault. He should acknowledge her feelings instead of dismissing them.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, the impact on his girlfriend matters. The word \"obviously\" can be seen as condescending, especially in a context where the other person is sharing something they learned and took pride in. The author's insistence that he wasn't wrong and that she should move on without addressing her feelings is what's causing the conflict. He should apologize and understand why she felt that way instead of just dismissing her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he failed to consider her feelings, dismissed her valid perspective, and didn't show empathy. The answer should be A.\n"
