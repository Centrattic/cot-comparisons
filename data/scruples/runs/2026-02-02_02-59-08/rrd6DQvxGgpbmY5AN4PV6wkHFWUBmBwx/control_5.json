The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for hurting their girlfriend's feelings when they said an experiment's conclusion was \"obvious.\" The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" was offensive and made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, and the author assumed she would have found it obvious. The author doesn't think they were wrong and even says they don't care that it hurt her feelings, thinking it's a minor issue. The girlfriend is upset because she felt invalidated when the author didn't apologize and dismissed her feelings.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the use of the word \"obviously\" and the author's reaction to the girlfriend's feelings. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the use of \"obviously.\" I know that \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean it to be snarky, the fact that the girlfriend felt hurt suggests that the word had a negative impact. People can interpret things differently, and the author's assumption that because the conclusion is well-known, she should have found it obvious, might not account for her personal experience. She might have found it interesting when she first learned it, and for the author to say it was obvious could undermine her experience.\n\nThen there's the author's reaction afterward. When the girlfriend expressed feeling hurt, the author not only didn't apologize but also dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and that she should just get over it. That's a problem. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the response of invalidating her feelings is definitely part of the issue here. Relationships require empathy and validation, and the author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings, even if they disagree, is likely to escalate the conflict.\n\nThe author's argument is that the conclusion really is obvious and that the girlfriend, as a psych major, should have known that. However, people's experiences with learning things vary. Just because something is well-known doesn't mean someone didn't find it enlightening when they first encountered it. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious overlooks her personal perspective.\n\nAlso, the author's response when the girlfriend tried to explain why \"obviously\" was offensive was dismissive. Instead of listening and empathizing, he invalidated her feelings. This is a common issue in communication where people focus on their own perspective rather than the other person's experience. The author's stance that \"it's not a big thing\" and that the girlfriend is overreacting is problematic because it ignores her valid emotional response.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's feelings even if you don't agree with their interpretation. Saying \"I don't care\" when someone is hurt shows a lack of consideration. The fact that the author is now seeking advice but isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing suggests a lack of willingness to see the other side.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because using \"obviously\" in that context was hurtful, and their subsequent dismissal of the girlfriend's feelings worsened the situation. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated and the reaction to her feelings were inappropriate.\n"
