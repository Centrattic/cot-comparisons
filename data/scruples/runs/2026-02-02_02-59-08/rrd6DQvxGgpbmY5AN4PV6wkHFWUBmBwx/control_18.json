The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author, however, thinks he's not in the wrong because the conclusion really was obvious, and as a psych major, he assumed she would know that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she's studying psychology, which might involve understanding experimental design and concepts. The experiment they discussed was about a well-known concept, which the author found obvious. The key here is that he used the word \"obviously,\" which can often come off as dismissive, even if not intended.\n\nThe author claims he didn't say it in a snarky way, just stated it as a fact. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because the word \"obviously\" can carry an undertone of belittlement. Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious to the author, if the girlfriend first encountered it and didn't find it obvious, his use of the word could undermine her experience of learning it. People process information differently, and what's obvious to one person might not be to another, especially if they're learning it for the first time.\n\nThe author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care,\" which is a problem. Even if he didn't mean to offend her, responding this way invalidates her emotions. The girlfriend felt hurt and needed an apology, but the author refuses, arguing that her feelings shouldn't have been hurt. This shows a lack of empathy on his part. Instead of acknowledging her feelings, he's trying to rationalize his actions and tell her she shouldn't be upset.\n\nAnother point is the author's insistence that it was \"safe to assume it was obvious to her too.\" This suggests he didn't consider that her experience of learning the concept might not align with his understanding of it. Everyone's learning curve is different, and as a partner, he should be more attuned to her emotional state rather than focusing on the logic of the situation.\n\nThe author's response of telling her to \"get over it\" if she got worked up over small things is dismissive and not supportive. Healthy relationships require both parties to respect each other's emotions and communicate effectively. By not apologizing and instead trying to minimize her feelings, the author is not taking responsibility for his part in the conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the author may not have intended to hurt her, his use of the word \"obviously\" and his subsequent dismissal of her feelings contributed to the conflict. The key issue here is about empathy and understanding. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it was harmful. Relationships often involve navigating differences in perspective, and the author's lack of consideration for his girlfriend's feelings places him in the wrong.\n"
