The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting his girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion about a psychology experiment. \n\nFirst, the key issue here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" The author said the conclusion was obvious, which in his view was a well-known concept. However, his girlfriend felt that this made her feel dumb because she hadn't found it obvious when she first learned it. \n\nNow, in interpersonal relationships, especially romantic ones, communication and sensitivity to each other's feelings are crucial. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the word \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive. It might imply that the other person should have known it, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were invalidated when the author didn't acknowledge her perspective and instead tried to justify his comment.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings is also a problem. He insists that he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt and says he \"doesn't care\" when she explains her hurt. This invalidates her emotions, which can escalate the conflict. Even if he apologizes later, his initial dismissal of her feelings suggests a lack of empathy. \n\nHe also tells her she should \"get over it\" and not get offended about small things. This approach is not constructive and can make her feel that her emotions are unimportant. In healthy relationships, both parties should validate each other's feelings and work through conflicts with understanding, not by minimizing the other's experiences.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to hurt her, the impact of his words and his subsequent response definitely contributed to the hurt. Therefore, he is in the wrong here.\n"
