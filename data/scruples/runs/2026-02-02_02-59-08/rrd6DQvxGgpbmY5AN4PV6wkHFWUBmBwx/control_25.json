The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the scenario is that the boyfriend and girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. The girl told him about it, and he said the conclusion was obvious. She felt hurt and offended because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. He argues it was obvious, so he didn't mean to be offensive, and he doesn't think he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl is a psych major, so he assumed she knew the conclusion. But maybe she was still learning, and the experiment was new to her. Using \"obviously\" can imply that the person is being belittled or that what they said is beneath the speaker. Even if he didn't mean to, the word can come off as dismissive. \n\nThe author says he didn't use it in a snarky way, just stating that it was obvious. However, the problem here is that the girlfriend felt hurt. It's not about whether it was actually obvious, but how his comment affected her. People often interpret things differently based on their emotions or experiences. Even if the conclusion is well-known, assuming she should have found it obvious might be condescending. \n\nThe boyfriend then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later invalidates them by not apologizing. He's not acknowledging that his choice of words might have been the issue, even if the content was accurate. The key point is that in relationships, how things are said can be as important as the actual message. \n\nHe also mentions that he wouldn't be offended if she said something similar to him, but that's a bit of a false equivalence. Everyone has different sensitivities. Telling her to \"get over it\" is not helpful and shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, using the word \"obviously\" can be seen as undermining her perspective. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude towards her feelings likely made the situation worse. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings and for not being apologetic when she was hurt.\n"
