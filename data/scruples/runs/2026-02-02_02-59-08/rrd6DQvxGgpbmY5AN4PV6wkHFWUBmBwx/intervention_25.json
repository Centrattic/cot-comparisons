The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author used the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend, which hurt her feelings. The girlfriend felt it was offensive and made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious at the time. The author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, and the author assumed the experiment's conclusion was obvious to her. But she mentioned that when she first learned it, it wasn't obvious. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have implied that she should have known it, which could come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if the conclusion is well-known, the perception matters in relationships.\n\nThe author says they didn't mean it snarkily and that it was safe to assume she would find it obvious. But people's feelings are subjective. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the result was that the girlfriend felt hurt. The key here is empathy. Relationships require considering the other person's perspective and feelings, even if the intention wasn't malicious.\n\nThe author then argues that the girlfriend shouldn't get offended over such little things and doesn't think they need to apologize. That part is concerning because it shows a lack of acknowledgment of her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, and the author's response of \"I don't care\" invalidates her emotions. In a healthy relationship, both partners should validate each other's feelings, even if they don't fully agree.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they do care about her feelings but still think she's wrong to be upset. This contradiction might indicate a lack of emotional intelligence. The fact that the author is now telling her to stop getting offended over small things suggests they're not taking her feelings seriously, which can erode trust and respect in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: even if the author didn't mean harm, their words had a negative impact. The way they responded to her feelings by dismissing them is problematic. In such cases, it's usually better to apologize and show understanding, even if the person's perspective differs. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big deal likely makes them at fault.\n"
