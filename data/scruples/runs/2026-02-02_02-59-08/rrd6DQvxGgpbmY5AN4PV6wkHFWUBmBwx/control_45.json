The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question did something wrong by using the word \"obviously\" when commenting on a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the key point is the use of \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't find it obvious when she learned it, and the author's comment made her feel dumb. The author argues that since it's a well-known concept, it should have been obvious to her as a psych major, and he didn't mean to be dismissive.\n\nBut in communication, intent vs. impact matters. Even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the effect on the other person is still important. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the word \"obviously\" was hurtful, making her feel not smart. The author's response was to say he didn't care about her feelings, which is problematic. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if you think they're overreacting, can damage the relationship.\n\nThe author also mentions not apologizing and telling her to \"get over it,\" which is a sign of not valuing her emotions. In a healthy relationship, both parties should respect each other's feelings, even if they don't see eye to eye. The fact that the author invalidated her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and that she should move on suggests he's not taking her perspective seriously.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the impact was negative. The right approach would be to apologize and acknowledge her feelings, not dismiss them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
