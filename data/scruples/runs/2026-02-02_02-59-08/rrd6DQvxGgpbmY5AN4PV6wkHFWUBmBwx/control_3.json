The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend being hurt when her partner used the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The author argues that the conclusion was obvious, so using \"obviously\" wasn't meant to be offensive and doesn't see why it should be a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The girlfriend felt that the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb, especially since she was a psych major. The author, on the other hand, thinks it's obvious and doesn't understand why the girlfriend is upset. The key points here are about intent versus impact and communication styles.\n\nThe author's main defense is that the conclusion was indeed well-known, so they assumed the girlfriend should have known it. However, even if something is obvious to one person, it might not be to another. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, regardless of the speaker's intent. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated, which is a common issue in communication. The author also didn't take her feelings seriously and dismissed her explanation, which is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge how one's words affect the other, even if the intention wasn't harmful. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that the girlfriend is overreacting could be seen as not caring about her feelings, which contradicts their own statement that they do care. The girlfriend's hurt feelings are real, and the author's response of not caring is hurtful in itself.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact of their words caused hurt. The wrong here lies in the failure to consider the other person's perspective and dismissing their feelings instead of validating them. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
