The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the word \"obviously\" to describe a psychology experiment conclusion, which hurt his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major and learned about the experiment in her class. The guy said the conclusion was obvious, which he thought was a safe assumption because it's a well-known concept. However, she felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb, even though she found it cool when she first learned about it.\n\nThe key point here is about communication and empathy. The word \"obviously\" can be perceived as dismissive, especially in a relationship. Even if the intention wasn't snarky, the effect on the other person matters. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at first and felt invalidated. The author's response was to dismiss her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and telling her to get over it, which likely escalated the conflict.\n\nThe author's stance is that the girlfriend overreacted and that he's not in the wrong. However, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. Even if the conclusion was obvious to him, he should have been more mindful of how his choice of words might affect her. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's dismissal of her emotions is problematic.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. Since the action (using \"obviously\") directly led to hurt feelings and his response was dismissive, it's likely that he's in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes) because he should have been more considerate of her perspective and validated her feelings instead of dismissing them.\n"
