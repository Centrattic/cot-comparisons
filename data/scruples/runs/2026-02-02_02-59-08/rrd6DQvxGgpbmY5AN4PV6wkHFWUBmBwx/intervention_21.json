The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to think through this. The situation is about whether the person who used the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with their girlfriend was in the wrong. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the word made her feel dumb. The author, on the other hand, doesn't think they were wrong because they believe it was a safe assumption that the conclusion was obvious to her as a psychology major.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" In many contexts, \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending. Even if the person didn't intend to be snarky, the word itself can imply that the other person should know something, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend mentioned that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her, so hearing that it's obvious now might make her feel like she should have known it before, hence the hurt feelings.\n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's feelings is also a key point. The author says they don't care about her feelings in this context and even told her to not get offended by little things. This seems dismissive of her emotional reaction. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, not acknowledging her feelings and invalidating them by saying \"I don't care\" is problematic. It's important in relationships to validate each other's emotions, even if you don't agree with the reaction.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that as a psych major, she should have found it obvious. The author might be projecting their own knowledge or perspective onto her. Just because something is well-known or obvious to one person doesn't mean it was to the other. The girlfriend's experience of learning it for the first time and not finding it obvious is valid. The author's comment could be seen as undermining her experience of that learning process.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big thing might be exacerbating the situation. In relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Even if the intention was neutral, the impact on the partner's feelings is real. The girlfriend feeling that the author doesn't care about her feelings when he says \"I don't care\" is a significant issue. It's one thing to not see the problem, but to dismiss her feelings outright is not helpful.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author didn't mean any harm, but the problem here is more about the reaction and how they handled the conflict. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's response to those feelings is what's causing more hurt. The author might not be in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in isolation, but their subsequent responses and lack of empathy are definitely contributing to the conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the initial comment might not have been malicious, the way the author handled the girlfriend's hurt feelings and the dismissal of her emotions is where they are in the wrong. The key is about acknowledging the impact of one's words and being empathetic, even if the intention was good. The author's refusal to validate her feelings and their insistence that it's not a big deal is problematic. So, I think the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
