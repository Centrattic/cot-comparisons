The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when talking to his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend is a psych major and she told him about an experiment. The conclusion was obvious to him, so he said it was \"obviously\" the case. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it, and she felt the word made her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so using the word wasn't wrong. He also says he's sorry but doesn't think he should apologize because he didn't mean to hurt her.\n\nNow, considering communication and empathy in relationships. Using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended. The key here is the impact on the other person, not just the intent. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the effect was that his girlfriend felt belittled. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings is important. When she expressed being hurt, he told her it's not a big deal and that he doesn't care about her feelings in this case. That seems dismissive. Validating someone's feelings is crucial in relationships. By not acknowledging her perspective and instead brushing it off, he's invalidating her experience, which can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author says he wouldn't be offended if she said something similar to him. But he's not her and can't fully understand her feelings. Everyone has different sensitivities. The fact that he used \"obviously\" in a context where she learned the experiment and found it cool at the time suggests that his comment undermined her experience. \n\nEven if the conclusion was obvious to him, it's not about who's right but how to communicate respectfully. People in relationships should consider each other's feelings and avoid language that might be perceived as belittling. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it's not a big thing shows a lack of empathy and willingness to compromise. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author didn't have ill intent, his actions and reactions hurt his girlfriend, and he should take responsibility. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
