The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, a psychology major, who was talking about an experiment. The author responded that the conclusion was obvious, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of the word \"obviously.\" It's a common issue in communication; using such words can come off as dismissive or minimizing someone else's feelings. The girlfriend felt that the author's use of \"obviously\" made her feel unintelligent, even though the author didn't intend to be snarky. The key here is the effect of the words, not just the intention.\n\nThe author argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so it was safe to assume the girlfriend would know it. However, the girlfriend's experience in the class might have been different. She might have been learning it for the first time and found it a revelation. The author dismissing her experience by calling it obvious could be seen as invalidating her learning journey. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the girlfriend's feelings were hurt, which matters in a relationship.\n\nThe author also mentions not caring about the girlfriend's feelings in this context and telling her to get over it. This response is problematic because it downplays her emotional reaction. In relationships, respecting each other's feelings is crucial. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big deal could indicate a lack of empathy. The girlfriend's reaction highlights a sensitivity to how communication affects the other person, which the author is not acknowledging.\n\nAdditionally, the author's stance that the girlfriend should not take things so personally might be a sign of not valuing her emotional needs. Healthy relationships require both partners to validate each other's feelings, even if they don't fully agree with the reaction. The author's response of not caring about her feelings in this situation could lead to more issues if not addressed.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, the use of \"obviously\" and the subsequent dismissal of the girlfriend's feelings likely made her feel belittled. The author's failure to acknowledge her perspective and the refusal to apologize further exacerbate the situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact of their words and not showing sufficient empathy towards their girlfriend's feelings.\n"
