The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend. The situation is they were discussing a psychology experiment, and he said the conclusion was obvious. She felt offended and hurt because he used that word, making her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so he didn't mean to be offensive, and he doesn't think she should be hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious, the use of that word can imply that the other person's lack of prior knowledge is a flaw. People can have different levels of understanding or just be less familiar with a topic at the time. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she's encountered the concept before, but if she didn't recognize it in that context, the author's comment could make her feel like she's not smart enough to know it. That's a common issue with the word \"obviously\"\u2014it can be dismissive.\n\nHe also says he told her it was obvious in a non-snarky way. But intent doesn't always override impact. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, the way he phrased it might have come across as condescending. The fact that she felt hurt is important. The author then dismisses her feelings by saying he doesn't care, which invalidates her experience. That's a problem because when someone shares their feelings, acknowledging them is crucial.\n\nHe further argues that she should just get over it, which is a bit of a red flag. It's not about whether the thing was a big problem, but about respecting her emotions. Relationships require empathy and understanding. If he doesn't apologize, even if he believes he's not wrong, he's not showing empathy. The fact that he doesn't think he should apologize and wants her to move on quickly could lead to more issues, as it's about how you handle conflicts, not just the initial mistake.\n\nThe key points here are the use of \"obviously\" and his response to her feelings. The word can be hurtful regardless of context, and his reaction of invalidation (saying he doesn't care and she should get over it) is definitely in the wrong. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it and then handled her reaction is problematic. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
