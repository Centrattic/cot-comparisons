The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said the conclusion was obvious, which his girlfriend found offensive. She felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author argues that the conclusion is indeed well-known and obvious, so he didn't mean to offend her. However, he dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her not to get offended over small things. \n\nNow, considering communication in relationships, using \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive or condescending, even if unintended. It's a common issue where one person might not realize how their words affect others. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. Even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the impact of his words matters. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings is crucial here. By saying \"I don't care\" and not apologizing, he's invalidating her emotions. Healthy relationships require empathy and the willingness to acknowledge and apologize for hurting someone's feelings, regardless of intent. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it's not a big thing shows a lack of consideration for her perspective. \n\nAdditionally, the author's argument that it's \"obvious\" to a psych major might be his own assumption. Just because he thinks it's obvious doesn't mean it's obvious to everyone, including his girlfriend. People have different educational experiences and levels of prior knowledge. The fact that she found it cool when she first learned it suggests she might still see value in the experiment, even if it's now obvious to him. \n\nIt's important to note that using \"obviously\" can be perceived as belittling, especially in a discussion where someone shares something they found interesting. The girlfriend's sensitivity here is understandable. The author's response to her feelings by dismissing them as being over something \"little\" further compounds the issue. \n\nIn summary, while the author might not have had malicious intent, his words hurt her, and his subsequent dismissal of her feelings is problematic. The key points are about empathy, communication, and the importance of validating a partner's emotions, even when the issue seems trivial to the other person.\n"
