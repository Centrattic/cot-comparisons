The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously,\" which hurt their girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psychology major and mentioned an experiment. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't find it obvious at the time and felt belittled. The author doesn't think they should apologize because they believe the conclusion was indeed obvious and that using \"obviously\" wasn't meant to be dismissive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and empathy. The author might not realize how their words affected the girlfriend. Even if the conclusion was obvious to them, using \"obviously\" can come off as patronizing. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt the comment made her feel dumb. The author's response of not caring and dismissing her feelings (\"I don't think I should have to apologize\") shows a lack of empathy. \n\nEven if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the impact of their words matters. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, and the author's refusal to apologize could damage trust and communication in the relationship. The author should acknowledge her feelings, even if they don't see the issue the same way. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words affected their partner and dismissed her feelings. The answer should be A.\n"
