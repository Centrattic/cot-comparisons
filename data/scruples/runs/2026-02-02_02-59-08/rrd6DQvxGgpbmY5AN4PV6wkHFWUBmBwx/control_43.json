The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend about a psychological experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt and offensive because he used that word, making her feel dumb. The author, however, thinks that the conclusion was obvious and doesn't see why it was a problem. He even says he doesn't care that she's upset and insists he shouldn't have to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship and communication styles. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so she's probably used to discussing complex topics, but maybe she was proud of understanding the experiment when she first learned it. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have undermined her experience. Even though he didn't mean it snarkily, the term \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. People often feel that when someone says something is obvious, it's implying that the person they're talking to should have known it, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe author also mentions that he thinks the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so he assumed she would know. But just because something is obvious to him doesn't mean it's obvious to everyone, even someone in the same field. Everyone has different learning experiences and times when they grasp concepts. For her, it might have been a new or impressive concept when she first encountered it, so his comment could have invalidated her positive experience.\n\nThen there's the part where the author says he doesn't care about her feelings in this context. That's a red flag. Even if he thinks his intention was neutral, the impact on her feelings matters. Relationships require empathy and validation. By dismissing her feelings as being too sensitive, he's not acknowledging her perspective, which can create a rift. He even tells her to get over it, which isn't a good approach for resolving hurt feelings.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy, communication, and the importance of validating another person's feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the result is that his girlfriend was upset. The responsibility isn't just on her to not get offended but on him to consider how his words might affect her. Apologizing isn't about admitting he did something wrong in a malicious way but showing that he cares about her emotions and is willing to make amends.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he failed to validate his girlfriend's feelings and dismissed her perspective, leading to unnecessary hurt. The answer should be A.\n"
