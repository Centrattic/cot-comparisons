The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between a couple where the guy used the word \"obviously\" in a discussion, and the girlfriend felt hurt. The guy argues that he didn't mean to be offensive and that the conclusion was indeed obvious, especially since she's a psych major. He also mentions that he doesn't want to apologize because he thinks it's a small thing, and he even told the girlfriend she should just get over it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points here are communication and empathy. The guy used the word \"obviously,\" which is known to be a common trigger for people because it can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion was actually obvious, the way he phrased it made his girlfriend feel dumb. The fact that she was a psych major doesn't mean she should have known it was obvious. She might have learned it in class but didn't realize the conclusion was so clear. \n\nThe guy's response when she expressed her feelings is important too. Instead of validating her feelings, he dismissed them by saying \"I don't care\" and told her to get over it. That's a major red flag. When someone is hurt, responding with invalidation only escalates the issue. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, his reaction showed a lack of empathy. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's waiting for her to apologize or to move on without addressing her feelings shows that he's not taking her perspective seriously. The girlfriend is trying to communicate that her feelings were hurt, and he's not engaging with that but instead justifying his actions. That's a problem in terms of emotional support and respect in the relationship.\n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, using \"obviously\" in a way that makes her feel dumb was unnecessary. The real issue here is how he responded to her feelings. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude towards her emotions are the main issues. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and failed to respond empathetically.\n"
