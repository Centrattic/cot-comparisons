The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user's girlfriend is a psych major and talked about an experiment. He said the conclusion was \"obvious,\" and she took offense because using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. He argues that since it's a well-known concept, it was safe to assume she knew it. He doesn't want to apologize because he thinks her feelings shouldn't have been hurt, and he told her he doesn't care about people being offended by \"obviously.\" She's upset because he's invalidating her feelings.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and empathy. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge, the way he phrased it might have been insensitive. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she's more aware of how certain words affect people. She felt hurt because he minimized the importance of the concept she found interesting. \n\nThe author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained why the word was offensive is problematic. Invalidating her feelings by saying her reaction is overblown could damage trust. Even if he didn't mean to be snarky, the impact on her matters more than the intention. He should acknowledge her feelings and apologize, even if he doesn't see it the same way. Relationships require compromise and understanding, so not apologizing might be the wrong approach here. \n\nAlso, his statement about not caring if she got offended over little things is harsh. Everyone has different sensitivities, and dismissing her feelings as a \"big thing\" shows a lack of empathy. The fact that he's trying to justify his stance instead of listening to her perspective suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. So, I think he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and refused to apologize when she was clearly hurt.\n"
