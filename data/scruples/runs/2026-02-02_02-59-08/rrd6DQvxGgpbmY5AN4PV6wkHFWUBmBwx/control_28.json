The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend feeling hurt when the author used the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious, which made the girlfriend feel dumb. The author defends their use of the word, arguing that the conclusion is well-known and the girlfriend, being a psych major, should have found it obvious. The girlfriend felt invalidated when the author didn't acknowledge her feelings and even said \"I don't care,\" leading to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt her experience (not finding it obvious at first) was disrespected. The author's response of not caring about her feelings, even if they apologized, probably worsened the situation. \n\nThe author might not see the issue, but the key here is intent vs. impact. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend was hurtful. Relationships require empathy and considering how words affect the other person. The author's insistence that it's a small thing and that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" shows a lack of emotional consideration. \n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated and the subsequent dismissal of her feelings makes the author at fault. The answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
