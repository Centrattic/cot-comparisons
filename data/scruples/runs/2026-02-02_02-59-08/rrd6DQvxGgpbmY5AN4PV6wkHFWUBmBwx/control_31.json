The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author said something was \"obvious\" during a conversation with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. She felt hurt because he used the word \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. The author doesn't think he did anything wrong because he thinks it was obvious, and he's even saying he doesn't care about her feelings here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context better. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she was proud of learning the experiment's conclusion. By calling it obvious, the author might have minimized her experience of learning it. Even if the conclusion is widely known, it's possible she didn't realize it was so straightforward at the time. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, suggesting that if she hadn't seen it as obvious, she's lacking in some way. That's a common issue with that word in communication.\n\nThe author argues that it was safe to assume she knew it was obvious. But just because it's a well-known concept doesn't mean everyone grasps it immediately. The key here is how the statement made her feel. The author is being dismissive of her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and not acknowledging her hurt. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, the impact on her is still valid. Relationships require empathy and considering how your words affect others, even if you don't see the issue.\n\nAlso, when the author says he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt, that's invalidating her experience. It's not about whether the person is right or wrong in their feelings, but about respecting them. The fact that he's unwilling to apologize further suggests a lack of consideration for her emotions. Even if he's sorry for hurting her, not acknowledging her right to feel that way is problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend might have overreacted, but the author's response of telling her to get over it is unhelpful. In healthy relationships, both parties should work through such issues with understanding and compromise, not by dismissing each other's feelings. So the author is probably in the wrong because he failed to consider her perspective and invalidated her emotions, even if unintentionally.\n"
