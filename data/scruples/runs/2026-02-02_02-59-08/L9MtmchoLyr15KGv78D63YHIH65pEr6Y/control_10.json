Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides of the situation. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and this kind of thing happens often. They had a conversation earlier where the author warned her they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time, but she said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she's still not ready, her clothes are only slightly dry, and he gets upset, raises his voice, and leaves her at 4:00. \n\nSo, the key points here are: time management issues from Jill, prior warnings from the author, the author's frustration leading to yelling, and the decision to leave her behind. \n\nNow, considering the question of who's in the wrong. The author left his fianc\u00e9e in a potentially embarrassing situation because he was frustrated with her not being ready. While he did give her warnings, leaving her naked and without dry clothes might have been harsh. Also, raising his voice could be seen as part of the problem. Jill is upset because he was impatient and yelled. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might have been trying to be responsible by ensuring they were on time, but his method of handling it\u2014leaving her behind\u2014might not have been the best approach. However, Jill could be at fault for not managing her time and not taking the warnings seriously. \n\nBut the core issue here is whether the author's actions were acceptable. Leaving a partner in such a state could be seen as abandonment or not considering her feelings. Even if he was frustrated, leaving her might have been an overreaction. On the other hand, if she had known the clothes would be dry and didn't prepare accordingly, maybe she's partially responsible. \n\nI think the author made a mistake in leaving her, especially after raising his voice. It's a judgment call, but in relationships, actions like leaving someone behind when they're unprepared can be seen as harsh. The author might have handled it better by staying and helping her or at least ensuring she wasn't left in an uncomfortable situation. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). However, there's a nuance because Jill also contributed by not managing her time. But the question is about the author's actions specifically. Since he left her, which is a significant action, I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
