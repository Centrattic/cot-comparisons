Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author, let's call him Will, is asking if he's in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home when they were about to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. Jill was still getting ready at 3:45, her clothes were slightly damp, and he left after waiting until 4:00.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. From Will's side, he's clearly stressed about their tendency to be late. He mentioned they have this conversation often, which suggests it's a recurring issue. He made a heads-up about the departure time, expecting her to start an hour and a half earlier. When she wasn't ready by the latest possible time, he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. He argues that she's being defensive because he thinks she's in the wrong.\n\nOn Jill's side, she's upset because she feels Will was impatient, assured her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling. She might feel that he didn't trust her to get ready on time and that his reaction was harsh. Also, he left her at home, which could be seen as abandoning her in an embarrassing situation or not supporting her.\n\nThe key points here are communication, expectations, and the actual actions. Will gave a clear warning, but maybe he didn't give her enough time considering the laundry might not have dried. He did wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the latest departure time, before leaving. However, raising his voice in frustration is a problem. Yelling can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was still naked and clothes were slightly damp complicates things. If they left at 4:00, they might have arrived on time, but if he left before 4:00, that's the issue. The timeline isn't entirely clear. When he said he'd meet them there at 4:00, did he have to leave immediately to make it by 4:00? If the drive is 30 minutes, they would need to leave by 3:30 to arrive by 4:00. But the wedding starts at 4:30, so maybe they could have left a bit later? Maybe the drive time isn't exactly 30 minutes, or there were traffic considerations. \n\nBut the main conflict here is about time management and communication. Will expected her to start earlier, but maybe he should have been more flexible or helped her get ready once the laundry was done. Yelling is a poor way to handle stress and shows a lack of control. Leaving her might have been his way to be on time, but it could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were going together. However, if they missed the wedding entirely because she wasn't ready by 3:45, that's a different scenario. \n\nAnother angle: the author's actions led to a conflict. He left her at home, which could be considered a breach of their commitment to each other. In a relationship, supporting each other is important. But Jill's repeated issues with time management might be the root cause. Still, Will's decision to leave and his raised voice are problematic. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he left her before they had to depart to make the event, maybe he's at fault for not waiting. But if the event was just starting and they had time to arrive before the ceremony, perhaps not. However, the act of leaving her at home might be seen as abandonment, especially if she wasn't fully ready yet. \n\nAlso, he told her the clothes would be dry, but if they were slightly damp, maybe he was wrong in his estimation, contributing to the problem. That could be another point where he's not entirely right. \n\nIn summary, while Jill's time management is an issue, Will's yelling and leaving her might have been unkind and unnecessary. He should have handled the situation with more patience and support, even if frustrated. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a balance. Maybe both are at fault? The question is about the author specifically. Given that he left her and raised his voice, even if she's responsible for the time, his actions were perhaps too harsh. So AITA is a common scenario where people often discuss both sides, but the main question is about the author's accountability. I think the answer is A because his actions (yelling and leaving) were disrespectful, even if the situation was tense.\n"
