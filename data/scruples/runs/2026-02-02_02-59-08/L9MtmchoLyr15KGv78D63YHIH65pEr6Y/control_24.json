Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. But by 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author waited until 4:00, then left, which made Jill upset.\n\nThe author says Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often get late. He raised his voice in frustration, which he admits was a wrongdoing. He left her at home to avoid being late to the wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are the time management issue, the author's impatience, and the emotional response (yelling). The wedding is a significant event where punctuality is usually expected. The author tried to give a clear time frame, but Jill didn't meet it. However, leaving her unready could be seen as abandoning her, which might be harsh. But the author also wanted to be respectful to the hosts and guests by not being late.\n\nJill is mad because she feels the author was impatient, assured the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling. The author thinks she's in the wrong and being defensive.\n\nI need to consider if the author was wrong to leave. On one hand, maybe the author should have found a solution instead of leaving, like helping her get ready or adjusting their approach. On the other hand, Jill's consistent time issues led to the problem. The author raised their voice, which is a mistake, but the main action is leaving.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author gave a heads-up about the time, but maybe didn't check in more frequently. However, Jill also didn't take the initial warning seriously. The fact that the author left might have been a reaction to the stress, but it's a bit drastic. The author could have tried to resolve it differently, but given Jill's repeated tardiness, maybe it's understandable.\n\nSo, the author is partly in the wrong for yelling, but the act of leaving might be excusable if they were trying to respect the event's timing. However, leaving Jill unprepared could be seen as not supporting her, even if she's late. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is A (yes) because leaving her there might have been disrespectful or hurtful, but the author's intention was to avoid being late. Hmm. Alternatively, if the author tried to manage the time and she didn't meet the deadline, maybe they had no choice. But it's a wedding, so showing up late is also bad. The author left to avoid being late, but that resulted in Jill being left behind. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not finding another solution. Or not, if the time pressure was real and they couldn't wait longer.\n\nAlso, the author's admission of yelling suggests they acknowledge some fault. But the main question is about leaving Jill. In the end, it's a judgment call. Some might say the author was wrong to leave, others might sympathize with the time constraints. I think the answer is A because the author left their fianc\u00e9e unprepared and without support, even if the intention was to be on time. However, given the situation, maybe it's a mix. But the options are A or B. Since the author left her and she was in the middle of getting ready, that's a problem. They might be in the wrong for that action.\n"
