Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: They had a prior conversation about leaving at 3:45 PM to arrive on time. The author warned her multiple times, and Jill said she'd be fine. But when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, her clothes were still damp, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice and left at 4:00 PM, 15 minutes before the wedding start time. \n\nNow, considering the factors. The author's main issue is that he values punctuality and finds lateness disrespectful. He tried to communicate the timeline clearly, and when Jill didn't meet the deadline, he made a choice. However, he raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, even if just in frustration. That could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a relationship context.\n\nOn Jill's side, she might have misjudged her time, but the author did give her a clear deadline. If he was aware of her tendency to mismanage time, maybe he should have allowed more buffer time. But he set the time and she didn't meet it. However, leaving her alone might have been an overreaction. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he didn't want to arrive during the ceremony, so leaving early to avoid being late makes sense. But by 4:00 PM, he's already 30 minutes before the ceremony, which is probably early enough. Yet, he left her alone, which could be seen as abandoning her in a stressful situation. \n\nThe key points are communication, the escalation of frustration (yelling), and the decision to leave. While the author had a valid concern about punctuality, the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might cross into being inconsiderate. Relationships require compromise, and maybe the author should have stayed to help or found another solution instead of leaving. Alternatively, Jill might have known her own time management issues and should have prepared earlier. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of leaving her at home because she wasn't ready by the set time could be seen as holding her accountable. However, the yelling and the decision to leave without ensuring she was okay might tip the balance. So, depending on perspective, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the yelling and the abrupt decision, but Jill also shares some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the situation, it's a bit of a gray area, but the yelling and the action of leaving could be seen as his fault. So answer A (Yes) might be the case here.\n"
