Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is presented through an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author, let's call him Will, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill were supposed to leave by 3:45 PM to make it to a 4:30 PM wedding. Will had earlier warned Jill to start her clothes early because of the time. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding alone. Now, Jill is upset because Will called her clothes dry when they weren't, yelled, and called him impatient. Will thinks she's in the wrong for being late and defensive.\n\nSo, the main points of contention here are: 1) Whether Will was justified in leaving Jill, 2) The yelling, and 3) The argument over the clothes drying time.\n\nFirst, let's consider time management and communication. Will had given Jill a specific time to start her clothes (around 1:30 PM, as the conversation started) and emphasized the need to leave by 3:45. Jill said she would be fine. Will might have trusted her to manage her time, but when she didn't, he made a decision to leave to avoid being late. However, leaving someone alone at home, especially when they're not ready, could be seen as abandoning them in a vulnerable state (she was naked). That's a red flag. \n\nThe act of yelling is another point. Raising one's voice in frustration can be seen as disrespectful or aggressive, even if it's due to stress. That's a valid criticism from Jill's side. The argument here is whether the frustration was justified or if it was an overreaction.\n\nThe clothes part: Will told Jill the clothes would be dry if she started in time. However, since they didn't, the clothes were slightly damp. Will might have underestimated the drying time, or Jill might have miscalculated. Either way, the expectation wasn't met, leading to conflict. \n\nNow, in relationships, especially with someone you're engaged to, communication and support are key. Will's decision to leave could be seen as prioritizing punctuality over his partner's needs. However, showing up late to an event is considered impolite in many social contexts. On the other hand, leaving Jill in that state could be seen as neglectful or inconsiderate.\n\nPossible angles: \n- Will's frustration is understandable, but his response (yelling and leaving) was harsh.\n- Jill's time management is a recurring issue, but she's still a fianc\u00e9e, and Will could have tried helping her instead of leaving.\n- The situation might have called for a compromise, like leaving with Jill even if they were going to be late, to support her and then explain the delay.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. However, the act of leaving someone in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready) might tip the scales. The yelling adds to the problem. While time management is important, the way Will handled the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if Jill is at fault for mismanaging her time, Will's actions (yelling and leaving her alone) might make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
