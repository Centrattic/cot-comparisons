Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They mention that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, and they often have conflicts about punctuality. The situation here is that they agreed to leave by 3:45 PM to get to the wedding on time (which starts at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away). Jill said she'd be ready, but at 3:45, she's not, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. The author gets frustrated, raises their voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM, telling Jill they'll meet there.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication, time management, and the decision to leave. The author had previously warned Jill about the time, and she assured them she'd be ready. The author then waited until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time. However, leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home could be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a relationship. The author's frustration led them to raise their voice, which is a point against them, but the main question is about leaving.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests, which is understandable. On the other hand, leaving a fianc\u00e9e alone, even in frustration, might be seen as selfish or not supportive. Relationships often require compromise, and maybe the author should have handled the situation differently, like staying with Jill to help her get ready instead of leaving. However, the author's intention was to avoid being late, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut the act of leaving without ensuring Jill was okay could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9e might feel abandoned or disrespected. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready on time, the author's decision to leave might not be the right approach. They could have tried to de-escalate the situation or find another solution instead of walking out. The fact that they raised their voice adds to the tension, but the main issue is the choice to leave.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at both sides. The author had a valid reason to be upset about being late, but their response might be seen as harsh. The fianc\u00e9e's repeated issues with time management are part of the problem, but the author's reaction could also be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might be that the author is somewhat at fault for how they handled the situation, even if the fianc\u00e9e made the initial mistake. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
