Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The couple had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM to arrive on time for a 4:30 PM wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, was still getting ready at 3:45, her clothes were slightly damp, and the author left at 4:00 PM. He raised his voice in frustration before leaving. \n\nHe argues that Jill is defensive and in the wrong because of her time management. She's upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and yelled. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author tried to set a clear deadline multiple times. He had warned her about the time needed. Leaving might have been a way to avoid being late, which he values. However, raising his voice and leaving her alone when she wasn't ready could be seen as harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't meet the agreed-upon time, which caused the conflict. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach led to her being left behind. \n\nIn conflicts like this, communication and empathy are key. While Jill's time management is a problem, the author's solution of leaving might have been too abrupt. He could have tried to find another solution, like adjusting the time together or helping her get ready, instead of leaving her. His anger and the act of leaving alone might have been hurtful, even if the root issue was her being unprepared. \n\nSo, while Jill's actions contributed to the problem, the author's response might have been inconsiderate. He needs to take responsibility for his tone and the decision to leave without support. Therefore, he's partially in the wrong.\n"
