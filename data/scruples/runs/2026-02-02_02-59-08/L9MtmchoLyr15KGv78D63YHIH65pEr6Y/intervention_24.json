Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, let's call him Will, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill were supposed to leave by 3:45 PM to get to a wedding on time. Jill didn't have her clothes dry and wasn't ready by then. Will raised his voice in frustration, waited until 4:00 PM, then left her at home. Now Jill is upset, and Will thinks she's being defensive.\n\nSo, the main points here are about punctuality, communication, and conflict resolution. Will seems to value being on time, which is understandable, especially for a formal event like a wedding. Jill, on the other hand, has a history of poor time management, which might be a recurring issue in their relationship.\n\nFrom Will's perspective, he set a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and reminded her earlier to start getting ready. He waited past the deadline, which shows some flexibility, but eventually decided to leave alone. He might believe he was acting in the best interest of not being late, hence not wanting to be disrespectful to the hosts or the couple getting married.\n\nHowever, there are things to consider. Raising his voice and then leaving her alone could be seen as harsh. Even if she's responsible for her own readiness, the way he handled the situation might have escalated the conflict. Also, leaving her alone at home might be seen as abandoning her, which is not supportive in a relationship. \n\nJill's side is that she wasn't ready, perhaps because the laundry wasn't dry as Will had told her it would be. The story mentions Will said the clothes would be dry by the time they needed to leave, but maybe that wasn't the case. If he made a promise about the laundry that didn't hold up, that's on him. His anger might have been a reaction to her not being ready, but if his initial information was incorrect, that's a point against him.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. Jill's time management is an issue, but Will could have approached it differently. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have tried to find a solution, like calling someone for a ride, or being more understanding and helping her get ready. His choice to leave might be seen as prioritizing his own standards over her feelings and the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are: did he have a right to leave her alone? Was his reaction (raising his voice) justified? Did he give her a fair chance? He waited 15 minutes past the deadline, which is some time, but the method of handling it might be the issue. Also, the fact that he's her fianc\u00e9, so their relationship is more serious, and such a conflict could have a bigger impact.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who leaves someone behind for being late is often seen as the asshole if it's done in a harsh way. The combination of yelling and then leaving might tip the scales towards him being in the wrong. However, if the issue is about respecting commitments (the wedding), maybe there's a balance. But given that it's their own fianc\u00e9e, and the method of handling it was confrontational, the answer might lean towards AITA.\n"
