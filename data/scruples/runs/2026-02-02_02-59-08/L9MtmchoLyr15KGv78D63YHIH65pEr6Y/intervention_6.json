Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are:\n\n- They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, about 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. She agreed but didn't get ready on time. At 3:45, she was still getting dressed, clothes slightly damp from the dryer. The author got upset, raised their voice (which they admit was wrong), and by 4:00 PM, left to go to the wedding alone. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry in time, and yelled at her.\n\nThe author claims Jill knows she's in the wrong, but he's asking if he is in the wrong for leaving her behind.\n\nSo, the main issues here are time management and communication. The author set a strict deadline (3:45 PM) based on the event time, but Jill didn't account for possible delays (like the laundry not drying in time). She might have underestimated the time needed. The author's frustration led to raising their voice, which is a mistake. However, leaving her at home because they were going to be late is another point.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he did set the deadline, but maybe he didn't give her enough margin for error. He told her to start early, which she did, but the laundry not being dry was a variable he might have overlooked. However, he was trying to be on time and polite, which is reasonable. On the other hand, leaving her in that situation could be seen as abandoning her, especially since she was in the middle of getting ready. Also, the fact that he raised his voice adds to the tension.\n\nJill's perspective is that he was impatient and didn't take responsibility for ensuring her clothes would dry. But she also didn't manage her time properly. The author is caught in a dilemma between being on time and supporting his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. The author's mistake might be in not finding a middle ground, like staying a little longer and missing the wedding slightly, rather than leaving her alone. But he did acknowledge he raised his voice, showing some self-awareness. \n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the answer isn't black and white. The author might be partially at fault for the way he handled the situation, especially leaving her there. But Jill's time management issues also played a role. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. Since he took responsibility for his outburst, but the action of leaving her might have been harsh. So, perhaps the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because leaving her in that state without support isn't ideal, even if he wanted to be on time. There might have been a better way to handle it, like staying with her until they could leave together, even if slightly late, and explaining the situation to the hosts.\n"
