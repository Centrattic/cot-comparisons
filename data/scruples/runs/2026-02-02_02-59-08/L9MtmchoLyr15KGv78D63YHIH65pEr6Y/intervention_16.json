Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves a time management issue where Jill didn't get ready on time despite being warned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentioned that Jill often has trouble budgeting her time, leading to them being late or him getting stressed. He had told her to start preparing two hours in advance to make the 3:45 PM departure, but she wasn't ready until after 4 PM. He got upset, raised his voice, and left without her. Now Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean. The author believes Jill is defensive and in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility for punctuality in a relationship. The author tried to set a clear timeline, but Jill didn't adhere to it. However, the author's response was to leave her, which might seem harsh. The question is whether his actions were justified or if he overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, showing up late to events can be considered rude, and the author wanted to be on time. He did give a heads-up about the time, so he's trying to be considerate. But he raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, making the situation more about his reaction than just the lateness. Leaving without her might have been a way to avoid being late, but it could also be seen as abandonment, especially in a committed relationship where partners are expected to support each other even in stressful situations.\n\nThen there's the issue of the laundry. He told her to start now if she needed two hours, but maybe he should have been clearer about the drying time. If her clothes were slightly damp, perhaps he could have adjusted his instructions instead of just leaving. Also, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe there's a need for a discussion about how to handle time management issues rather than reacting impulsively.\n\nBut the author argues that Jill is defensive. Maybe she does have some responsibility here. However, even if she's at fault for being late, the way the author handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014could be problematic. Relationships often require compromise and understanding. If this is a recurring issue, the best approach might be to talk about it calmly and find a solution together, not to escalate things by leaving an event due to her being unprepared.\n\nAnother angle: Weddings are important events, and the author wanted to be there on time. But leaving Jill behind might make her feel neglected or not respected. Even if he's stressed about time, making her go alone after she's not ready, especially when she's his fianc\u00e9e, could be hurtful. Maybe he should have given her a chance to get ready while he waited, even if it meant arriving a bit late, or perhaps helped her to speed up instead of just leaving.\n\nAlso, the fact that they had this conversation multiple times before suggests that maybe the author should have found a better way to handle the situation, considering her previous behavior. Yelling adds to the conflict and could be seen as disrespectful, which might have contributed to the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while Jill's time management is an issue, the author's reaction\u2014raising his voice and leaving her\u2014seems like a mistake. It's important to address the problem without being harsh, especially in a relationship where mutual support is expected. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
