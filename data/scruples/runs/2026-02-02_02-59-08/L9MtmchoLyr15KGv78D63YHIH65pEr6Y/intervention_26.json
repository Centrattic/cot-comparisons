Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The story says Jill isn't good at time management, and they often have conflicts about being late. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. When 3:45 came, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were damp, and the author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wanted to be on time, which is understandable. Telling someone you'll be there by a certain time and then being late can be seen as inconsiderate. But the author left before the wedding time, not during it. However, they did raise their voice, which could be seen as yelling, hence being \"mean.\" \n\nJill might feel that the author didn't trust her to get ready on time, even though she had been warned. The author's message at 1:30 was a heads-up about leaving at 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, so maybe she thought she had time. The author waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the planned departure but gives 30 minutes to reach the wedding. Maybe the author didn't want to be late to the actual event, so leaving earlier was a buffer. But by leaving at 4:00 instead of waiting for her, the author caused her to miss the wedding part. \n\nThe key points here are the author's frustration leading to yelling, which is a form of communication that can be hurtful. Then, leaving Jill behind instead of helping her get ready, even if she's late, could be seen as abandonment. The author might have overreacted by taking the threat of being late a bit too seriously. But Jill also didn't manage her time as instructed. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Yelling might have been unnecessary even if Jill was not following the plan. The author could have handled the frustration without raising their voice and instead tried to assist Jill or adjust the plan if possible. Leaving her in the state described (naked, clothes slightly damp) might be harsh. The author's action of leaving could be seen as selfish, prioritizing punctuality over supporting their partner, which is important in a relationship. \n\nSo, considering these factors, the author made a mistake by yelling and by leaving Jill behind. While time management is an issue, the way the author handled it\u2014using a raised voice and leaving\u2014might be inconsiderate. Jill's reaction (being mad, feeling defensive) could be a result of the emotional response, not just the lateness. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
