Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9, let's call him Tom, mentions that Jill (his fianc\u00e9e) often has trouble managing her time, leading to them being late. For this wedding, which starts at 4:30, they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. He told her that earlier, and she said she'd be fine. But at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. He gets frustrated, yells, and leaves by 4:00.\n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and was mean. The author thinks she's being defensive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: communication, expectations, and the action taken (leaving her). \n\nTom set a clear deadline (3:45) and gave her a heads-up. Jill, knowing her own tendency to be unprepared, still said she'd be okay. Tom waited past 3:45 until 4:00, which is 15 minutes. He left her at home to go to the wedding alone. \n\nNow, is Tom in the wrong? Well, he did set a time and gave her a heads-up, which shows he was trying to be responsible. But when she wasn't ready, he got frustrated and raised his voice. Yelling isn't great, but the main issue is leaving her. \n\nHowever, leaving her at home because she wasn't ready\u2014especially after multiple instances of her being unprepared\u2014could be seen as a justified decision to respect the commitments they have. That said, maybe there was a better way to handle it. For example, waiting a bit longer, helping her get ready, or at least ensuring she has a way to get to the wedding, even if he left. \n\nBut Tom chose to leave, and she was left behind. The question is whether that's his fault. On one hand, he tried to set boundaries. On the other, he didn't consider that maybe her laundry wouldn't dry in time despite her assurance. Also, yelling is a problem because it's hurtful. \n\nBut the core issue is that Jill knew her own habits and still agreed to be ready by the time he set. Tom's action of leaving could be seen as taking responsibility for their punctuality. However, he could have handled the situation more compassionately. \n\nIn a relationship, communication is key. Maybe Tom should have discussed the issue of time management more privately, without public shaming. But in terms of the act of leaving her, if they both agreed to leave at 3:45 and she wasn't ready, then Tom had a right to prioritize the commitment they had. However, he also should have ensured she could still attend the event, perhaps by driving separately or finding another way. \n\nBut he just left her there, which might have been harsh. However, given that the wedding is a significant event, and he didn't want to be late, his actions might be seen as a necessary compromise. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is partly in the wrong for raising his voice and not considering that her laundry might not dry in time, but the main action of leaving her might be justified. However, the way he handled it (yelling and leaving without ensuring she had a ride) might make him more at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the act of leaving her is wrong. If the event was important and they couldn't be late, and she knew the time, then leaving might be seen as acceptable. However, if she was left without a way to get to the wedding, that's a problem. The story says he left her at home, but it doesn't mention if she had a way to go. If she did, maybe it's okay. If not, then he's in the wrong. \n\nSince the story doesn't clarify if she could get there herself, it's ambiguous. But given that they were going to the wedding together, leaving her might have left her stranded. That would make Tom at fault. However, if they had discussed beforehand that she could take a different route or had other transportation, maybe not. \n\nIn the absence of that info, the key points are: Tom set a time, she assured she'd be ready, she wasn't, he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. The answer hinges on whether leaving her was the right choice. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who leaves is seen as in the wrong if it's done in a hurtful way without considering the other person's circumstances. Here, Tom's frustration and yelling add to the issue. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, Tom's response was harsh. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he reacted in a hurtful way (yelling) and left her alone, possibly without a way to attend the event. However, if she had her own transportation, it's different. But since it's not mentioned, assuming she didn't, he's more at fault.\n"
