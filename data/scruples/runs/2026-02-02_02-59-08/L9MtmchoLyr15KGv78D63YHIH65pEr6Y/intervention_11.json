Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 leaving his partner, Jill, at home because they were running late to a wedding. The author, let's call him Will, wanted to be on time and tried to set a deadline, but Jill wasn't ready, so he left her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Will mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time and they often get late or he gets stressed. He thinks it's rude to be late, so he set a clear time to leave. Jill said she'd be fine, but ended up not being ready. When the time came, he raised his voice in frustration and left her. Now, she's upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean.\n\nSo the main points are: Did Will overreact by leaving her? Was he being unreasonable in his expectations? Did he handle the situation poorly?\n\nOn one hand, Will tried to give a heads-up about the time. He probably wanted to be respectful to the wedding guests and didn't want to be late. Leaving at 3:45 was his plan. But Jill wasn't ready, so he left. However, he raised his voice, which is a negative aspect. Yelling adds to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have overestimated her ability to get ready in time. If she knew the time constraints, maybe she should have started earlier. But Will told her the clothes would be dry by 3:45, but they were only slightly damp. Maybe he should have checked if they were actually dry before leaving. Also, leaving her might make her feel abandoned or unimportant compared to being on time.\n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, communication is key. Perhaps Will should have discussed the issue more calmly, maybe offered help or compromised. Instead of leaving her, maybe he could have waited a bit more or found another solution. His frustration led to an impulsive action that hurt her feelings.\n\nAlso, considering that they're engaged, the expectation might be higher in terms of supporting each other. Leaving her alone in such a situation might seem harsh, especially if she was already stressed about getting ready. She might feel that he prioritized punctuality over her, which could be a bigger issue than just being late.\n\nHowever, Will's intention was to be respectful to others, which is understandable. But his method of handling the situation\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be what's causing the problem. The question is whether his actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I The Asshole), the community often looks at who had the reasonable expectations and how the conflict was handled. If Will was reasonable in setting a time but handled it poorly with yelling and leaving, that's part of the issue. Jill's defensiveness might also be a reaction to feeling blamed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author (Will) might be at least partially in the wrong for not handling the situation calmly and for leaving her, but Jill also shares some responsibility for not managing her time better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he chose to leave her and raised his voice, those actions likely contribute to him being in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
