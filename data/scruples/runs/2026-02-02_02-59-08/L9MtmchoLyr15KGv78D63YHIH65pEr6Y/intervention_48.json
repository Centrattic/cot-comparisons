Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nSo the author, let's call him Will, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill were going to a wedding that started at 4:30 PM. The wedding is 30 minutes away. At 1:30 PM, Will mentions doing laundry and asks Jill if she needs anything. She says she\u2019ll put her clothes in and asks if they\u2019ll be dry by the time they need to leave. Will says probably, but up to her. He sets a deadline of 3:45 PM to leave latest. Jill says she'll be fine.\n\nThen at 3:45 PM, Jill is still naked, clothes are slightly damp, not ready. Will gets upset, raises his voice, waits till 4:00 PM, says he can't wait longer and leaves. Now Jill is mad, says he was impatient, didn't tell her the clothes would dry, and was mean. Will thinks she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user says they think Will is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether Will is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. Will set a deadline, Jill didn't meet it. He raised his voice, which is a form of yelling or being harsh. Then he left her at home, went to the wedding without her. \n\nOn one hand, Jill might have misjudged how long things would take. She might have thought the laundry would dry in time, but maybe it didn't. She could be responsible for her own timeline. However, maybe Will didn't check in more after their initial conversation. He told her to start the laundry if she needed two hours, which implies he gave her a time frame. But maybe he didn't follow up, assuming she could handle it. \n\nHe raised his voice in frustration. That's a valid point; yelling can escalate tensions. Then leaving her at home when she's not ready. While he did wait until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes after the deadline, maybe that's reasonable. But the act of leaving her unprepared is where it gets tricky. If they were supposed to go together, leaving her behind might be considered abandoning her, even if she's not ready. \n\nHowever, the wedding is a time-sensitive event. Arriving late is considered disrespectful, as Will mentioned. He might have wanted to be respectful to the couple. But Jill might feel hurt or embarrassed that he left her. \n\nAnother angle: communication. Did Will make it clear that the timeline was strict? He set a deadline, but maybe he didn't help Jill manage her time. Maybe he should have assisted or checked in more. Conversely, Jill should have managed her time better. \n\nThe fact that they have this kind of conversation often might indicate a recurring issue. If Will has been pointing this out before, maybe Jill should be more proactive. But if Will is always stressed about being late, maybe he needs to find a way to support her better rather than reacting harshly. \n\nRaising his voice is a problem. Even if frustrated, yelling is not constructive. Then leaving her without ensuring she gets there, maybe she could get there later, but the wedding might not wait. \n\nSo, is Will in the wrong? He left her because she wasn't ready, despite knowing this is a common issue. He might have failed to support her in managing her time, instead of being understanding. His yelling adds to the problem. However, the main issue is leaving her. If the plan was to go together, then leaving her might be the wrong move. But if the priority was attending the wedding on time, he might feel justified. \n\nBut in a relationship, supporting each other is key. Leaving her when she's not ready might be seen as abandoning her, even if she made mistakes. So perhaps Will is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation with more support, and his actions (yelling and leaving) caused more hurt. \n\nAlternatively, if he had tried to help her get ready after she was behind, but she refused, then leaving might be understandable. But he didn't mention trying to assist. He just waited, got frustrated, yelled, and left. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is A, that he is in the wrong. He could have been more patient, not yelled, and found another solution instead of leaving her. His actions were reactive rather than proactive. Jill's responsibility in time management is part of it, but Will's handling of the situation is also at fault.\n"
