Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their fianc\u00e9e (Jill) were supposed to leave by 3:45 for a wedding starting at 4:30. The author warned Jill to start getting ready early because they've had issues with her time management before. When the time came, Jill wasn't ready, clothes were only slightly dry, and the author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nThe author feels they're right because they wanted to be on time and Jill's behavior led to this. Jill is upset because the author yelled, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and left her behind.\n\nConsidering the facts: The author did raise their voice, which is a form of yelling, which is unkind. Leaving a partner behind, even if they're late, can be seen as abandonment in a stressful situation. Also, the author might have overestimated the drying time, leading to tension. However, the author's intention was to be respectful to the event by not being late, which is understandable. Jill's repeated time management issues contributed to the problem, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. \n\nThe key points are the raised voice and leaving without a plan to return. If the author left and immediately went to pick her up, maybe it's different, but in this case, it seems they just left her there. So while Jill's behavior is a factor, the author's actions (yelling, leaving without a backup plan) cross into being in the wrong. So I think A is the answer here.\n"
