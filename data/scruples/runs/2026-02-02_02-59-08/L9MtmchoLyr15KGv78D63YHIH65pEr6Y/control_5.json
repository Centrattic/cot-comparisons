Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both are going to a wedding that starts at 4:30 PM. They live 30 minutes away, so they need to leave by 3:45 PM latest. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, was doing laundry for the wedding outfit. The author told her to start early to avoid being late. At 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. The author gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM, saying he can't wait anymore.\n\nHe's asking if he's in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would dry, and yelled. He thinks she's being defensive because she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author was concerned about being late, which is understandable, especially for a wedding. He gave a clear deadline and tried to set expectations. The fianc\u00e9e didn't meet that deadline, so he left to avoid being late. On the other hand, leaving her alone might be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked with clothes not ready), and raising his voice was harsh. Also, he told her the clothes \"would be dry\" but that might not have been a promise, just an estimation.\n\nBut the key point is that he left her home. Was that his responsibility? If he's prioritizing punctuality over her well-being, maybe he's being too strict. However, weddings usually have strict schedules, and arriving late can be disruptive. But leaving her in that state could be problematic. Also, the fact that they have this recurring issue suggests communication problems, not just one wrong act.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. Taking her to the wedding is part of being considerate and ensuring she gets there safely. Leaving her might have been a harsh reaction. However, the fianc\u00e9e's consistent time management issues are part of the problem too. \n\nThe author raised his voice, which is not good, but the main question is about leaving. Leaving could be seen as abandoning her, especially in an embarrassing situation. So maybe he's in the wrong here. But some might argue that he was trying to be responsible by not being late. It's a tough call. I think the author might share some responsibility, but maybe not entirely. But the answer options are A or B. The user wants a yes or no if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for the balance of responsibility. The author did leave her in a bad situation, and while her time management is an issue, the author's response was extreme. So probably, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he left her in a vulnerable state despite knowing her past issues. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, the act of leaving could be seen as wrong.\n"
