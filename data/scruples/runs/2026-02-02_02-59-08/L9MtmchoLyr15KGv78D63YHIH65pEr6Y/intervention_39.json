Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, let's call him Will for simplicity, had a plan with his fianc\u00e9e Jill to leave by 3:45 PM to attend a wedding starting at 4:30 PM. He reminded her earlier to start getting ready because the laundry would take time. She assured him she'd be fine, but by 3:45 PM, she wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and Will got frustrated. He raised his voice, waited until 4:00 PM, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone. Now Jill is upset, saying he's impatient, lied about the laundry, and was mean by yelling. Will thinks she's deflecting because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and how they handled the situation.\n\nOn one hand, Will had a valid concern about being on time, which he considers important. He gave Jill a clear deadline and a heads-up. However, the laundry time was uncertain because he said \"probably\" they'd be dry, but Jill might not have trusted that. She might have planned differently, thinking maybe it wouldn't dry in time. Also, by 3:45, she's still not ready. Maybe she overestimated her ability to get ready quickly. But Will's response was to raise his voice and then leave her. Leaving her at home could be seen as abandoning her or being overly harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's pattern of poor time management is mentioned. They have this conversation often, implying she's aware of the problem but continues to not meet deadlines. Will's frustration is understandable. However, yelling and leaving might not be the best way to handle it. Arguably, Will should have tried to communicate more effectively, maybe set clearer expectations earlier, or helped her get ready instead of just giving up. Leaving her alone could be seen as not supporting her during a stressful situation, even if she's at fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that he left her \"naked\" might add to the emotional impact. It's a sensitive situation, and leaving someone in that state could be considered callous. While he wanted to be on time, his method of dealing with the problem might be seen as inconsiderate. Maybe he should have waited a bit longer, even if it meant arriving a few minutes late, rather than leaving her completely.\n\nBut then again, if he's consistently frustrated by her time management and this is a recurring issue, it's possible that his reaction is a culmination of past frustrations. However, that doesn't excuse yelling or abandoning her. The question is about whether his actions in this specific instance are wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. Jill is responsible for not being ready on time, but Will's response of yelling and leaving could be seen as a mistake. He might not be the sole person at fault, but perhaps he's in the wrong for not handling the situation better. However, some might argue that he's justified in wanting to be on time and that Jill should take more responsibility for her part.\n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is that Will is partially at fault but not entirely. However, the question is a binary choice between A (Yes, in the wrong) and B (No). The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to weigh the options.\n\nI think the key here is that while Jill is responsible for her time management, Will's actions\u2014raising his voice and leaving her\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly exacerbating the situation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
