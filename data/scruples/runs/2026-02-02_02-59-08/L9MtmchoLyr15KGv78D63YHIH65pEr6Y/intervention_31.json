Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that Jill is often late, and they have this issue frequently. He tried to plan ahead by telling her they need to leave at 3:45. She said she'd be okay, but ended up not being ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, made a promise about the laundry, and yelled.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author planned the timeline, gave her a clear deadline, but when she didn't meet it, he reacted poorly. Raising his voice adds emotional stress, which is a problem. However, Jill's repeated tardiness is a contributing factor. The author had a valid concern about being on time for the wedding, which is a common social expectation.\n\nBut, the author's solution was to leave her behind. That seems harsh. Even if Jill was at fault, leaving her in that state (naked, clothes not dry) might be seen as abandoning her, which isn't supportive. Also, the author made a promise about the laundry, which he didn't keep, adding to Jill's frustration. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe a better approach would be to talk calmly and help her get ready if possible.\n\nHowever, Jill's behavior is also problematic. She's aware of her time management issues but didn't take the deadline seriously. The author tried to set boundaries, which is reasonable. But his response escalated the situation. Yelling and leaving might be seen as overreacting, even if he had a valid reason.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method he used to handle it isn't. Leaving her might have been a way to avoid being late, but it's not helpful for their relationship. He could have chosen a different approach, like staying and helping her finish getting ready while addressing the lateness issue later.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author made a mistake in his reaction, even if Jill's behavior contributed to the problem. He should have handled the situation with more patience and understanding instead of escalating it. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
