Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at managing time, which leads to them being late often. The event was a wedding starting at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The author gave a heads-up about leaving on time, but Jill wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, the author tried to communicate the importance of punctuality. He mentioned the time they should leave and even reminded her to start early. That shows he's trying to be responsible. But Jill didn't take the advice and ended up not being ready. The author then left because he didn't want to be late to the wedding, which is understandable as being late to a wedding can be considered disrespectful.\n\nHowever, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling. Even if he was stressed, yelling isn't a good way to handle frustration, especially in a relationship. It could be seen as disrespectful to Jill, even if she's the one causing the delay. The fact that he left her at home might have been a harsh reaction. He could have given her a bit more time or tried to help her get ready instead of just departing.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might be at fault for not managing her time properly. She knew the deadline and the consequences of being late. But the author's reaction involved yelling and leaving her alone, which could hurt her feelings. The question is whether his actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, communication and patience are key. The author's frustration is valid, but his method of handling it might have been inappropriate. Leaving her alone could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry), which might not be supportive. Even if he had to attend the wedding on time, there might have been a better way to handle the situation, like calling someone else to pick her up or staying a bit longer to help her.\n\nSo, considering both sides: Jill's time management issues led to the problem, but the author's reaction (yelling and leaving) might be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for how he handled the situation despite the initial issue being Jill's responsibility.\n"
