Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because she wasn't ready on time. They had previously discussed the timing, and the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, agreed to have her clothes dry by 3:45. But she wasn't ready by then, so the author left her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned to leave at 3:45 and gave a heads-up to Jill. She said she was fine, but then at 3:45, her clothes were still damp, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, made a mistake about the laundry, and was mean. The author thinks Jill is being defensive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author wanted to be on time and set a clear expectation. Jill didn't meet that expectation, which led to the author leaving. However, the author raised their voice, which is a form of yelling. That's a point against them because yelling is unkind, even if frustrated. Also, leaving the fianc\u00e9e alone might have been a harsh reaction. On the other hand, the author tried to communicate the timing ahead of time and gave warnings. Jill had the opportunity to prepare but didn't. \n\nBut in a relationship, communication and empathy are important. Even if Jill is at fault for not getting ready on time, the author's reaction might be seen as harsh. Yelling and leaving in the middle of the event could hurt the fianc\u00e9e's feelings. Also, the author assumed the laundry would be dry, which might not have been communicated clearly. Maybe Jill had a reason why the laundry wouldn't dry in time, but the author didn't consider that. \n\nThere's a balance between accountability and compassion. The author might be in the right about wanting to be on time, but their approach could have been better. Instead of yelling and leaving, perhaps they could have offered to help or adjusted the plan if they were both running late. Leaving the fianc\u00e9e alone might also be unsafe or cause her to feel abandoned. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. The author's mistake was the yelling and leaving, but Jill's mistake was not taking the time management seriously. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. Since they raised their voice and left, those actions contribute to being in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving, despite Jill's own faults. But it's a shared responsibility to some extent. However, since the user is asking specifically about the author, the answer would focus on their actions.\n"
