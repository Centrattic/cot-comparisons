Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had previously discussed the need to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. The author warned her to start early, but she didn't. When the time came, she wasn't ready, clothes were damp, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nThe author argues that Jill is being defensive and in the wrong. But from the story, the key points are communication and actions. The author gave a clear deadline and reminder. Jill didn't start on time, leading to lateness. The author's frustration led to yelling and leaving. \n\nLeaving someone at home, especially a fianc\u00e9e, can be seen as abandoning them, even if the intention was to be punctual. Yelling adds emotional harm. However, the author did give multiple warnings. On the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time as agreed. \n\nBut the act of leaving someone alone, especially when they're not ready, might be seen as inconsiderate. The author's priority was on punctuality, but the method was harsh. The fianc\u00e9e's feelings are hurt, and the author's actions could be seen as dismissive of her situation. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for the way they handled it, even if the initial problem was Jill's time management. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's a mix. The author might not be entirely at fault because Jill didn't follow through, but the way he left and yelled could be seen as wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. Since he left her at home, even if justified, it could be seen as AITA. But maybe the main issue is Jill's time management. \n\nHmm. The answer might hinge on whether leaving a partner at home, even if they're at fault, is inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong because despite the deadline, he didn't help or wait, which could be seen as abandoning. Alternatively, if Jill was responsible and the author followed through with the plan, maybe not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but often in these scenarios, the person who leaves is seen as at fault if it's a partner, even if the partner is responsible. So maybe A (author is in the wrong) because of the way he left and yelled, despite the initial problem.\n"
