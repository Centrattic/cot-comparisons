Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they were going to a wedding that started at 4:30 PM. The author, let's call him Mike, told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be okay. But at 3:45, she was still not ready, clothes were slightly damp, and Mike got upset. He raised his voice and left at 4:00, meeting her there. Now, Jill is upset, feeling Mike was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled.\n\nSo, the key points here. Mike set a clear time to leave to be on time, and Jill assured him she could handle it. But she didn't. Mike waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the planned departure time. The wedding starts at 4:30, so maybe they could still make it if they left later. But Mike doesn't want to be late. However, he left Jill at home, which caused her to miss the event?\n\nWait, the wedding starts at 4:30, and they were 30 minutes away. If Mike left at 4:00, he'd arrive at 4:30. But if Jill wasn't ready until later, she would have left later, arriving maybe 30 minutes after the start. But Mike left her at home, meaning she didn't go to the wedding? Or did he meet her there? The user says he said he'd meet her there, so maybe he went to the wedding, and Jill had to get ready and go on her own. That's a problem because she was left behind.\n\nBut why did Mike leave? Because he couldn't wait any longer. Jill's behavior was a recurring issue, and he was frustrated. He raised his voice, which Jill found mean. So he yelled, then left her. She's upset because he's being impatient and defensive.\n\nIs Mike in the wrong? Well, he did set a time, but maybe he should have handled the situation differently. Leaving her at home might be seen as abandoning her, especially if she wasn't ready. Even if she was responsible for her own time management, Mike's decision to leave could have been hurtful. He might have considered taking her anyway, even if they were late, instead of leaving her. Also, the yelling adds to the conflict. So maybe he's at fault for both raising his voice and leaving her behind. On the other hand, Jill did know they needed to leave on time and failed to prepare. But the question is whether Mike was wrong. If he left her, causing her to miss the wedding, that's a big deal. So he might be in the wrong for not supporting her despite her oversight. Alternatively, if he left to be punctual and she was the one who didn't manage her time, maybe he's not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but in relationships, communication and support matter. Mike could have handled it better. So answer A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no)?\n"
