Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. The author mentions that they had a conversation earlier in the day about leaving by 3:45 to arrive on time for the 4:30 wedding. The author gave a heads-up, and Jill said she would be fine. But when the time came, she wasn't ready, her clothes were still damp from the laundry, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her at 4:00.\n\nNow, the author is being accused by Jill of being impatient, not telling her the clothes would be dry, and being mean by yelling. The author thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nLet me consider both sides. The author tried to communicate the timing in advance, which is reasonable. They gave her a clear deadline and a heads-up. However, when the time came, Jill wasn't ready, which led to frustration. The author's reaction included raising their voice, which could be seen as yelling, and then leaving her. \n\nLeaving someone at home when you're supposed to be going somewhere together could be problematic. Even if the other person is at fault for not being ready, the author's decision to leave without them might have caused emotional harm. They didn't wait for her to get dressed, even if she was running late. Also, the author might have taken responsibility by staying with her, helping her get ready, or at least ensuring she had transportation to the wedding. \n\nThe yelling adds to the issue because it's a form of raising their voice in frustration, which can escalate conflicts. While the author tried to set expectations, their response to the situation was impulsive. Maybe a better approach would have been to stay and help, even if they were upset, rather than leaving her alone in an undressed state.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill is responsible for her own time management and not heeding the warnings. But the author's actions in this moment might have crossed a line. Leaving someone without ensuring their safety or well-being, especially when they're in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready), could be seen as inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's impatience led to a decision that might have made Jill feel abandoned, even if she was at fault for not being ready.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, there's a shared element. Jill wasn't ready, but the author's reaction could have been more understanding or helpful. The key point is whether the author's actions were wrong in the context of their relationship. Even if Jill was in the wrong, the author's decision to leave might have been a harsh response that could damage their relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is partially at fault. They didn't handle the situation calmly and left their fianc\u00e9e in a potentially embarrassing or uncomfortable situation. While Jill's time management is an issue, the author's response wasn't the best. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
