Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they live 30 minutes away. The author mentioned they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. But Jill wasn't ready by then\u2014her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, saying they'd meet there.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author is frustrated because this is a recurring issue with Jill's time management. They've had this conversation before, and Jill assured them she'd be ready. The author tried to give a heads-up about the time, which seems reasonable. On the other hand, Jill might feel that the author didn't support her during a stressful time, especially since she was getting ready for a wedding, which can be a big deal. The author raised their voice, which is a problem, but then left, which might have been an overreaction.\n\nThe key points here are the recurring issue of time management and the immediate situation. The author's intention was to not be late, which is understandable. However, their reaction\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014might have been too harsh. Even though Jill was responsible for being ready, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe staying and helping, or at least being more patient. Leaving might have been hurtful, even if the intention was to be on time.\n\nBut then again, the author had already given multiple warnings. They told Jill to start the laundry early, set the departure time, and reminded her. Jill didn't take those seriously. So maybe the author felt they had no choice but to leave to maintain their punctuality. However, the method of leaving might have been the issue. Yelling and then leaving could be seen as abandoning Jill, which is unkind.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have expressed frustration without yelling and then decided to leave, but maybe staying for a few more minutes to help might have been better. Also, the author's own behavior of being impatient and yelling is problematic. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's response could have been more constructive.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be partly at fault for their reaction. Leaving Jill unprepared might not be their responsibility, but the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and leaving abruptly\u2014could have been more considerate. The fact that they had this conversation before might mean Jill is responsible for her time management, but the author's escalation (yelling and leaving) is on them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, at least partially. But maybe not entirely. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they tried to be responsible and left when they saw they'd be late. But the method of handling it was poor. The key is whether leaving was acceptable given the circumstances. If they left to be punctual, that's understandable, but the manner of leaving caused hurt. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of their reaction and the way they left, even if the underlying issue was Jill's time management. Relationships require support, and leaving in frustration without support might be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
