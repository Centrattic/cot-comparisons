Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The main issue is about time management and stress leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time, and they often end up being late or he gets stressed. He wanted to be punctual for the wedding, which is understandable. He told her to start her laundry early because they needed to leave by 3:45. She said she would be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her to go to the wedding alone, arriving late.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\n1. **Communication**: The author had warned Jill about the time they needed to leave and gave her a heads-up. She agreed she would be fine, but didn't manage her time properly. However, maybe the author could have set clearer expectations or checked in more frequently to see how she was progressing. But he did give her the heads-up, so maybe he's not entirely at fault here.\n\n2. **Reaction to the Situation**: When Jill wasn't ready by the agreed time, the author got upset and raised his voice. Yelling in frustration is a common issue in stress situations, but it's not a good approach. However, he was trying to manage their time and avoid being late. But yelling can be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the situation.\n\n3. **Leaving Her**: The author left Jill at home, choosing to go to the wedding alone. Was that the right decision? Well, he didn't want to be late, but leaving her behind when she wasn't ready could have caused her distress. Weddings are important events, and being late might be considered impolite, but so is leaving a partner behind in a stressful situation.\n\n4. **Responsibility Sharing**: The author might feel he's the patient one here, but maybe he should have helped Jill get ready instead of waiting and then leaving. Or perhaps he should have been more flexible with the timeline, understanding that sometimes things don't go as planned. Alternatively, maybe Jill should have managed her time better, but the author's response was to raise his voice and leave, which could be seen as harsh.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean. The author thinks she's being defensive. However, from an outside perspective, it's possible that the author's actions (yelling and leaving) caused emotional harm, which might be a bigger issue than being late to the wedding.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a two-way issue. Jill didn't manage her time well and left the author in a difficult spot. The author, however, responded in a way that could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. Yelling is never acceptable, and leaving a partner behind without support could be hurtful. While the author had a valid concern about punctuality, his method of handling the situation was problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be that the author is partially at fault for his reaction, even if Jill was also at fault for not managing her time. The act of raising his voice and leaving her could be seen as inconsiderate and harsh. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
