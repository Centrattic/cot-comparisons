Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author and Jill were going to a wedding 30 minutes away starting at 4:30. The author mentioned leaving at 3:45 latest. They had a conversation at 1:30 where the author warned Jill about the time. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left her at 4:00, choosing to go to the wedding without her.\n\nJill is upset because the author is \"impatient,\" told her clothes would be dry (but they were slightly damp), and was mean by yelling. The author thinks Jill is defensive and in the wrong.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate both sides. The main points are time management and communication. The author set a clear departure time to avoid being late, which is understandable since punctuality is important and they don't want to be late to a wedding. Jill, on the other hand, didn't manage her time well and didn't meet the agreed-upon deadline. However, the author raised their voice, which is a sign of losing patience. But did they have a valid reason? They had given a heads-up earlier, and Jill assured them she'd be ready. \n\nThe author left without Jill, which could be seen as abandoning her, but given the context of the wedding, maybe they felt it was better to be there on time. However, what's the consequence? Jill missed the wedding, or maybe they thought she'd meet them there later? The author might have known Jill would take longer and still be late if they waited, so leaving to be on time could be their attempt to honor the commitment to the wedding. \n\nBut in a relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9e, leaving someone behind because they're not ready might be considered inconsiderate. The author's frustration led to yelling, which is a problem. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready on time, the author's reaction might be part of the issue. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. \n\nThe AITA format usually asks if the person is the asshole. Jill is upset because she feels disrespected and the author didn't account for her needs. The author thinks Jill is in the wrong for not managing time. The key here is that the author did give a warning and set a time. Jill failed to meet that time, possibly due to underestimating how long she needed. The author left to prevent being late, but the yelling and leaving without a clear alternative plan might be the problem. \n\nIn some cases, the asshole is the one who doesn't take responsibility. The author left, but maybe should have waited a bit more or found a way to get Jill ready without yelling. However, since they had discussed this before, maybe the author had a right to expect compliance. The act of leaving could be seen as holding Jill accountable for her chronic lateness, but the method (yelling and abandoning) could be the issue. \n\nSo, the author might have a valid reason for wanting to be on time, but the approach taken could be considered harsh. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they raised their voice and left without ensuring Jill could still make it, even if she was responsible for the delay. The yelling is a clear wrongdoing, and leaving her behind might not be the best solution. Alternatively, if the author was trying to enforce their own values of punctuality, but the means were mean, then maybe A. But if Jill is responsible for the lateness, then B (not in the wrong) could be the case. \n\nI think in AITA scenarios, the person's actions that cause harm to others, even if the other person is also at fault, can make them the asshole. The author left their fianc\u00e9e, which is a significant action. However, they had given a heads-up. The yelling is definitely a problem. So the answer might be A because of the yelling and leaving her behind, even if the situation was frustrating. But some might argue that the author had a right to be strict about the time. \n\nHmm. The community's take often depends on the expectations and how they were communicated. The author set a clear time, Jill didn't meet it. But leaving her without a ride could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author did mention they'd meet there later. Maybe the problem is the yelling, not the leaving. So the author is in the wrong for yelling, but not for leaving? The question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving. The answer should consider both the yelling and the decision to leave. If the author's actions in both aspects are considered, then maybe A. But if the main issue is Jill's time management, then B. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author should have handled the situation without yelling and perhaps found another solution to ensure Jill could still get to the wedding. Leaving her behind because she's late is harsh, even if she was the one who caused the delay. There might be a better way to communicate frustration without abandoning a partner. So, the author's actions were wrong.\n"
