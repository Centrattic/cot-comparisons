Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding started at 4:30 and the author wanted to leave by 3:45. They warned Jill earlier, but she didn't manage her time well, and when it came time to leave, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they did warn Jill multiple times about leaving on time. They even gave her a heads up at 1:30 that they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill, on the other hand, said she'd be fine but didn't manage her time properly. The author tried waiting until 4:00 but left when she wasn't ready. \n\nNow, the key points. The author was trying to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests, which is a valid concern. However, raising their voice shows frustration, which could be seen as yelling or being impatient. Leaving Jill behind might have been a decision made out of frustration and to avoid being late, but it's also important to consider Jill's feelings and the fact that they are engaged. \n\nJill's perspective: She might feel that the author didn't support her and instead of helping her get ready, he reacted with anger. She could feel abandoned, especially if she was still in the process of getting ready. The author mentioned that Jill's clothes were slightly damp, which might mean they didn't dry as expected, but the author had said the clothes would be dry. If the author assured her the clothes would be dry and then it didn't happen, that's a problem. But maybe the author didn't control the dryer's time.\n\nThe author's defense is that Jill was in the wrong for not managing her time. However, even if Jill is at fault, the author's response of yelling and leaving might not be appropriate. Communication is key in relationships, and reacting with anger can escalate the situation. The author could have handled the stress better, maybe by staying and helping her get ready instead of leaving, even if they were worried about being late. \n\nAlso, the fact that they are engaged means that their actions affect each other. Leaving someone behind in a stressful situation can cause emotional harm. While being on time is important, so is supporting one's partner. The author's actions might be seen as impatience and lack of empathy in the moment. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for raising their voice and leaving, especially considering the relationship context. Even if Jill was at fault for the time management, the response could have been more understanding and supportive. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
