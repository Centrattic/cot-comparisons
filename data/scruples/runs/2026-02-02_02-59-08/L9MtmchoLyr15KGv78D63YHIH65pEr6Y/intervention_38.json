Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had a prior conversation about leaving by 3:45. The author told Jill to start her laundry early because they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but when the time came, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, making Jill go to the wedding alone.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to be on time and avoid being late, which they find disrespectful. They tried to communicate the timeline in advance. However, they did raise their voice, which is a valid point of conflict. Leaving a partner alone, especially in a relationship, might cause hurt feelings even if the intention was to be punctual.\n\nOn Jill's side, she might not have managed her time properly despite being given a clear deadline. However, the author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of leaving abruptly, maybe they could have tried to help her get ready or at least communicated more calmly. Also, the author said the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp, which Jill might have felt was a broken promise, adding to her frustration.\n\nThe key points here are communication and handling frustration. The author's frustration led to yelling and leaving, which could be seen as harsh. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's reaction might have been excessive. In a relationship, it's important to support each other, even in stressful situations. Leaving the fianc\u00e9e alone might have been a mistake, regardless of the reason, because it can cause emotional harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction and the decision to leave. They could have found a better solution instead of escalating the situation. The answer would likely be A.\n"
