Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author, let's call him Will, left his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They had a time to leave set for 3:45 PM, but at that time, Jill wasn't ready. Will was upset and raised his voice, then left her at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is mad, saying he was impatient, didn't tell her the clothes would be dry (even though he said they \"probably\" would be), and was mean by yelling.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. Will gave a heads-up that they needed to leave by 3:45, and Jill said she'd be fine. Then, when the time came, she wasn't ready, and he left. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to be punctual and respectful of others' time, which he values. He set a clear deadline, and when Jill didn't meet it, he chose to leave rather than be late. He might feel that he's right because he followed through on the plan they discussed, even if it meant leaving her behind.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel that Will didn't support her enough. He told her to start her laundry early but then left her when she wasn't ready. She might also be upset about the raised voice, which is definitely a negative action. Even if he was frustrated, yelling is not okay. Also, the fact that the clothes were only slightly damp\u2014maybe he implied they'd be dry, leading to her miscalculating the time? If that's the case, he could be at fault for not being clear about the laundry situation. But in the conversation, Will said \"probably but up to you,\" so maybe he didn't guarantee they'd be dry. Jill might be holding that against him if the delay was because the clothes weren't dry, but if Will's wording was a bit ambiguous, that could be a point of contention.\n\nThe bigger issue is Will leaving her. Was that a reasonable response? If they had a plan and she didn't follow through, maybe he was right to go, but leaving her alone when she's not ready might not be the best choice. Also, the fact that she was \"naked\" at 3:45 might imply that there was a miscommunication about how long things would take. Maybe Will expected her to be ready by 3:45, but she needed more time. However, she agreed to the 3:45 deadline, so he might think she's responsible for that.\n\nBut then, the argument is that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time. If this is a recurring issue, Will might be frustrated, but leaving her in a bind isn't helpful. Also, the yelling is a red flag. Even if he's stressed, raising his voice is not acceptable. So, while the core issue is about time management and punctuality, the yelling and leaving her behind are actions that could be seen as inconsiderate or even cruel.\n\nAnother angle: when you're in a relationship, especially engaged, supporting each other is important. If Jill is trying her best and Will is being impatient, maybe there's a cultural or personal value here. Some people might value punctuality a lot, others might see being there as a priority even if slightly late. The event is a wedding, so arriving on time is traditional, but missing part of it because of a car ride isn't unheard of. \n\nIn terms of the laundry, if Will said the clothes might be dry but didn't guarantee, and Jill took that at face value, maybe that's part of the problem. But he did tell her to start early. So perhaps he's not entirely at fault for the laundry part. The main issue is his reaction\u2014yelling and leaving.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Will is in the wrong for yelling and for leaving Jill behind. Even if he's frustrated, those actions are negative. The fact that this is a recurring issue doesn't justify his behavior. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
