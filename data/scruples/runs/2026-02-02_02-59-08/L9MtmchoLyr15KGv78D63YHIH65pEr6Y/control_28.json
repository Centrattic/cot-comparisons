Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The event was a wedding 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The fianc\u00e9 told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to arrive on time. They had this kind of time management issue before, which suggests it's a recurring problem. At 1:30 PM, he mentioned the laundry and set a time to leave. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45 PM, she was still not ready. The fianc\u00e9 got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00 PM, then left without her. \n\nJill is upset because he yelled, said the clothes would be dry (maybe implying he assured her they'd be dry, but they were slightly damp), and called him impatient. He thinks she's being defensive. \n\nSo, the main points are: recurring time management issues, the fianc\u00e9's frustration leading to raising his voice, leaving her behind. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Did he have a right to leave? Well, he wanted to be on time, which is reasonable. However, the way he handled it might be problematic. Raising his voice is a form of yelling, which can be hurtful. Also, leaving without her might have been impulsive. But he was trying to avoid being late, which he considers disrespectful. \n\nJill's side is that she wasn't ready, maybe because the clothes weren't dry. The fianc\u00e9 might have underestimated the time needed for her to get ready. They might have communication issues. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe both have some responsibility. The author did raise his voice, which is a negative action. However, the recurring problem with time management is on Jill, perhaps. The fianc\u00e9's action of leaving might have been a result of frustration from repeated issues. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Leaving someone at home before a social event could be seen as abandonment, even if it's their own home. Also, yelling is a form of emotional harm. Even if the situation is frustrating, raising his voice is not acceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, he was trying to be punctual, which is a valid concern. Maybe he should have handled it differently, like setting earlier deadlines or having a backup plan. But leaving her alone at home after a fight might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might share some responsibility. He could have communicated better, maybe offered help, or found another solution instead of leaving. Yelling is definitely a problem. However, the root issue is Jill's time management. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since he left her, yelled, and maybe didn't fully consider her situation, the answer might lean towards AITA. However, in some perspectives, the fianc\u00e9 isn't entirely wrong because he was trying to be punctual. \n\nHmm. In AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. But in this case, the key points are the raised voice and leaving her. Since he did those things, he's probably seen as being in the wrong, at least partially. However, if the community sees that Jill's recurring issues caused the problem, maybe the answer is B. \n\nBut I think the act of leaving her, especially after yelling, is a big thing. The answer might be A. Wait, but the user says to answer A for yes (in the wrong) and B for no. So if the author is in the wrong, answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he was trying to avoid being late. But the yelling and leaving are issues. \n\nI think in this case, the author made a poor choice by yelling and leaving, so he's partially at fault. But the user's question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he did raise his voice and left her, which caused hurt, the answer might be A. However, if the main issue is Jill's time management, maybe the answer is B. \n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up, but in AITA situations, the person who makes a hurtful decision (like yelling and leaving) is often seen as in the wrong, even if the other person contributed. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
