Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. So, first, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe key points are: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM. The author gave her a heads up at 1:30 that they needed to leave by 3:45, and she said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp. The author gets upset, raises his voice, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her. Now, she's upset, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, first, the author's actions. He gave a clear deadline and she didn't meet it. He was stressed about being late. He did raise his voice, which is a problem. He left her at home. Is that justifiable? Well, maybe not. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, leaving her behind might be considered harsh. Also, he told her the clothes would be dry, but maybe that's part of the issue. He might have been dismissive of her needing more time. The fact that he left her at home, even if she was late, could be seen as abandoning her, especially since they were going to a wedding together. Also, yelling is a red flag. So maybe he's in the wrong for the way he handled it, even if her time management was an issue. The question is whether leaving her behind was the right decision. People might argue that he should have communicated better, given her more time, or found another solution instead of just leaving. On the other hand, showing up late to an event is also a social faux pas. But the act of leaving her at home could be seen as more hurtful. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong, because he reacted in a way that was unkind and left her in an awkward situation. But maybe some would say he had a reason. However, given the details, the author's actions (yelling, leaving her behind) seem to cross into being inconsiderate, even if the fianc\u00e9e made mistakes. So probably A.\n"
