Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves some time management issues and communication problems between the couple.\n\nFirst, the author (let's call him Will) mentions that Jill isn't good with time management. They had agreed on a departure time of 3:45 to make it to the wedding by 4:30. Jill said she'd be ready, but when 3:45 came, she wasn't. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFrom the description, Will's frustration is understandable. Being on time is important, and repeated instances of Jill being late have likely built up his stress. However, the key points here are his reaction and the decision to leave. Raising his voice is a form of yelling, which can be seen as disrespectful, even if he's frustrated. Then, leaving her at home without ensuring she got there another way might be seen as abandoning her, especially since they were going to a wedding together. \n\nJill's perspective is that he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry being damp (even though he said \"probably dry\"), and was mean by yelling. She might feel that his impatience led to a harsh response. On the other hand, Will might argue that Jill knew the time and failed to meet it, so he was justified in leaving to avoid being late.\n\nThe question is whether Will is in the wrong. While Jill's time management is an issue, Will's response involved yelling and leaving her, which could be seen as inconsiderate. He didn't offer alternatives, like waiting a bit more or helping her get ready. Leaving her alone might have caused her to miss the event entirely, which could be hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of reacting with frustration, a better approach might have been to calmly discuss the situation and find a solution together. By leaving abruptly, Will might have made the situation worse, even if Jill was at fault for being unprepared. \n\nSo, considering both sides, while Jill's time management is a problem, Will's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and harsh. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong (A), but there's nuance here. However, based on the typical AITA dynamics, the focus is on the immediate action. Since he left her and yelled, that's often seen as the wrong move, making him AITA.\n"
