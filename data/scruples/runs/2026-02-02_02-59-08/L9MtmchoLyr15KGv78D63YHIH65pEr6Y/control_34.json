Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, leading to frequent lateness. The author is concerned about being on time. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. They agreed that leaving by 3:45 was necessary. The author mentioned the laundry and gave a heads-up about the time. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready, clothes were damp, and the author left, getting frustrated.\n\nKey points: The author raised their voice, which Jill takes as being mean. The author left her to go to the wedding alone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a perspective of responsibility, the author tried to set a clear timeline and gave a heads-up. However, raising their voice in frustration could be seen as harsh. But the main action was leaving. Is it acceptable to leave someone to avoid being late to a commitment? \n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be respectful to the event's timing. On the other hand, abandoning a partner, even if frustrated, might be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that they had similar situations before might affect the judgment. If the author had a valid reason (not wanting to be late) and communicated the timeline clearly, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill's safety might tip the balance. But since the event is important and they had prior warnings, perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nAlso, Jill's reaction is based on the yelling and not the leaving? Or maybe she's upset about being left alone. The author thought Jill knew she was in the wrong, but maybe both share some responsibility. The author's action was a reaction to repeated behavior. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being on time is important, but so is supporting your partner. However, the author's decision to leave might be seen as prioritizing the event over their partner's readiness. But given the prior communication and the time constraints, maybe the author isn't at fault. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they tried to communicate, set expectations, and the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet them. However, the yelling is a point against them. But the main question is about leaving her. Maybe it's a gray area. \n\nAlternatively, consider if the author should have waited longer or found another solution. But the author couldn't wait until 4:00 and left. Maybe that's a reasonable decision given the prior issues. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B, but with the note that both parties have some responsibilities. But according to the options, it's A or B. The user wants a binary choice. Given that the author made an effort to communicate, set a time, and left when the other didn't meet it, the answer is B. However, the yelling is a factor. But the main issue is leaving. So B (not in the wrong).\n"
