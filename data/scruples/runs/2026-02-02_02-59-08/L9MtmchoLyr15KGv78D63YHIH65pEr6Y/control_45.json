Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9, let's call him Will, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill have a recurring issue where she's not good at time management. They were going to a wedding 30 minutes away starting at 4:30 PM. Will told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 latest to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she's not ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and he gets upset. He raises his voice, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her, saying he'll meet her there. Jill is upset, feeling he's impatient, made her clothes dry time, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe user is asking if Will is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, Will warned Jill about the time. He gave her a heads up, and she said she'd be fine. She didn't take his warning seriously, leading to the situation. He was trying to be punctual, which is respectful to others. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the intended departure time. Maybe he felt he had no choice to avoid being late for the wedding. But raising his voice is a problem. Also, leaving her at home might have caused her distress, making her feel abandoned or unappreciated. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time well, leading to the problem. She might not have realized the laundry wouldn't dry in time. But Will could have handled it better. Yelling isn't helpful. Maybe he should have waited longer or communicated differently, but since they were going to be late regardless, leaving to be on time could be seen as reasonable. However, leaving her behind might have been harsh. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are: he gave a clear time, she didn't take it seriously, he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. Leaving her might have been necessary to avoid being late, but the yelling and abrupt departure are issues. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if Jill was at fault for time management, Will's reaction could be seen as harsh. However, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. If the wedding was important, being on time is expected. But abandoning her because she's not ready might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think there's a balance here. He's trying to do the right thing by being on time, but his method was poor. However, leaving her might not be entirely his fault if she's responsible for her own readiness. But the yelling is definitely on him. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Possibly a bit, but maybe not entirely. The answer might depend on cultural norms around punctuality and relationship dynamics. In some views, leaving is understandable. In others, the way he handled it is the problem. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the main action is leaving her, but the method (yelling) is his fault. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), but not entirely. Wait, the options are A for Yes (he's wrong) and B for No. Considering that he left her to keep their commitment, but the yelling and stress might make him at least partially wrong. However, in the scenario, he was trying to be punctual, which is a valid reason. The main issue is the yelling and the way he left. So maybe the answer is A because he handled it poorly, even if the intention was to be on time. Alternatively, maybe B because the core issue was Jill's time management. \n\nHmm. In some perspectives, he's not entirely wrong because he followed the plan he set. But in relationship terms, causing her emotional distress by yelling and leaving is problematic. So the answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted. The key is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. Since he left her to avoid being late, which is his responsibility, but she's responsible for her own readiness. So maybe he's not wrong for leaving, but wrong for yelling. The question is about leaving her. \n\nThe original question is about whether he's in the wrong for leaving. If the act of leaving itself is the issue, then maybe not. But if the way he did it (yelling, not being supportive) is the issue, then A. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong for leaving, and the answer hinges on his method. The answer is A because the way he left was inappropriate, even if the reason (being on time) is valid. So, A.\n"
