Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before they had to leave for a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they live 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be ready but wasn't, and when the author got frustrated and left at 4:00, she was still not ready. The author raised their voice, which Jill is now calling mean. The author is defensive, thinking Jill is being defensive.\n\nSo, the key points here: communication style, time management, and how the situation was handled. The author emphasized punctuality, which is a valid concern. They did give a clear deadline multiple times. However, when things went wrong, the author responded with yelling, which escalated the situation. Even if Jill was late, the author could have handled it differently\u2014maybe by trying to help her get ready instead of leaving. Also, the author promised the clothes would be dry but they were only slightly damp, which might have been a factor in Jill's preparation time.\n\nLeaving Jill naked and alone, even if to make the event on time, could be seen as abandoning her, which is not supportive. The author's frustration is understandable, but their actions (yelling and leaving) are what's in question. In relationships, how you handle stress and conflicts matters a lot. The author's approach might have been too harsh, even if Jill was at fault for being unprepared. So, while Jill's chronic lateness is an issue, the author's response might be more in the wrong here. The author needs to consider both their impatience and the way they handled the situation. So, the answer would likely be Yes (A), the author is in the wrong.\n"
