Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, let's call him Will, left his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill wasn't ready by 3:45, and Will left her, not wanting to walk in as the wedding was starting.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if Will is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. Will mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time and they often get into these situations. He tried to set a deadline, told her to start her laundry in time, and she said she'd be fine. But she wasn't ready, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. He argues she's being defensive.\n\nJill's perspective is that he left her, was impatient, and yelled. She might feel abandoned, especially at a wedding, which is a significant event. Leaving her home alone when she's still in the process of getting ready could be seen as hurtful. Even if she was late, the act of leaving without her might be more about his frustration than her actual readiness. Also, he mentioned the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp, so maybe he made an assumption that didn't hold up.\n\nNow, considering communication. Will did set a time and warned her, but maybe he should have had a different approach. Yelling might be a red flag in a relationship, especially if it's a recurring issue. Leaving her might prevent them from getting to the wedding on time, but he might have felt it was the only option. However, leaving the wedding alone might not be ideal either. \n\nThe key points here are: Will left Jill to go to the wedding alone, he raised his voice, and Jill is upset about being left and the yelling. The question is whether Will's actions were wrong. The answer depends on whether the frustration and impatience justified the actions. Leaving her might be seen as abandoning her, especially if she wasn't ready, and yelling is a problem. So, even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, Will's response\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate and harsh. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation calmly and left her stranded. So, the answer would be A.\n"
