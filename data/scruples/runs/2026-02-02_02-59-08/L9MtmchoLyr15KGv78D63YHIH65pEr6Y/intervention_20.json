Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. They wanted to arrive on time and didn't want to be disrespectful. The wedding started at 4:30, and they had to leave by 3:45. The author had warned Jill earlier to start getting ready in time. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were still damp, and the author got frustrated, yelled, and left at 4:00 to arrive on time.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author was trying to be punctual, which is a valid concern. They had given a heads-up about the time, so they might have felt they did their part. However, yelling and leaving without Jill, especially when she was still getting ready, might be seen as impulsive and not considering her feelings. The author's frustration led to an action that left Jill alone, which could be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's history of poor time management and not preparing as instructed could mean she was aware of the issue. But the author's solution was to abandon her, which might not be the best approach. There might be better ways to handle the situation, like staying and helping her get ready on time or communicating more effectively instead of leaving in frustration.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author's decision to leave might have been driven by a desire to be respectful to others, but it's important to also respect a partner's feelings. Yelling and leaving abruptly could be seen as dismissive of Jill's efforts and her current state. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by arriving on time, but the method\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be where they went wrong. So, even though Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's actions contributed to the conflict by not handling the situation with more patience and support. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility here.\n"
