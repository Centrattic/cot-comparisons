Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management, and they often end up late. They were attending a wedding 30 minutes away that started at 4:30. The author told Jill they had to leave by 3:45 at the latest. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, her clothes were still slightly damp, and she wasn't ready. The author got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, made a comment about the clothes being dry, and yelled at her. The author believes Jill is being defensive and in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. Communication: The author had previously warned Jill about the time, and she assured him she'd be ready. He might be right to hold her to that, but maybe he should have checked in periodically instead of waiting until the last minute.\n\n2. Raising his voice: He admitted to raising his voice in frustration. That's a clear mistake. Even if he was stressed, yelling is not acceptable and could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a committed relationship.\n\n3. Leaving without her: The author left her at home. While he wanted to be punctual, leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her, which might be inconsiderate. However, the wedding was starting, and he didn't want to be late. But maybe he should have waited until she was ready or offered help instead of leaving.\n\n4. The clothes being dry: He told her the clothes would be dry if she started in time. If she started in time and they were only slightly damp, maybe he's responsible for not estimating the drying time correctly. That could be a point where he was wrong.\n\n5. Context: The author mentions they have this conversation often, indicating a recurring issue. Maybe there's a pattern here where Jill's time management and the author's impatience are both contributing factors.\n\nPutting this together, the author made a mistake by yelling and left in a way that might have been hurtful. However, Jill is responsible for not being ready on time. The author's actions were reactive, but he could have handled it better. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Yelling is a clear fault, but the decision to leave is more nuanced. Since he left her behind and was rude, it's likely he's at least partially in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes), but I need to check the reasoning again. Alternatively, if the situation is a mutual problem, maybe not. But since he took an action (leaving) that caused her to be upset, and he used yelling, he's probably in the wrong. So the answer is A."
