Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The scenario involves time management issues, communication problems, and a conflict resolution approach.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time. They often end up late, which frustrates the author. The wedding was at 4:30, 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, telling Jill they'd meet there.\n\nNow, the author is being criticized for being impatient, not ensuring the laundry would be dry, and yelling. The author believes Jill is defensive and in the wrong.\n\nTo assess if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The author's frustration is understandable given past issues with lateness. They communicated the deadline and gave a heads-up. However, leaving Jill unannounced and at 4:00, when the event started at 4:30, might have been harsh. The timing is tight, but leaving at 4:00 could have been avoidable with more patience or a different approach.\n\nThe author raised their voice, which is a valid criticism. Yelling is never good in such situations. However, the core issue is Jill not meeting the agreed-upon time. The author tried to be proactive to avoid being late but overreacted by leaving. A more constructive approach might have been to wait a bit longer, offer help, or find a compromise instead of abandoning Jill.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's responsibility is to be ready on time. She might have underestimated the time needed. The author's prior warnings were clear. But the author's actions could cause emotional distress. While the author has a point about punctuality, the method of handling the situation could be better.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did raise their voice, which is a mistake. Leaving without a better plan might be seen as abandonment. However, the root issue is Jill's time management. The author's actions, while understandable, might not be justified. The balance here is tricky. The answer might lean towards A (author in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill's well-being, but some might argue it's B (not in the wrong) due to the valid concern about punctuality. However, given the emotional impact and the alternative solutions, the author's approach was flawed, so A is more likely correct.\n"
