Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. They needed to leave by 3:45. The fianc\u00e9 told Jill they had to leave by 3:45, and she said she'd be fine. But then at 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her.\n\nSo, the main points here are time management, communication, and conflict. The author is frustrated because Jill isn't good with time, leading to lateness, which he finds disrespectful. He tried to set a clear deadline, but she didn't meet it. He left, and now she's upset, saying he was impatient and mean.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one side, the fianc\u00e9 had a clear expectation (leave at 3:45) and communicated that to her. Jill agreed but didn't follow through. He waited past the deadline, but maybe not long enough. He raised his voice, which is a mistake. However, he was trying to avoid being late to an event, which he considers important.\n\nOn the other side, maybe the fianc\u00e9 should have handled the situation differently. Yelling is never good. Leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was being unprepared. Also, maybe he should have given her more time but still left without her, leading to her missing the wedding. But wait, he did leave her time\u20143:45 to 4:00 is 15 minutes. However, the wedding started at 4:30, so 15 minutes might not be enough to get there on time, especially if traffic is a factor. Maybe he left earlier, but Jill wasn't ready. \n\nAnother angle: relationships require compromise. If Jill isn't good with time management, maybe the fianc\u00e9 could have helped her prepare earlier. But he did set a deadline, and she didn't meet it. However, raising his voice and leaving without her might have been a harsh reaction. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 says he waited until 4:00. So that's 15 minutes past the 3:45 deadline. That's not a lot of time, but maybe for getting dressed and getting ready, 15 minutes isn't enough. If the clothes were slightly damp, maybe the dryer wasn't done, so she had to wait. But she had time to start the laundry earlier. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author did raise his voice, which is a mistake. However, the situation of leaving might be a judgment call. If he left to avoid being late, which he values, but Jill was unprepared, maybe both are at fault. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 might not be entirely in the wrong for trying to uphold the agreed time, but his method (yelling and leaving) is problematic. However, the community's opinion on AITA often considers intent and actions. The fianc\u00e9's action of leaving might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if Jill would have to go alone without him. But he thought she was in the wrong for not being ready. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he raised his voice and left her, which could be seen as abandonment. Alternatively, B (No) if he's justified in upholding the time. But given that he left her behind and yelled, the community might side more with A. But I need to be careful. Maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more accommodating, even if Jill was late. Or maybe both are at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that he left her, which caused her to miss the event, and he raised his voice, he's partly at fault. But the problem started with Jill's time management. But the AITA often looks at the final action. So, maybe A is the answer.\n"
