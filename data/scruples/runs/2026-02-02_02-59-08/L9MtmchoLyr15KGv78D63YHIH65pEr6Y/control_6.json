Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) was in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple had a recurring issue with time management. The fianc\u00e9 (let's call him John) mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, leading to them being late often. He values punctuality and considers lateness as rude. They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes from their house. John told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. She said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still getting ready. John got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left alone.\n\nNow, the key points: Did John do the right thing? Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, John had given a clear timeline. He reminded her to start early because he wanted to avoid being late. He waited past the deadline (until 4:00) and tried to stay calm, but eventually left to not miss the ceremony. He might feel that he was trying to respect the event's schedule and not be rude to the hosts or guests. However, he did raise his voice, which could be seen as being mean or impatient, as Jill points out.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel that John didn't support her and was being overbearing. Even if she's at fault for not managing her time, leaving her alone in a stressful situation might not be the best approach. The fact that their clothes weren't dry could be an unexpected issue, and maybe John could have been more understanding or helped her instead of leaving. Also, their communication history shows recurring issues, which might mean that John should have addressed the time management problem in a more constructive way rather than reacting with frustration.\n\nThe question is whether John was in the wrong. He did give a clear deadline, waited past it, and tried to leave to meet the time. But his reaction (raising his voice) and leaving her alone could be seen as harsh. However, the situation calls for a balance between being considerate to others (the wedding) and supporting his partner. \n\nAnother angle: Leaving someone alone in a stressful situation can be hurtful. Maybe a better approach would have been to stay and help or communicate more effectively. But considering the event's importance and their history, John might have felt it was necessary to attend the wedding on time. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, Jill did not follow the agreed timeline. However, John's reaction could be seen as impatience. The fact that he left her alone might be where he's in the wrong. While he might not be at fault for the time management issue, his decision to leave could be seen as abandoning her in a difficult moment. \n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No), the majority of people might lean towards A because he raised his voice and left her, which could be seen as harsh, even if she was at fault for the time management.\n"
