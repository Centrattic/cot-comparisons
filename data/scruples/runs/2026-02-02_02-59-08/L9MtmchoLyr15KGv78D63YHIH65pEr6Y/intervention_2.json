Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 leaving their partner at home because they're late for a wedding.\n\nFirst, the author explains that Jill isn't good with time management. He set a clear deadline of leaving by 3:45, but she wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient and mean. The author thinks she's being defensive.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, expectations, and handling stress. The author set a time, but maybe didn't check in enough to see if she could meet it. He assumed the laundry would dry in time, but she ended up with damp clothes. Raising his voice was a problem, as it's a form of yelling, which can be hurtful even if he was stressed.\n\nLeaving her alone might have been an overreaction. Instead of leaving, maybe he could have stayed and helped her get ready, or communicated better. The fact that they were going to a wedding, a formal event, adds pressure. But being late isn't the end of the world. However, his response of leaving might have been harsh. He also took away her choice to come later, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nJill's tardiness is a recurring issue, but the author's reaction might not be the healthiest solution. They need to address the time management problem without using frustration as a motivator. So, while Jill is late, the author's actions contributed to the conflict. He should have handled it more calmly and constructively. Therefore, he shares some responsibility.\n"
