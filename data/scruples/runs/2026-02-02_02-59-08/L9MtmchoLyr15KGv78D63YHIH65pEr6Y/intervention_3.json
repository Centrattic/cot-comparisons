Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the story. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. The author mentions this is a recurring issue. They had a conversation at 1:30 PM about leaving by 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. The author warned Jill to start early. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM, saying they'd meet there. Now Jill is upset because he was impatient, made a mistake about the laundry, and yelled.\n\nThe author thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. The user, however, thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. So, the main issues here are time management, communication, and conflict during stress. Let's consider both sides. The author tried to plan ahead, gave a heads-up about the time, and was trying to avoid being late. But they reacted by yelling and leaving, which could be seen as harsh. On Jill's side, she's supposed to be getting ready for a wedding, which is a big event, and she didn't manage her time, leading to the problem. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author left their fianc\u00e9e behind. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the act of leaving someone alone in a stressful situation might be problematic. The author could have handled it differently, like staying to help, trying to speed things up, or explaining the consequences of being late. Yelling and leaving might be seen as abandonment or not supporting the partner in a difficult moment. \n\nAlso, the author made a mistake about the laundry\u2014said \"probably dry\" but it was only slightly damp. That could contribute to the frustration. However, the main action is leaving Jill. Is that inconsiderate? Maybe. Even if the author is upset, taking off without ensuring Jill is okay could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be on time, which they consider respectful. They tried to communicate the time constraint. But the method of dealing with the situation\u2014leaving\u2014might be seen as a poor choice. The author could have faced the consequence of being late rather than leaving Jill behind. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for leaving, even if Jill's time management is an issue. The author's action of leaving could be seen as not supporting their partner when she was struggling, even if they were frustrated. Alternatively, some might argue that the author had a point about being late and had to make a decision. \n\nBut in terms of AITA standards, actions that cause emotional harm even if justified by the other person's behavior can lead to being in the wrong. The author's actions might be seen as not considering Jill's feelings and situation, even if Jill was at fault. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
