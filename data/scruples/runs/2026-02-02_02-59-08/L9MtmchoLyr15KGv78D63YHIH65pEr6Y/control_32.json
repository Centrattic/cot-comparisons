Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready on time for a wedding, and the author left her at home because they were going to be late. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45, but she wasn't ready until maybe 4:00, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about being on time, which they see as respectful. They gave a heads-up about the time and told Jill to start early if she needed two hours. Jill, on the other hand, might not be good with time management, which caused the problem. \n\nBut why did the author leave her? The argument is that they didn't want to arrive late, especially during the ceremony. However, leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready could be seen as abandoning her. Also, the author raised their voice, which adds to the conflict. \n\nIs the author responsible for Jill's time management issues? They might have given a warning, but perhaps they could have handled the situation differently. For example, maybe they could have waited a bit longer, or communicated better instead of yelling and leaving. \n\nBut if they left because arriving late was important, maybe that's understandable. However, the fact that they left her alone might be the problem here. Leaving someone at home when they're still getting ready could be seen as inconsiderate or not supportive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that Jill is defensive because she knows she's in the wrong. But the author admits to yelling, which is a valid point against them. So there are two issues here: yelling and leaving her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author should have handled the frustration without yelling and found a different solution. But was leaving the wrong thing to do? If they had to get to the wedding on time and couldn't wait anymore, perhaps they thought leaving was the only option. However, abandoning their fianc\u00e9e in that situation might be inconsiderate. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for yelling and leaving, but maybe Jill is also at fault for not being ready on time. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they left Jill alone, which could be seen as not supportive, and raised their voice, they might be at fault. But some might argue that the author was trying to be punctual and had legitimate reasons. \n\nHmm. It's a tricky situation. Maybe the right approach is to find a middle ground, like leaving a message or trying to contact her later, but the action of leaving her there without any support could be seen as wrong. So I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because leaving a fianc\u00e9e alone in that situation, especially after raising their voice, is inconsiderate and could have been handled better.\n"
