Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready by the time they needed to leave. The author waited until 4:00 when the wedding started at 4:30, but Jill was still not ready, so they left her and went to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill is usually kind but has issues with time management. The author set a deadline (3:45) for them to leave. Jill said she'd be fine, but she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset, thinking the author was impatient, didn't account for the clothes being damp, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author gave a clear deadline, but maybe Jill didn't plan her time correctly. However, the author also raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's reaction might be part of the problem. Leaving the fianc\u00e9e alone might be a harsh action. Weddings are important events, and showing up late or not attending could be hurtful. Also, the author assumed the clothes would dry, but maybe that wasn't a given. Jill might have relied on that and had a contingency plan, or maybe not. \n\nThe author's intention was to be on time and respectful to others, which is reasonable. But the way they handled the situation\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as impulsive and not considering Jill's feelings. Maybe the author should have tried to find another solution, like calling the wedding hosts to let them know they'd be late, or giving Jill a bit more time while being understanding. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill is responsible for her time management. If she's known for this issue, maybe the author should have planned extra time from the start. But the author did set a deadline. However, when things didn't go as planned, the author's response was leaving, which might have been too extreme. The argument here is whether the author's actions were proportional to the situation. \n\nIn some relationships, leaving like that could be seen as abandoning the partner in a stressful moment, which might be why Jill is upset. The author might have been trying to be responsible but didn't handle the emotional aspect well. So, there's a balance between being responsible and being considerate. \n\nThe author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to meet a commitment. However, their method of dealing with the problem\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could have been unnecessary. Maybe they could have communicated better, like discussing the time constraints more clearly or offering to help Jill get ready instead of getting frustrated. \n\nIn terms of AITA, often the person who is more proactive in causing stress or using harsh methods is considered at fault. So, even if Jill was late, the author's response of raising their voice and leaving might be where they're in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But I should also consider if the author had no other choice. If they couldn't delay, maybe they had to go. But leaving without Jill could be seen as selfish. \n\nHmm. Considering all that, I think the author's actions were reactive and not the best solution. They could have tried to problem-solve instead of just leaving. So the answer is A.\n"
