Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late. The situation is a bit of a common one where one person is more punctual and the other tends to be late.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready. The author waited until 4:00, then left. The key points here are the communication and the actions taken.\n\nThe author gave a heads-up about the time, which is good. But maybe they could have been more specific or firm earlier. Jill was aware of the time constraint but still thought she could manage. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, leaving their fianc\u00e9e when she's still getting ready does seem harsh, but considering the event start time, maybe he had a reason. The problem is the handling of the situation. Raising his voice was definitely a mistake. Even if he was stressed, yelling can be hurtful. Waiting until 4:00 shows he did wait, but maybe he could have tried to help her get ready instead of just leaving. \n\nAlso, the fact that he assumed the clothes would be dry might be part of the issue. He said \"probably but up to you,\" so maybe he's partially responsible if they weren't dry. But Jill was the one who decided to wait and see. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate the time, but maybe he should have been more supportive. Leaving her alone when she was still in the process of getting ready could be seen as abandoning her, even if he was trying to be on time. It might have been better to stay and help her finish or adjust the time if possible. \n\nHowever, the wedding was at a set time, and showing up late might be considered rude. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be the problem. Jill's defensiveness might come from feeling criticized when she already knows she's late, leading to her being upset. \n\nSo, the author did something wrong by yelling and leaving, but the situation is a bit mutual in terms of communication. Maybe both could have handled it better. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Given that he left her and raised his voice, which are hurtful actions, I think he is partially at fault. However, the main issue is Jill's repeated tendency to be late, which might be her responsibility. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's actions (yelling and leaving) are more blameworthy than Jill's time management. But in many cases, people would say that while being on time is important, the way to handle it shouldn't be to abandon the partner. So, likely the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
