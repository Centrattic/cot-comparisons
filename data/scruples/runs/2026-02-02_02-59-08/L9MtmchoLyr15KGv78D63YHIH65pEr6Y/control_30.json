Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often get late. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. But at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM to avoid missing the ceremony. Now, Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would be dry, and yelled. The author feels Jill is defensive and in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: communication, expectations, and handling of the situation. The author set a clear deadline (3:45) but maybe didn't account for possible delays. They gave a heads-up about the time, which is responsible. However, leaving when Jill wasn't ready could be seen as abandonment, but they had a valid reason to not miss the event. The yelling is a problem because raising your voice is not ideal, even under stress. But was the author's action of leaving justified? If they left to maintain punctuality and respect for the event, that's understandable. However, the method of handling it\u2014leaving without Jill\u2014might have been harsh. It's possible the author could have handled it better, like trying to help or adjusting the plan, but given the urgency, maybe leaving was the only option. Jill's responsibility to be ready on time is a factor too. She knew the deadline and didn't meet it. The author's frustration is valid, but the yelling adds to the conflict. So, is the author at fault for leaving, or for yelling, or both? The question is about leaving, though. If the author left to avoid being late, maybe they're not wrong. But if they left without considering Jill's situation, maybe they are. The answer might hinge on whether leaving was an acceptable solution given the circumstances. Also, perhaps the author should have communicated better or found another way. But given the time constraints, maybe leaving was necessary. The fact that they waited until 4:00 before leaving might be seen as reasonable. Jill's reaction is also important\u2014she might feel hurt by being left. The author's reasoning is that Jill is at fault for not being ready, which complicates the answer. The community might split here, but in AITA posts, often the person who takes action to stick to a commitment isn't the one at fault. However, the yelling is a red flag. So maybe the answer is a mix, but the main question is about leaving. Since the author left to be punctual and gave a clear warning, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the yelling makes part of their responsibility. However, the question is specifically about leaving. So perhaps the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they followed through on their commitment to be on time despite the conflict. The yelling is a separate issue, but the act of leaving was a decision to prioritize punctuality over staying and waiting.\n"
