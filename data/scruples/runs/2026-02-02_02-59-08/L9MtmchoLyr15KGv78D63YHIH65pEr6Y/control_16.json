Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context given is that Jill (the fianc\u00e9e) isn't good at budgeting time. The couple often ends up late or the author gets stressed when they're cutting it close. The author values punctuality and considers it rude to be late. The wedding they were attending was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to be on time. They also mentioned that if she needed two hours, she should start now. Jill said she'd be fine. Then, at 3:45, she was still naked, her clothes were slightly damp, and she wasn't ready. The author got upset, raised their voice, waited until 4:00, and left her to go to the wedding alone. Now, Jill is upset because the author is impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean by yelling. The author argues that Jill is being defensive and knows she's in the wrong.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Let me consider both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's side: They tried to warn Jill about the time, set clear expectations (leave by 3:45), and when she wasn't ready, they left to avoid being late to the wedding. They might feel frustrated due to past instances where Jill misjudges time, leading them to stress. Their reasoning is that they were trying to be respectful to the event and to others, and they couldn't wait beyond 4:00. They might see leaving as the only option given the time constraints and Jill's repeated procrastination.\n\nFrom Jill's side: She might feel hurt that her fianc\u00e9 left her, especially since they had a conversation about the time, and he told her the clothes would be dry by the time they needed to leave. She trusted his estimate and didn't start earlier. When he left, she was in an undressed state, which could be embarrassing. The yelling might have made her feel attacked, and she could perceive his impatience as a lack of understanding or support towards her. She might argue that the author should have given her more time despite past issues, or that he should have helped her instead of leaving.\n\nNow, considering the norms of relationships and communication. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if this is a recurring problem. However, leaving their partner behind in a vulnerable state (naked, with slightly damp clothes) might be seen as harsh. The author should have considered Jill's feelings and situation. Yelling adds to the conflict, even if the author was stressed. Instead of leaving, perhaps they could have found a middle ground, like agreeing on a later time if both were okay with it, or helping each other get ready. But given that the event started at 4:30 and the author had to leave by 3:45, leaving at 4:00 might have been the only option to avoid being extremely late. However, the way it was handled\u2014yelling and leaving her at home\u2014could be problematic. The author might be in the right for trying to be on time, but their method of handling the situation (raising voice, leaving her behind) could be seen as wrong. It's possible that both have some responsibility here. The author's impatience and the fianc\u00e9e's poor time management. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So, was leaving her at home the right choice? Maybe not. A better approach would have been to communicate more calmly and find a solution, but the author might have had to choose between being late and leaving. However, the key points here are the yelling and leaving her in that state. The author told her to start now if she needed two hours, but then waited until 4:00. Jill might have expected the author to wait a bit longer, even if she was running behind. The fact that she was still naked at 3:45 and the clothes were slightly damp suggests she was in the process of getting ready. The author's decision to leave could be impulsive and not considering Jill's actual state. In relationships, partners should support each other, so maybe the author should have waited a little longer and tried to help rather than just leaving. However, the author's reasoning about time is valid, but the execution might be where the problem lies. The yelling is definitely an issue. So, while the author's intention to be on time is reasonable, the way they handled the situation (yelling and leaving) is likely what's causing the conflict. Therefore, the author might share some blame, but maybe not entirely. The fianc\u00e9e's poor time management is a problem too. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, in terms of right and wrong, the answer could be that the author is partially at fault for the yelling and not being more supportive, but also the fianc\u00e9e is at fault for not managing her time. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). It's a bit of a gray area. The author left her, which could be seen as a breach of trust or support. But if the author was trying to be responsible and the fianc\u00e9e's behavior is a recurring issue, maybe the author is not entirely wrong. However, the way they left, without considering her situation, and yelling, makes the author at least partially responsible. But depending on the perspective, maybe the author is in the right because they prioritized the event's timing. I need to decide if the actions (leaving and yelling) make the author in the wrong. The community would probably say that while time management is a problem, the way the author handled it is wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
