Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, were going to a wedding that started at 4:30, 30 minutes away. The author mentioned that Jill isn't good with time management, and they often end up late. He wanted to avoid being late, which he finds disrespectful. They had a conversation around 1:30 where he warned her they needed to leave by 3:45. He even suggested doing laundry, but she insisted she'd be ready. By 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still in the nude. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 to get to the wedding on time. Now, Jill is upset, saying he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled at her. The author thinks she's being defensive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's actions and Jill's response. The author left because he didn't want to be late, which he sees as disrespectful. He did give multiple warnings. However, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling. Leaving her not dressed and with clothes still drying might have been a harsh action. While his intention was to be on time, the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. He didn't help her get ready or stay longer to accommodate her, which could have been a better approach. But he also had a valid concern about punctuality. It's a mix of both parties' issues. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but his yelling and leaving her in that state could be problematic. However, the situation is complex. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because he had a valid reason and the situation was stressful, but his methods were flawed. However, the community might split. Wait, the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the situation. The author left her in an unfinished state, which is risky and could be seen as abandoning her. So maybe A is the correct answer here. Alternatively, considering that he did warn her and left at 4:00, trying to be punctual, but still, leaving her without help might be wrong. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for leaving her in that state and yelling. But maybe it's B. Hmm. I'm a bit conflicted. Perhaps the main issue is that he didn't support her in her task instead of leaving, so he's at least partially in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. The answer is A or B? The user thinks A. I need to go with the situation's nuances. The author did raise his voice and left her in a vulnerable position. So A might be correct. But maybe the answer is B because he had a valid reason. I think the correct answer is A.\n"
