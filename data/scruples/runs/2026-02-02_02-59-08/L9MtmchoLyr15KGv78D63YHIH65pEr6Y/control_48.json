Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home to go to a wedding on time. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author told his fianc\u00e9e Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. She said she'd be ready, but at 3:45, she wasn't. He got upset, raised his voice, and left her at home to meet there. Now she's upset, thinking he was impatient, didn't account for the laundry, and was mean.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author values punctuality and sees being late as disrespectful. He communicated the time they needed to leave, and Jill didn't take it seriously. He got frustrated and left, but that left her in an awkward situation. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling, which is disrespectful. He also left her without ensuring she could get to the event another way. But he was trying to be on time. However, leaving her behind might have been an overreaction. He could have given her more time or found another solution instead of just leaving. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time well despite being warned. The author did set a clear deadline. But his response was to abandon her, which could be seen as selfish. Also, he didn't consider that maybe she needed more time, even if she had miscalculated. \n\nThe main issue here is communication. The author could have handled the situation better without raising his voice or leaving her. So, while Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's actions were also wrong. So the answer would probably be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
