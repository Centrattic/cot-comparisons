Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management and communication issues.\n\nFirst, the background: Jill isn't great at budgeting time, leading to frequent lateness or stress for the author. At a wedding, with a 30-minute drive, they needed to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 start. The author warned Jill at 1:30 to start getting ready early, but she said she'd be fine. When 3:45 hit, she wasn't ready, the author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there. Now, she's upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled. The author thinks she's deflected from her own fault.\n\nSo, who's at fault? Let's break it down. The author set a clear deadline (3:45) and gave a heads-up. Jill, despite being told to start early, didn't manage her time well. However, the author chose to raise his voice and leave without her, which could be seen as harsh. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's response might not have been the best. Leaving her alone at home, especially when she's not dressed and the event is about to start, could be seen as abandoning her, even if the intention was to be punctual. Additionally, yelling adds emotional distress to the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to uphold punctuality, which he values. He did give multiple warnings, and his frustration is understandable given their history. But the solution he chose\u2014leaving her\u2014might have been a poor decision. Perhaps a better approach would have been to wait a bit longer, communicate calmly, or find a compromise instead of escalating the situation.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if one person is at fault, how the conflict is handled matters. The author's actions might have been a result of stress, but they also contributed to the conflict. He might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room to argue that his response was inappropriate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he left her, which could be seen as a breach of support, and his raised voice, it's a mix. But according to common AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the person who acts inconsiderately despite the other's faults is often considered the asshole. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here because he could have handled it better. But there's also a case for him not being entirely at fault since Jill's negligence set the stage. Hmm.\n"
