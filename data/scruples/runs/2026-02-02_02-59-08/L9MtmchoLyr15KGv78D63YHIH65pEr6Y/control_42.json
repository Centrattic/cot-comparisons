Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author, let's call him Will, mentions that Jill isn't good with time management and they often end up late. He's concerned about being punctual and respectful to others. The wedding is 30 minutes away and starts at 4:30. They discussed leaving by 3:45 to be on time, but Jill wasn't ready by then. She was still in the process of getting dressed, her clothes were slightly damp, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00, saying he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here. Will warned Jill they needed to leave by 3:45. She assured him she'd be ready, but she wasn't. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the intended departure time. He left, but then she got upset. She's upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling. He thinks she's deflecting because she knows she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, is Will in the wrong? Let's think about responsibility. He gave a clear deadline and she didn't meet it. However, he also raised his voice in frustration, which could be seen as disrespectful. Leaving her might have been an overreaction, even if she was responsible for the time issue. The fact that he left without her, even if she was late, could be seen as abandonment or not supporting her during a stressful situation. On the other hand, he was trying to avoid being rude to others by being late. But in a relationship, communication and understanding are key. Maybe he should have tried to help her get ready or found another solution instead of leaving. Also, the yelling adds to the conflict. So, while Jill is responsible for not being ready on time, Will's actions\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have escalated the situation. It's possible that both have some responsibility here, but the question is whether Will is in the wrong. Since he chose to leave her, which could be seen as a harsh response, and raised his voice, he might be partially at fault. So the answer might be A (Yes), but I need to be sure. However, in some contexts, people might argue that he's not wrong because he followed his own timeline. But in a relationship, sometimes you have to be flexible and supportive, even if the other person isn't meeting expectations. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
