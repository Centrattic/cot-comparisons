Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is presented as a \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the story. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. The couple often ends up being late, which stresses the author. They had a conversation earlier that day about leaving at 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. The author reminded Jill to start getting ready in time. However, when 3:45 PM came, Jill wasn't ready, still in the nude, with slightly damp clothes. The author got upset, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling Jill they'd meet there. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not drying, and yelled at her. The author thinks Jill is being defensive because she's in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nTo determine this, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about being on time, which they see as important and respectful. They tried to give a heads-up, set a time, but Jill didn't manage her time. However, the author's actions\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014might be seen as harsh. Leaving the fianc\u00e9e alone at home could be seen as abandoning her, which is not supportive. Also, the author's frustration led to yelling, which is not ideal. But they were stressed about being late to a wedding, which is a significant event.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's behavior of not being ready, despite being warned, might be seen as irresponsible in terms of time management. However, the author's response of leaving her behind and yelling might have been an overreaction. It's possible that a better approach would have been to stay and help her get ready or find a compromise, rather than leaving her. Also, the author's assumption that the clothes would dry in time (since they said \"probably up to you\") might have contributed to the problem if they didn't account for possible delays.\n\nIn relationships, communication and support are key. The author's actions might be seen as impatience and a failure to support their partner during a stressful moment. Even if Jill was at fault for being unprepared, the way the author handled it could have been worse. Raising one's voice in frustration can be hurtful, and leaving someone at home might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they're not ready. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author had a right to expect their partner to follow through on the agreed time. If the wedding was important, and they wanted to be on time, then the author's actions could be seen as necessary to uphold their commitment. However, the method of handling it (yelling and leaving) might not be the best approach, but whether that makes them in the wrong depends on cultural or personal views on conflict resolution.\n\nIn many \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the person's actions are judged based on empathy and social norms. Leaving a partner alone because they're unprepared could be seen as a selfish move, even if the partner was at fault. The author's frustration is understandable, but the response might be considered unreasonable, especially if it caused emotional harm. The fact that they left their fianc\u00e9e in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready) could be a point against them. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be seen as the asshole for their reaction. They had a right to be upset about the lateness, but their method of dealing with it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be considered inconsiderate and harsh. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
