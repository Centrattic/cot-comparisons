Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, which leads to them being late. He values punctuality and finds it rude to be late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. They agreed he would leave at 3:45 latest. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 to meet there. Now, she's upset because he yelled, said clothes would dry, and is impatient. He thinks she's defensive.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nHe had concerns about being late and communicated the need to leave at 3:45. Jill assured him she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he got frustrated. He raised his voice and left. \n\nPossible issues: Communication. He told her the clothes would probably be dry but maybe didn't set clear expectations. He gave her a heads-up to start early, but perhaps didn't check in again. When she wasn't ready, he reacted with frustration, which led to yelling. Then, he left her, which might be seen as abandoning her, even if she was late.\n\nBut he also had a valid concern about punctuality. Weddings are important events, and showing up on time is a social norm. He tried to plan ahead. However, his response was to raise his voice and leave, which could be seen as harsh. Maybe there's a better way to handle the situation, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of reacting emotionally.\n\nJill's responsibility: If she knew she needed two hours, maybe she should have started earlier. But she might have underestimated her time. However, the author might have been too strict about the timeline. Also, he did give her a heads-up, but maybe not enough support.\n\nThe key points are communication and reaction. The author's yelling and leaving could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they are engaged and should be supportive. However, his intention was to be on time, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of accountability: Both could share some blame. Jill for not managing her time, the author for his reaction. But if the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong, then his actions\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be the main issue. Leaving her at home could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was late. Also, he might not have given her enough support or flexibility despite her known time-management issues.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were reactive and possibly hurtful. Even though he had a reason to be on time, his method of handling it (yelling and leaving) could make him the one in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
