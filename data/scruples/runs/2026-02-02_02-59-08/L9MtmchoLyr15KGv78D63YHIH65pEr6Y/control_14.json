Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that they left their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding they needed to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are that the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had discussed leaving by 3:45, but she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 when she was still not ready. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they were trying to avoid being late, which they find rude. They set a clear deadline, and when it passed, they left. Jill might have known the time constraint but didn't manage her time properly. However, raising their voice and leaving might have been harsh, even if the situation is frustrating. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's perspective is that she felt the author didn't help her dry the clothes, was impatient, and yelled. She might feel disrespected. The author did mention the time constraints multiple times, but maybe didn't follow through to ensure she was ready. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. Even if someone is right about another's actions, the way they respond matters. Yelling and leaving without ensuring the other person gets there might have been the problem. The author might see it as necessary to avoid being late, but the fianc\u00e9e could feel abandoned. \n\nI need to weigh if the author's actions, while perhaps understanding the frustration, crossed a line. Raising their voice and leaving might have been the wrong approach, even if the initial issue was Jill's time management. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for the way they handled it, even if the underlying issue was on Jill. Alternatively, if both sides have some responsibility, but the question is about the author specifically, maybe they are in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nHmm. The community might split. But in AITA scenarios, often the person who takes actions that cause emotional harm, even if justified, can be seen as at fault. So the author might be in the wrong for yelling and leaving, even if the initial problem was Jill's. So answer A.\n"
