Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The wedding is 30 minutes away and starts at 4:30. The author, let's call him Will, mentions they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. They had a conversation at 1:30 where Will offered to do laundry and reminded Jill to start her clothes early. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes are only slightly damp, she's not ready, and he gets upset. He yells, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, past behavior, and the decision to leave. The user is the author, and they argue that Jill is being defensive because she's in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he raised his voice, said the clothes would be dry, and left her. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, Will gave a clear deadline and reminded her multiple times. Jill said she'd be okay but didn't manage her time properly. However, when the time came, Will got frustrated and raised his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is not okay regardless of the situation. Then he left her, but they had time to get to the wedding. He could have waited longer, but he left at 4:00, which is still 45 minutes before the start time. \n\nIs leaving her at home the wrong choice? Well, he was trying to be responsible and avoid being late, which he considers disrespectful. But he did raise his voice, which is a valid issue. However, the act of leaving her might be seen as abandonment or not supportive. But given that they had a history of this, maybe it's a recurring issue where he's trying to hold her accountable. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill might be responsible for her time management, but when faced with a crisis, the partner's role is to be supportive. Maybe Will could have handled it differently, like helping her get ready instead of just leaving. Also, the fact that he told her the clothes would be dry might have led to her not preparing properly, so that's a point where he could have been clearer.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have some faults. Will raised his voice, which is unkind, but Jill didn't meet the time expectations. However, the act of leaving her could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they were both supposed to go together. But the user's reasoning is that he wanted to be on time and didn't want to be late. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the question is whether the author is at fault. Since he did yell and left her, even if he had good intentions, those actions are problematic. However, the situation is complex. If the answer is A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No).\n\nI think the key here is that while Jill's time management is an issue, the author's response (yelling and leaving) is also a problem. But the main question is about leaving her. If the wedding is 30 minutes away and he left at 4:00, he had time to get there, but did he have to leave her behind? Maybe he could have waited longer or helped her. By leaving, he didn't support her through the problem. So, even though she's at fault for not being ready, his actions also contributed to the conflict. Therefore, he's partially in the wrong. But the user might argue that he was trying to be responsible. However, the act of leaving her, especially after yelling, is a key point here. So, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation supportively and left her, escalating the problem.\n"
