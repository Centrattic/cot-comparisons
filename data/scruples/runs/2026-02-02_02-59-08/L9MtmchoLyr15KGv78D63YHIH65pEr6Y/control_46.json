Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the background: The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. They needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The author warned Jill to start getting ready by 1:30, but she wasn't ready by 4:00. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left alone. Now, Jill is upset about being left, the yelling, and not meeting the time commitment.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author wanted to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. He set a clear time and gave a heads-up. However, he did raise his voice, which is a problem. Yelling can be seen as disrespectful or aggressive, regardless of the situation. Leaving Jill alone might not be the right approach either, especially in a relationship context. Perhaps a better solution would be to find a compromise, like calling someone to let them know they'll be late instead of leaving Jill behind. \n\nOn Jill's side, she might have misjudged the time needed, but she's not completely wrong if the laundry didn't dry as expected. However, the author had given her a clear deadline. \n\nThe key points: The author left to avoid being late, which he values, but his method involved yelling and abandonment. The question is whether his actions were justified. While punctuality is important, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might be seen as harsh. Relationships require communication and understanding. If this is a recurring issue, they might need to discuss better time management strategies together. \n\nSo, the author made a mistake by yelling and leaving. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's response could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
