Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home to get ready for a wedding they were going to be late for. \n\nFirst, the author set a clear time to leave: 3:45 PM. He even warned her earlier that if she needed two hours, she should start immediately. She said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked.\n\nHe got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00 PM, arriving at the wedding on time. Now, she's upset because he was impatient, didn't make her clothes dry (even though he told her they might not be), and yelled. The author thinks she's deflecting and that she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did he have a responsibility to wait longer, or was she responsible for managing her time? He set a time based on their previous issues, which she agreed to. She didn't meet the deadline, so he left. But he did raise his voice, which is a red flag. \n\nLeaving her at home to go to the wedding without her could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). That's not just about being on time; it's about caring for her safety and dignity. Even if she was at fault for not managing her time, the author's decision to leave without her might have been hasty and uncaring. \n\nAlso, he told her the clothes might not be dry, so he's not entirely off the hook there. But the main issue is leaving her in a state where she couldn't go with him. The argument is more about his actions versus her time management. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if she's late, walking out might not be the best solution. He could have waited longer but decided to go alone. That might be seen as selfish. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he handled it, despite her time management issues.\n"
