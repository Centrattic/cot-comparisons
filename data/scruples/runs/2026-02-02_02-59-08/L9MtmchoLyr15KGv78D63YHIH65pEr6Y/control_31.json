Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding. The situation is that they were running late, and the fianc\u00e9e wasn't ready on time despite being warned to start early. The author waited until 4:00, then left her at home.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had given a heads-up that they needed to leave by 3:45. The fianc\u00e9e said she would be fine, but then wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, made a comment about the clothes being dry, and yelled.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author was concerned about being on time, which is reasonable. However, he did raise his voice in frustration, which is a problem. Also, leaving her at home\u2014especially when she was still in the process of getting ready\u2014could be seen as abandoning her, which might cause her distress. \n\nBut then again, if the fianc\u00e9e had a history of poor time management and the author had given multiple warnings, maybe he felt it was her own fault. But leaving her at home isn't exactly a solution. He could have tried to communicate better, maybe stayed a bit longer or called someone to help her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the fianc\u00e9e is being defensive because she knows she's in the wrong. But the act of leaving someone at home because they're not ready on time might be considered harsh, regardless of the circumstances. It's a breach of trust and support, especially in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the comment about the clothes drying\u2014did he promise they would be dry? The fianc\u00e9e is holding him accountable for that. If he said \"probably dry\" but left it up to her, maybe that was ambiguous. The author might have contributed to the problem by not ensuring the laundry was actually done in time.\n\nIn terms of conflict resolution, raising one's voice is not ideal. Even if frustrated, yelling can escalate the situation. So, the author's actions\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could both be seen as contributing to the problem.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author tried to communicate the importance of punctuality, but his approach (yelling and leaving) was inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9e's poor time management is an issue, but the author's response could have been better handled. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he left her at home and raised his voice, which are both unhelpful actions in a relationship. Even if she was at fault for being late, the way he handled it was problematic.\n"
