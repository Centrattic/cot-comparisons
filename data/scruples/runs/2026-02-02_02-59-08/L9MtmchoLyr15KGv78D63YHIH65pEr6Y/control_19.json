Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: They had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM to arrive on time. Jill was still getting ready at 3:45, her clothes were slightly damp, and the fianc\u00e9 got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM. Now, Jill is upset, feeling he's impatient and mean for yelling. The author thinks she's making excuses because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are time management, communication, and conflict resolution. The author set a clear deadline (3:45 PM), reminded Jill earlier. Jill said she'd be fine, but didn't meet that deadline. The fianc\u00e9, frustrated, left to meet the commitment on time. \n\nBut where's the fault? The author raised his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is disrespectful regardless of the situation. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready on time, the author's reaction of yelling crosses a line. Also, leaving her at home could be seen as abandoning her, which might not be the best solution. However, the conflict isn't entirely on the author's side\u2014Jill did not meet her responsibilities. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. While Jill's time management is an issue, the author's actions\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be seen as the immediate cause of the conflict. So, it's a shared responsibility, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because the yelling and leaving are problematic actions. Alternatively, maybe B (No) if the author is justified in his frustration. \n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, often the person's actions that cause immediate harm (like yelling) are considered wrong, even if the other party contributed. So the author's yelling and leaving could be the main issue here, making him at least partially in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A.\n"
