Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, context: The author, let's call him Will, mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, has a history of poor time management. They often end up being late or almost late because she doesn't plan her time well. For this particular wedding, they had to leave by 3:45 PM to arrive on time. Will reminded Jill early about the laundry and the departure time. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready, clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding himself.\n\nThe main points here: Will's intention was to be punctual, which he values. Jill's behavior is consistent with her past issues, and he's frustrated. He left her at home after waiting until 4:00. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom Will's perspective, he's trying to respect the event's timing and not be disrespectful. He might feel that he's made a reasonable effort to accommodate Jill's tendencies by giving her a heads-up and waiting longer than necessary. However, by leaving her, he's abandoning her, which could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. Even if she was responsible for the delay, taking his frustration out by leaving might not be the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill is upset because he raised his voice, didn't ensure the clothes would be dry, and was mean. She might feel that he didn't support her enough and took it out on her. The fact that he left her at home could be hurtful, especially since they were supposed to attend the event together. It's about mutual respect and communication. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, Will's response of leaving might not be constructive. He could have tried to talk through it or help her manage her time instead of just taking off.\n\nIt's also important to consider the relationship dynamics. They're engaged, so actions like this can have a bigger impact. Will's decision to leave might be seen as prioritizing punctuality over his partner's feelings. While his intention was to be on time, the method he used could be problematic. Maybe he should have approached the situation differently, like helping her get ready or making arrangements to attend the wedding together later.\n\nIn conclusion, while Jill's time management is an issue, Will's reaction of leaving her and raising his voice is not ideal. He might have a point about wanting to be punctual, but his actions could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because leaving her at home was a harsh response, even if she's at fault for the delay.\n"
