Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he left his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. He wanted to be on time, but she wasn't ready. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's reasoning is that he thought they should be punctual and that being late is disrespectful. He tried to prepare her by reminding her to start getting ready early, but she didn't. He got upset and left. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, which is a known issue. The author raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, and that's probably hurtful. Also, he left her naked and unready at home, which might be embarrassing for her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and conflict resolution. The author escalated the situation by yelling, which is not a good way to handle stress. Even if he was frustrated, raising his voice isn't appropriate. Also, leaving her alone when she's not ready might have been a solution to make it on time, but it's a harsh action. They are engaged, so this behavior could cause lasting hurt. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is understandable too; she might feel disrespected and abandoned. The author's argument that she's being defensive because she's in the wrong is a bit of a projection. He could have handled the situation differently, like trying to calm down, helping her get ready, or maybe even adjusting their schedule if possible. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation of being on time. While punctuality is important, relationships require flexibility and understanding. The fact that this is a recurring issue suggests that maybe they need to find a better way to manage their time together rather than the author taking this extreme step. Leaving her in that state might have been a mistake, both in terms of their relationship and her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author made a poor decision by yelling and leaving her. He could have addressed the problem without being harsh. Therefore, he's at least partially in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's time management issues are a problem too, but the author's response was not constructive.\n"
