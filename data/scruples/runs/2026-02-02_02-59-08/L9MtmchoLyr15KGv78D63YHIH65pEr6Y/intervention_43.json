Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author, let's call him Will, is frustrated because Jill has a history of poor time management, leading them to be late. He planned to leave at 3:45, gave her a heads-up, and when she wasn't ready by 4:00, he left without her. He raised his voice in frustration, which he acknowledges as a wrongdoing.\n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling. She feels he left her behind, which is hurtful. The author believes she's in the wrong, but he's unsure.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author's intention was to avoid being late, which he values as respectful. However, his actions\u2014leaving her after raising his voice\u2014could be seen as harsh. Even though Jill was unprepared, the author could have handled the situation differently. For example, he could have stayed until she was ready, even if it meant arriving late, or perhaps offered more help earlier. \n\nThe fact that he left her naked and not ready is a significant issue. While timing is important, personal dignity and support in a relationship matter too. The raised voice adds to the tension. The author is in a committed relationship, so communication and patience are crucial. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's responsibility to manage her time and prepare adequately is also a factor. But the author's response escalated the problem. The question is whether his actions were justified given their history. While it's understandable to be frustrated, leaving her behind without support might be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a close relationship.\n\nSo, the author has some valid points about their recurring issue, but his actions in this specific instance could be seen as the wrong approach. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because leaving her in that state and the yelling were hurtful, even if the frustration is understandable.\n"
