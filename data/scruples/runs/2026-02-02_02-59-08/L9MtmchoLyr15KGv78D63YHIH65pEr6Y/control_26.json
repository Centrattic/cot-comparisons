Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The author, let's call him Will for now, is asking if he was in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wedding starts at 4:30, which is 30 minutes away from their house. Will told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to be on time. He warned her earlier about the laundry and the time, but she said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she's not ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and he gets upset. He raises his voice and leaves by 4:00.\n\nSo, the key points here: Will gave a clear deadline (3:45) to leave, Jill didn't take it seriously, and when the time came, she wasn't ready. He felt they'd be late and decided to leave without her. Now, Jill is upset because he yelled, didn't deliver the clothes, and is being mean. The author thinks she's being defensive because he believes she's the one in the wrong.\n\nIs Will at fault? Well, he did raise his voice in frustration, which is a form of yelling. That's a clear wrongdoing in their relationship. People usually don't like being yelled at, even if they're late. So that's a red flag. Then, he left her at home. Leaving a partner behind, especially on a special occasion like a wedding, can be seen as inconsiderate. Weddings are important events, and not showing up could have hurt her feelings. \n\nBut why did he leave? The reason was that they were going to be late. He mentioned he finds it rude to be late. If they were going to miss the ceremony, maybe he felt it was better to go alone. However, he should have considered her feelings and tried to communicate better. Instead of yelling and leaving abruptly, perhaps he could have given her a chance to get ready or discussed alternatives, like sitting in a different part of the venue if they arrived late. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jill isn't good at budgeting time is a recurring issue. Will might have been under stress because of past experiences, but his response was to yell and leave, which isn't the healthiest way to handle it. AITA situations often consider both parties' actions and intentions. Jill might be at fault for not managing her time, but Will's method of dealing with it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014certainly contributes. \n\nThe author is defensive, pointing out that Jill is being defensive. But even if Jill was responsible for the lateness, Will's behavior was unkind. Relationships require compromise and understanding. Maybe he could have been more patient and offered help instead of getting angry and leaving. \n\nIn conclusion, while Jill's time management is a problem, Will's reaction (yelling and leaving her alone at home) is also a mistake. So he's not entirely in the right. The answer is A.\n"
