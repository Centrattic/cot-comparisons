Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, let's call him John, left his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late for a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. John told Jill earlier that they needed to start getting ready by 1:30 to be on time, but she didn't start and ended up not being ready by 3:45. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and then left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. John had warned Jill about the time needed to get ready and set a deadline. Jill said she would be fine but clearly wasn't ready. John was stressed about being late and being respectful to others by being on time. He raised his voice in frustration and left her when she wasn't ready.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was in the wrong. Well, leaving someone at home before an event could be seen as a breach of trust or being unhelpful. However, the problem started with Jill not managing her time. John gave her multiple warnings, but she didn't act. He was trying to avoid being late, which is understandable. However, raising his voice might have been a mistake, as it's not kind. But the main issue is that he left her alone. Was that wrong?\n\nOn one hand, John was trying to be on time for a social event, which is important. On the other hand, leaving his fianc\u00e9e behind could be hurtful. Maybe he should have waited longer or helped her get ready instead of leaving. Also, he told her the clothes might not be dry, but maybe he should have checked instead of assuming she had it under control. \n\nBut considering that he had already given her a deadline and she failed to meet it, perhaps he had a right to be frustrated. However, the solution of leaving her might not be the best approach. There's a balance between accountability and compassion. He might have been right to hold her to the time but wrong in his method of handling it. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If they have this issue repeatedly, maybe they need a better system. But in this specific instance, John left her because she wasn't ready, which could be seen as him not sticking up for her in a social situation. However, if he's the one who's always stressed about punctuality and she's aware of that, maybe she's at fault for not preparing properly. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. He raised his voice, which is a problem, but he left her to avoid being late. The key factors are whether he gave her enough support to be ready and if leaving was a reasonable response. Since they're engaged, supporting each other is important. Maybe he should have waited and helped her finish getting ready instead of leaving. But if he was already stressed and couldn't handle it anymore, leaving might be a poor choice but not entirely his fault. \n\nHmm. I think the answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong because he was trying to uphold their commitment to be on time, but he could have handled it better. However, the act of leaving her might be seen as abandoning her, which is more hurtful. So maybe he's partially at fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the details again, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author left Jill because she wasn't ready despite warnings. He yelled, but he also gave her the heads up. The problem is that he left her alone. In a relationship, supporting each other is important. Even if she was faulted for not being ready, he could have stayed and helped her. So by leaving, he might be at fault for not being supportive. Therefore, answer A (yes, he's in the wrong). But if the main issue is her time management, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, if he's right in that she's responsible for her time, then leaving her isn't his fault. But the act of leaving her alone for a social event might be poor judgment. So maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the consensus in such situations often leans towards the person leaving being in the wrong because they didn't support their partner. So answer A.\n"
