Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good with time management, and they often end up late. The wedding started at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45. The author gave a heads up about the time, but Jill didn't take it seriously. When the time came, she wasn't ready, the clothes were slightly damp, and the author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her at home.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and conflict resolution. The author clearly communicated the need to leave on time, and Jill wasn't prepared. However, the author raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling, and then left her alone. Even though the author might feel justified due to Jill's repeated lateness, the response might be considered harsh. \n\nLeaving someone alone at home because they didn't meet a time constraint could be seen as abandoning them in a stressful situation. The author could have handled the situation differently, like trying to help her get ready, offering alternatives, or maybe even staying to support her through the stress instead of leaving. \n\nAlso, the author's frustration led to yelling, which is a form of emotional harm. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's reaction might be inconsiderate. In a committed relationship, it's important to manage conflicts without escalating them to the point of isolation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that punctuality is important and that they had to take responsibility for their own part in being on time. But the method of leaving Jill behind might have caused more emotional damage than the lateness itself. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while perhaps driven by frustration and a desire to be respectful to the wedding guests, might have been an overly harsh response. It's about balancing personal responsibility with empathy towards the other person's feelings and circumstances.\n"
