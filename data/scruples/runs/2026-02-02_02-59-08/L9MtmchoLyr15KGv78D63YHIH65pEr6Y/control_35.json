Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main points are: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which is 30 minutes away. The author told Jill to start getting ready by 1:30 PM because they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill didn't start on time, and at 3:45, she was still not ready, with her clothes slightly damp. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, arriving without her. Now Jill is upset, saying he's impatient, didn't account for the laundry not drying, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo the author is asking if they're at fault. Let's consider both sides. The author tried to plan ahead, set a clear deadline, and communicated the need to leave on time. They were stressed about being late, which they consider rude. On the other hand, Jill didn't follow through with the timeline, leading to the conflict. \n\nBut the author did raise their voice, which adds to the tension. Even if Jill was responsible for being late, yelling can be hurtful. However, the author made an effort to warn her multiple times. Maybe the key issue is the communication style. Yelling is never ideal, but the author's intention was to be punctual. \n\nAlso, leaving without her means he went to the wedding alone, which might be a valid choice to keep to the commitment of the event's start time. However, abandoning a partner in a situation like this could be seen as dismissive, especially if she was also committed to attending. \n\nBut considering that they both were going together, maybe the author should have waited a bit more, given that clothes being slightly damp isn't a huge issue. Alternatively, maybe Jill should have started earlier. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the situation, the author tried to set expectations and plan ahead, but the yelling is a negative point. However, the main issue is the decision to leave, which might be seen as necessary to avoid being late. \n\nBut in relationships, communication and consideration are key. Yelling and leaving without a partner could be seen as impatience and a lack of support. On the other hand, respecting commitments (like being on time to a wedding) is also important. \n\nHmm. This is a tough call. Some people might side with the author because they took responsibility for being on time, while others might think the author should have been more understanding and helped Jill get ready. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who made the effort to plan and follow through is seen less at fault, but the yelling is a negative. However, leaving a partner behind could be seen as selfish. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they communicated the timeline and tried to make plans. However, the yelling and leaving might not have been the best approach. But given the context of needing to be on time, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle is that the author could have handled the situation better without yelling, but the decision to leave might be justified. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, since they left her behind, maybe A. \n\nWait, but in the scenario, they were both going to the wedding together. Leaving her there might mean she had to go later, which could be inconvenient. But the author's main point is about respecting the event's timing. \n\nI think the key factors are: did the author handle the situation with consideration? The yelling is a problem, but the decision to leave might be seen as necessary. However, in a romantic relationship, being supportive is important. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't support Jill and handled it poorly with yelling and leaving her. Alternatively, if they had waited a bit more, that would have been better. \n\nBut in the end, the author made a choice to prioritize being on time over waiting for Jill. Depending on the cultural context, being punctual is important, so perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But the way they handled the frustration is a problem. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he left her, and she got upset, but he tried to plan. I think the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), but he could have handled it better. However, in AITA, sometimes the person is considered AITA if their actions caused significant harm. In this case, leaving her there might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI'm a bit conflicted. But leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he had a valid reason to be on time, communicated clearly, and the main fault is on Jill for not following through. The yelling is a minor issue but not the main point. So the answer would be B.\n"
