Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves a disagreement over time management and communication.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, leading to frequent lateness. They had agreed that Jill would start her wedding outfit's laundry earlier so that the two of them could leave by 3:45 PM to be on time for the 4:30 PM wedding. When 3:45 hits, Jill isn't ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and the author gets frustrated. He raises his voice and leaves at 4:00 PM, which is 30 minutes before the event, to avoid being late. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, responsibility, and the actual actions taken. The author gave a heads-up about the time, which is 3:45, and told Jill to start her laundry if it would take two hours. Jill said she'd be fine, which implies she took responsibility for her own timing. However, the author might have assumed that the laundry would dry in time, but Jill didn't account for that properly. The problem is, the author left without her, which could be seen as abandoning her, even if they were going to be late.\n\nNow, considering the author's frustration and the importance of punctuality, but also the fact that they left Jill alone, maybe in an embarrassing state (naked, clothes not dry), that's a problem. Raising one's voice is also an issue in the communication. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing to be on time, but leaving a fianc\u00e9e home, especially when she's not ready, could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, maybe the author should have checked if the dryer was going to finish in time instead of just assuming. Jill might be at fault for not managing her time, but the author's actions of leaving her behind and yelling could also be seen as wrong. The question is whether the author overstepped by leaving her home unprepared. The answer is probably AITA, so maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. But since the user wants a choice between A or B, maybe it's a mix, but the main question is if the author is in the wrong. I think the author made a mistake by leaving, even if Jill was responsible for her time. The act of leaving a partner home in that situation might be more inconsiderate than just being late. So the answer would be A.\n"
