Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a conversation earlier about leaving by 3:45. The author even warned her about the time, but she still wasn't ready. At 3:45, she's not ready, so the author gets frustrated, raises their voice, and leaves alone. Now, Jill is upset because the author yelled, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and left her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home, raised their voice in frustration, and is now being accused of impatience. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to be on time, which is respectful to the hosts and guests. However, the method of leaving without Jill might have been harsh. Raising their voice and leaving her alone could be seen as dismissive or inconsiderate, even if the author is stressed about being late. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill isn't managing her time well, despite prior warnings. The author did give her a heads-up about the time. But even if someone is late, the partner doesn't have to leave them. The author could have tried to help her get ready or communicated better instead of leaving. \n\nLeaving a fianc\u00e9e alone in that situation might cause emotional distress. Even if the author is right about the time management, the way they handled it could be seen as wrong. Relationships require empathy, and maybe the author should have considered Jill's feelings more.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to yelling, which is a negative aspect. So even if the reason for leaving was valid (avoiding being late), the manner in which it was done contributes to the conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, while both parties have their points, the author's actions (yelling and leaving) might be considered in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
