Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The scenario is posted as an AITA question.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author, let's call him Will, mentioned that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a prior conversation where Will set a departure time of 3:45 to make it to the wedding on time. Jill didn't start her laundry early, and when 3:45 hits, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's not ready. Will gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves alone.\n\nFrom Will's perspective, he was trying to be respectful by leaving on time. He gave Jill a heads-up and set a clear time, but she didn't follow through. He felt that being late was disrespectful to the wedding guests, so he made the decision to leave without her. He might argue that he's held back frustration from previous similar situations and this was a last resort.\n\nJill's perspective, as presented, is that she's stressed about the situation, feels Will was impatient, didn't allow her time to get ready properly, and that he was mean by yelling. She might also be upset about the logistical issue with the laundry\u2014maybe she trusted that the clothes would dry in time, but Will didn't account for that possibility.\n\nNow, considering the rules of respect and communication. Will did communicate the departure time in advance, but maybe he could have been more understanding. However, Jill didn't manage her time as discussed. The act of leaving her at home could be seen as abandonment, but maybe Will felt it was necessary to keep his commitment to be on time.\n\nRaising his voice is a negative point. Even if frustrated, yelling is unkind and could escalate the situation. However, the main issue is the decision to leave her. Is that inconsiderate? Well, they were going together, so leaving her behind might be seen as selfish if she wasn't ready. But if the alternative is being late for the wedding, which is a significant event, perhaps he felt he had to prioritize that.\n\nHowever, in a relationship, communication and support are key. Leaving her alone in a stressful situation might not be the best choice. Maybe he could have stayed a bit longer to help her get ready, even if it meant being slightly late. Or perhaps he could have adjusted the timeline earlier if he saw she was struggling.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are his communication (he did set expectations), his frustration (which led to yelling), and the decision to leave. While he had a reason to be on time, the way he handled it may have been harsh. The fact that he left her alone might have been the wrong choice, especially given the emotional impact on her. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because leaving her behind after raising his voice was unkind and not supportive. However, if the alternative is being late to a wedding, it's a tough decision. But in relationships, partners should support each other even in tough situations. Therefore, he might be in the right if the priority was on time, but the method was wrong. Hmm, conflicting thoughts.\n\nAnother angle: if he left her, maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. While punctuality is important, relationships require flexibility. So, he might be in the wrong for not being more accommodating despite her time management issues. But she also had prior knowledge and didn't manage her time. It's a bit of a grey area. However, yelling and leaving her could be seen as his fault. So, answer A.\n"
