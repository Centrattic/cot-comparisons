Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e because she wasn't ready on time. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and Jill had agreed that they needed to leave by 3:45 to make the 4:30 wedding on time. The author gave a heads-up at 1:30, telling Jill to start her laundry two hours earlier. Jill said she'd be fine, and the author assumed she would be ready. When 3:45 hit, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were still slightly damp, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left to go to the wedding alone. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe author's main points are that they were trying to be on time and respectful to others, and that Jill knew she needed to start earlier. They feel Jill is defensive because she's at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider communication and actions. Did the author handle the situation appropriately? Let's look at possible issues. The author gave a clear timeframe and a heads-up. Jill, however, didn't follow through. The problem arises when the author raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling, even if they were frustrated. Yelling can be disrespectful, regardless of the situation. Then, leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready might seem harsh, but the author's intention was to not be late to the wedding. However, leaving without ensuring she could get there safely or with support might not be the best approach.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author could have tried to understand why Jill wasn't ready, maybe offered help, or found another solution instead of leaving. Raising their voice might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. On the other hand, Jill also has responsibility for time management. But in a relationship, how we handle stress and conflicts matters. The author's frustration led to an action that hurt the relationship, even if their goal was to be punctual.\n\nSo, while Jill's time management is an issue, the author's response\u2014raising their voice, leaving abruptly\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. They might have handled it better. Therefore, the author is somewhat in the wrong for their reaction and the way they left, even if the situation was frustrating. So the answer is A.\n"
