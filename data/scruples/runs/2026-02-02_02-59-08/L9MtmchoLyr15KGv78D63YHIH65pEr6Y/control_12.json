Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time. Let me start by looking at the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's side: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away starting at 4:30 PM. They told Jill to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. Jill agreed she'd be ready, but at 3:45, she's still not dressed, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves by 4:00. He's upset because they're always late due to her time management, and he values punctuality as a sign of respect.\n\nNow, Jill's perspective: She might feel that the author didn't support her during this stressful time. She trusted his earlier assurance that the laundry would be dry, but maybe the machine took longer, or something else happened. She's upset that he yelled and left her, which could feel like abandonment, even if they were going to be late. She might also feel that he didn't give her enough time to finish getting ready, especially if the clothes were just slightly damp and could have dried in time.\n\nLooking at the key points: The author set a clear deadline, but Jill wasn't ready. He raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, and left. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, showing up late to an event can be seen as disrespectful, and the author wanted to avoid that. He tried to set expectations in advance, which is reasonable. However, raising his voice and leaving Jill alone, especially in a stressful situation where she might be embarrassed or overwhelmed, could be seen as harsh. Also, he might have underestimated the time she needed, or maybe the laundry situation wasn't entirely within her control. \n\nAnother angle: The fact that this is a recurring issue suggests a communication problem. Maybe the author and Jill need to find a solution together, like building in more buffer time or addressing the root of her time management issues. But in this specific instance, the author's reaction could be seen as a knee-jerk response. Yelling and leaving could be hurtful, even if the intention was to be on time.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Jill is defensive because she knows she's in the wrong. But maybe she's defensive because she feels the author is being overly strict or not considering her perspective. The author might not have considered that Jill's stress could affect her performance in getting ready, or that his reaction might have made her feel unsupported. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had a valid concern about being on time and tried to plan accordingly. However, the method he used\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been excessive. The outcome of their actions (missing part of the wedding) isn't clear, but the emotional impact on Jill is significant. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the means justify the ends. If he believed leaving was the only way to be on time, but his approach was hurtful, then maybe he shares some responsibility. Alternatively, if he should have given her more time or helped her instead of reacting angrily, that's another point. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are key. The author might not be entirely wrong, but his reaction could have been handled better. However, the question is about being in the \"wrong\" in the situation. Since he did raise his voice and left her without assistance, that could be seen as a mistake, making him at least partially responsible.\n"
