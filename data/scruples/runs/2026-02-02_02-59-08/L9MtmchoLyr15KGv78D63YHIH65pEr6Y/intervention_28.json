Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, looking at the timeline: The wedding starts at 4:30 PM. The author mentions they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. At 1:30 PM, he checks on the laundry and gives a heads up about the departure time. Jill says she'll be fine. Then, at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets upset. He yells, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's frustrated because this is a recurring issue with Jill's time management. He considers it disrespectful to be late and thinks she's being defensive. He argues that he's not in the wrong because she knew the time and didn't prepare accordingly.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they think the author is in the wrong but want others' opinions. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No).\n\nFactors to consider: Communication, accountability, and the impact of his actions. The author set a clear deadline, but Jill didn't meet it. However, he raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, which can be hurtful. Leaving her alone in that state (naked, clothes not dry) might have been abrupt and could be seen as abandonment. The fianc\u00e9 might have overstepped by not giving her more time or helping her instead of leaving. On the other hand, he tried to set the timeline in advance. \n\nBut the key points are that he yelled, left her in an unfinished state, and didn't consider her well-being after his frustration. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's handling of the situation\u2014raising his voice and leaving without ensuring she's okay\u2014could make him equally at fault. The question is whether his actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. While being on time is important, the way he handled the situation might have been too harsh. The fact that he left her at 4:00, knowing the wedding starts at 4:30, and she might have needed more time to get ready, could have caused her to be even more stressed. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't account for her situation after his initial frustration, even if she was responsible for her time management. So the answer might lean towards A.\n"
