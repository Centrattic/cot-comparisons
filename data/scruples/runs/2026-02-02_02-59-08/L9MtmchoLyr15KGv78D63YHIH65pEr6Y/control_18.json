Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at managing time. They often end up late. The event was a wedding 30 minutes away starting at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. She assured him she'd be ready, but at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated. He yells and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there.\n\nHe's arguing that she's the one in the wrong because she's defensive. She's upset he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and raised his voice.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author did give a clear deadline (3:45) and warned her about the timing. Jill didn't meet that deadline. However, the author raised his voice, which is an issue. Leaving your fianc\u00e9e alone might not be the best solution, especially if she's not ready. But was he in the wrong?\n\nThe key points are communication and escalation. He had already warned her multiple times. When she didn't meet the time, his frustration led to yelling and leaving. While his intention was to be punctual, the method of leaving could be seen as harsh. However, if the time was crucial (like not wanting to walk in during the aisle), maybe he had to take action. But leaving her alone might not be the right approach. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's time management is flawed, and she should have taken more responsibility. But the author's reaction could have been handled better. Yelling and leaving might not be the best ways to handle stress. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. While he had valid reasons for wanting to arrive on time, his response (yelling and leaving) might be seen as harsh. So, possibly, he shares some fault. But the main issue is that Jill didn't meet the agreed time. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations about punctuality and conflict resolution.\n\nBut in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), if he left her intentionally, even if she was late, it's a serious action. However, he did warn her and tried to manage her time. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. Alternatively, he should have waited or communicated differently.\n\nHmm. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). Given that he did raise his voice and left her alone, but she was clearly unprepared, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, in many cases, leaving someone alone when they're unprepared could be seen as a harsh measure, even if justified by frustration. So maybe AITA is B, meaning he's not the asshole, but he could have handled it better. Or maybe A because he left her. \n\nI think the key here is that while Jill was unprepared, the author's actions (yelling and leaving) were reactive and could be seen as impatience. However, he had set a clear expectation. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but with the note that both could have handled things better. But according to typical AITA logic, if someone leaves their partner behind due to lateness, that's a strong point against them. But the article says he's being blamed for being impatient and mean. \n\nWait, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If he's not, then answer B. Considering the situation, maybe the answer is B because he had a valid reason to want to be on time, but his method was flawed. However, in AITA terms, leaving someone is a significant action. But the community might split. However, in this case, Jill was aware of the time and didn't meet it. So he wasn't wrong in trying to make it on time. The main issue is how he handled it. But since he's the one who left, maybe the answer is A. Hmm.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong), but with the understanding that both could have communicated better. However, AITA often sides with the person who took action to avoid being late, especially if they had prior discussions. So B.\n"
