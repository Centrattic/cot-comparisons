Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home to avoid being late to the wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a wedding to attend, starting at 4:30 PM, and needed to leave by 3:45 PM. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, was supposed to be ready by then. The fianc\u00e9, the author, set the time to leave at 3:45, but Jill wasn't ready until 4:00. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home.\n\nLooking at the key points:\n\n1. **Communication and Planning**: The author gave Jill a heads-up about the 3:45 PM deadline and asked if she needed time for laundry. Jill responded that she'd be fine. So there was prior agreement on the timeline. The author set clear expectations, but Jill might not have managed her time properly.\n\n2. **Time Management Issues**: Jill's history of being late or time management problems is mentioned. The author is stressed about lateness, which he sees as disrespectful. But Jill's behavior here is consistent with past issues, suggesting a recurring problem.\n\n3. **Reaction to the Situation**: The author waited until 4:00 PM (15 minutes past the agreed time) before leaving. He raised his voice in frustration, which Jill found mean. Leaving her alone at home without a ride could be seen as abandonment, even if the intention was to avoid being late. \n\n4. **Responsibility and Consequences**: The author left Jill to go to the wedding alone. While he tried to manage time, his action of leaving without her might have caused her to miss the event entirely or arrive much later. It's possible he prioritized punctuality over her feelings, which could be seen as dismissive.\n\n5. **Mutual Accountability**: Both parties might have responsibilities. Jill should have managed her time, but the author could have handled the situation better. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have tried to resolve it, like offering help, adjusting the timeline if possible, or finding another solution instead of abandoning her.\n\n6. **Emotional Impact**: The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of dealing with it was harsh. Yelling and leaving could be seen as inconsiderate. Jill's feeling of being yelled at and left alone is valid; it's not just about being late but the emotional hurt.\n\n7. **Context of the Relationship**: They're engaged, so the expectation is to support each other. The author's action might have been a momentary reaction, but in a committed relationship, communication and support are crucial. Leaving her could damage trust or make her feel unsupported.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while Jill's time management is part of the problem, the author's response\u2014raising his voice and leaving her\u2014might be seen as crossing a line. The action of leaving her at home could be viewed as the author being in the wrong because it's a harsh reaction that prioritizes punctuality over her well-being and the relationship. The immediate consequence was her missing the event or arriving late, and the emotional harm done might outweigh the reason for punctuality. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
