Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation revolves around time management and communication issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author (let's call him Will) mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting her time. They often end up late, and he finds it rude to be late. They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away starting at 4:30 PM. Will told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were still damp, and she wasn't ready. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00, and left without her. Now Jill is upset, saying he was impatient, lied about the clothes drying, and was mean. Will thinks she's defensive because she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom Will's perspective: He communicated the need to leave by 3:45 PM. He gave a clear deadline, and Jill didn't meet it. He got frustrated and left, which he acknowledges was a wrongdoing (raising his voice). But he wanted to avoid being late to the wedding. He might feel that Jill's lack of time management is the issue here.\n\nFrom Jill's perspective: She might feel disrespected that Will left her despite knowing the situation. She might have thought she had enough time, maybe the laundry situation was an issue. She could be upset about being yelled at and left alone, which is a significant action. Also, Will told her the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp, which she might see as a broken promise.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. Will gave a clear deadline, and Jill didn't meet it. However, leaving her alone might be seen as an extreme reaction. Even if he was frustrated, taking off without her could be seen as abandonment in a moment of stress. Also, he did raise his voice, which is unkind. While Jill's time management is a problem, the way he handled it might have been inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle: Weddings are important events, and being on time is a courtesy. But in a relationship, partners also need to support each other through these issues. Maybe Will could have handled the frustration differently, like giving her more encouragement or helping her get ready faster instead of leaving. His actions, even if motivated by wanting to be punctual, might be seen as inconsiderate to Jill's feelings in the moment.\n\nHowever, Jill is also responsible for her own time management. She was given a clear deadline and didn't meet it. She might have known from their past experiences that Will is particular about punctuality. So she might have underestimated the time needed, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a two-way street. Will's actions (yelling, leaving) were unkind and hurtful, which is his fault. Jill's poor time management and not meeting the deadline is her issue. But the question is whether the author (Will) is in the wrong. Since he left her alone and yelled, those actions are definitely his wrongdoing. So while both have faults, the question is about the author's responsibility. The answer would likely lean towards A (Yes, he is in the wrong) because his actions were the direct cause of the problem, even if Jill contributed.\n"
