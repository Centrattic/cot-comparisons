Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me think through this. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. He values punctuality and finds it rude to be late. They had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM to make the 4:30 PM wedding start. He gave her a heads-up, but she said she'd be fine. However, at 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were damp, and he left at 4:00, which made him arrive late. Jill is upset because he raised his voice, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and left her.\n\nThe key points here are communication, expectations, and the action of leaving. The author did warn her about the time, but maybe he didn't follow up enough. He raised his voice, which is a sign of losing his temper, which isn't helpful. He left her alone, which could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready). Even though he wanted to be punctual, his actions might have been harsh. On the other hand, Jill might be at fault for not managing her time, but the author's response could have been better. \n\nLeaving her at home might have been a mistake because it's not just about being on time but also about supporting each other. The author's frustration is understandable, but yelling and leaving could have been avoidable. Maybe he should have tried to help her get ready instead of leaving. Also, he assumed the clothes would be dry, but if they were only slightly damp, maybe that was a problem too. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did make a mistake by raising his voice and leaving her, even if the situation was frustrating. Therefore, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong. But I need to make sure. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The story is a bit of a classic case where both parties have some responsibility, but the action of leaving her might cross a line. Since he left her in a state where she couldn't go, that's a problem. So yeah, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
