Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given AITA story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest, but she wasn't ready by then. He got upset, raised his voice, and left her at home, telling her he'd meet her there. She's upset because he was impatient, made a mistake about the clothes, and was mean. The author feels she's being defensive because she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are time management, communication, and the reaction. The author had given a heads up about the departure time, but Jill assured she'd be ready. However, the author didn't back that up with checks or support. Raising their voice and leaving alone might be seen as impatience and a lack of support. \n\nOn one hand, being on time is important, especially at a wedding, which is a significant event. The author might have felt that leaving without Jill was necessary to avoid being late. But on the other hand, leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home could be considered inconsiderate or even a breach of a shared commitment. The fact that Jill was still naked and her clothes were slightly damp suggests she was in the middle of getting ready, which might not be her fault entirely. Maybe the laundry time wasn't enough? The author had said \"probably\" the clothes would be dry, but Jill might have relied on that and then they weren't.\n\nThe author raised their voice, which is a valid criticism. Yelling is disrespectful and can be hurtful. Even if frustrated, it's important to communicate calmly. Also, leaving without her might have caused her additional stress and embarrassment. Weddings are social events where both partners are expected to attend together, so leaving her alone could be seen as abandoning her during a stressful time.\n\nBut the author might argue that Jill didn't take responsibility and that they had discussed this issue before. The tension here is between holding each other accountable and being supportive. Maybe the author could have handled the situation better, like staying to help her get ready or making a compromise, instead of just leaving. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were justified. While punctuality is important, the method of dealing with the issue (yelling and leaving) seems harsh. The author might be in the wrong for not being more understanding and for not following through on their own advice about not being late. They could have checked on the laundry time more accurately or given her more time if they had the option, instead of reacting impulsively.\n"
