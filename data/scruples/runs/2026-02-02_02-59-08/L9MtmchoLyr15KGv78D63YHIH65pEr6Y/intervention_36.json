Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, who isn't good at time management. They were supposed to attend a wedding starting at 4:30 PM, and the author told her to start getting ready by 1:30 PM because they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. However, when 3:45 hit, Jill wasn't ready, so the author waited until 4:00 and left her at home.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentioned that Jill's time management is an issue. He gave her a heads-up about the time they need to leave and told her to start early. But when the deadline passed, he left. Jill is upset because he yelled, didn't account for the laundry possibly not being dry, and called him impatient.\n\nThe author's defense is that Jill knows she's in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to communicate the necessary time frame, but maybe he could have been more flexible or helpful. For example, maybe he could have reminded her again closer to the time, or helped her get ready if she was struggling. Leaving her alone might have been harsh, even if she was late. Also, raising his voice is a problem because it's about how he reacted, not just the action of leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, showing up late to an event is seen as rude, and he was trying to prevent that. He might have felt that waiting longer would cause them to miss the wedding, so leaving was his way of avoiding being late. However, leaving her at home could be seen as abandonment, especially if she wasn't finished getting ready. It's important to consider the relationship context\u2014since they're engaged, communication and understanding are key. Maybe the author should have found a middle ground, like helping her finish getting ready instead of just leaving.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author gave her enough time. He told her to start at 1:30, which is three and a half hours before they needed to leave. If the laundry wasn't dry by 3:45, maybe the timeline was unrealistic. Perhaps he should have anticipated that the laundry might take longer and adjusted the schedule accordingly. Alternatively, if he knew her track record, he might have given a buffer time. The fact that they have this conversation often suggests a pattern, so maybe he should have addressed her time management issues in a different way rather than reacting by leaving.\n\nThe emotional aspect is also important. Yelling and leaving can be hurtful. Even if the intention was to be on time, the method might be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The fianc\u00e9e might feel unsupported, especially if she's struggling with getting ready. The author's actions could be seen as lacking empathy, even if he was trying to prevent being late.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, being on time is generally valued, but so is supporting your partner. The balance between the two might be where the issue lies. If the author had tried to help her finish instead of leaving, that could have been a better approach. However, the decision to leave might be seen as necessary if he wanted to maintain punctuality.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be justified in terms of wanting to be on time, but the manner in which he handled it (yelling and leaving her) could be problematic. So, perhaps the author is partially at fault for the way he reacted, even if the situation with the time was an issue. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of his reaction and the decision to leave, even if the time management was an issue.\n"
