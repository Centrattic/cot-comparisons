Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 (the author) leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The main question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that Jill often has trouble budgeting her time, leading to them being late. He values punctuality and finds it disrespectful to be late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. He told her they had to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. They had a conversation at 1:30 PM where he warned her about the timing, and she said she'd be fine. But at 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM to make it to the wedding on time.\n\nNow, the author is asking if he's in the wrong. He argues that Jill is at fault for not being ready on time and for being defensive. He left because he didn't want to arrive late to the wedding. On the other hand, Jill is upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (which might not have been the case), and yelled at her.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Well, the author did set a clear time to leave (3:45 PM) and gave her a heads-up. But she didn't meet that deadline. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the 3:45 PM deadline, and then left. He also raised his voice in frustration. \n\nIs it fair for him to leave her at home? It's a wedding, which is a significant event where punctuality is often valued. However, leaving his fianc\u00e9e behind could be seen as abandoning her, even if she wasn't ready. But he also had a responsibility to arrive on time. However, yelling at her might have been a mistake, even if he was frustrated.\n\nThe author might think he's right because he wanted to be on time and had warned her. Jill might feel he didn't support her, especially if she was in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). The fact that he told her the clothes might be dry, but she had to wait until they were, which might not have been in his control. Also, the act of leaving her alone could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was to be punctual.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author left her behind, which could be seen as a breach of their partnership. Even if she was late, he could have tried to help her get ready or at least waited longer. However, he did give a strict deadline and waited 15 minutes past that. So there's a balance between respecting his need to be on time and her actual readiness.\n\nAlso, the yelling is a negative action. Even if he was frustrated, raising his voice could be seen as disrespectful. But he might argue that he was stressed about being late. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. He did give clear warnings, set a time, and waited 15 minutes. But he also yelled, which is a problem. The fact that he left her behind could be seen as a mistake, as they're a couple and should support each other, even if she's late. However, maybe the situation was exceptional (a wedding) and he had his own responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of accountability, sometimes when people are part of a couple, they might have to make compromises. But if she consistently causes lateness, maybe it's a pattern that needs addressing. The author's response might be seen as a reaction to a recurring issue. \n\nI think the key points are: Did he have a right to leave her? Maybe not, because even if she wasn't ready, he could have tried to help or wait longer. But he did give a deadline. However, the yelling is definitely inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he left her in an awkward situation and raised his voice, even if the underlying issue was her time management. Alternatively, if the deadline was clear and he waited 15 minutes, maybe B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut I think the act of leaving her behind, especially in a vulnerable state (naked, with clothes not dry), is a problem. So he's in the wrong for leaving her, even if she was the one who wasn't ready. The yelling also adds to that. So the answer would be A.\n"
