Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because they were going to be late.\n\nFirst, the setup: The couple often has issues with time management, especially Jill. The author, let's call him Will, planned to leave at 3:45 PM to get to the wedding by 4:30 PM. He warned Jill earlier that they needed to leave by 3:45. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. Will got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled at her.\n\nThe key points here are the communication, the actions taken, and the consequences. Will tried to set a deadline and gave a heads up. However, he might have assumed the laundry would dry in time without confirming. When Jill didn't meet the deadline, he reacted by leaving, which caused her to miss the wedding part. \n\nOn one hand, Will wanted to be punctual, which is respectful to the event and others. On the other hand, he didn't account for the laundry's actual dry time, didn't check in further after the initial warning, and escalated by yelling, which is unkind. Leaving her alone might have been an overreaction, especially since she wasn't ready yet but maybe could have finished quickly if given more time. \n\nJill's responsibility is also part of the equation. She agreed to the deadline, so if she couldn't meet it, she should take some responsibility. However, Will's approach\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. A better approach might have been to try to help her finish faster or adjust the plan instead of abandoning her. \n\nConsidering both sides, while Jill shares some fault for not being ready on time, Will's actions in raising his voice and leaving could be seen as the wrong move. The question is whether his actions were justified given the situation. Since he left her alone instead of working with her to solve the problem, it's possible he's in the wrong. So the answer might be A.\n"
