Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is presented as an AITA (Am I The Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author, let's call him Will, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. They discussed leaving by 3:45 to be on time. Will mentioned the laundry and gave Jill a heads up about the time. She said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she's not ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and he gets upset. He raises his voice and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there. She's upset because he was impatient, made a comment about the clothes, and yelled.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The main question is whether Will's actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, Will was trying to be punctual and respectful of others' time. He had given multiple reminders and set a clear deadline. If he shows up late to a wedding, that could be seen as rude. He might be frustrated with a recurring issue (Jill's time management). \n\nOn the other hand, leaving her alone might be harsh. She was still getting ready, and even if she was unprepared, abandoning her could be hurtful. Raising his voice was definitely a mistake. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, yelling and leaving might be an overreaction. The fact that the clothes were slightly damp\u2014he initially said they might be dry, so maybe he's contradicting himself. That could add to her feeling like he's being inconsistent or blaming her.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and proportionality. Will gave warnings, but maybe he should have been more understanding or helped Jill get ready instead of leaving. Leaving her behind might have been a last-ditch effort to be on time, but it's a significant action that could strain their relationship. The yelling is definitely a negative point. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for actions that are seen as selfish or not giving enough empathy, even if the other person is at fault. So while Jill might be responsible for not being ready, Will's response of yelling and leaving could be seen as the asshole move. He could have waited a bit longer, communicated better, or taken steps to help her get ready instead of leaving her alone. \n\nI think the answer here is that Will is in the wrong. He handled the situation poorly by raising his voice and abandoning her. Even if she's not ready, his method of dealing with it was unkind and hurtful. The fact that they're engaged and this is a recurring issue suggests that maybe they need to find a better solution together rather than Will taking unilateral action.\n"
