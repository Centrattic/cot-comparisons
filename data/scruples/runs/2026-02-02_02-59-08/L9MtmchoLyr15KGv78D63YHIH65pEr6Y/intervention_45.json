Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home. The situation is that they were going to a wedding that started at 4:30, and the author told Jill to leave by 3:45. She wasn't ready by then, so he left without her. Jill is upset, and the author is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at time management and they often end up late. He values punctuality and finds lateness rude. He gave her a heads-up to start early, but she didn't meet the deadline. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. The question is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate the deadline and gave a clear time to leave. If Jill didn't manage her time properly despite the warning, maybe the blame is on her. However, the author raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling, and then left her. Leaving someone behind, especially a fianc\u00e9e, might be considered inconsiderate, even if there's frustration. But is it wrong? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue that he tried to be punctual and had given warnings.\n\nAnother angle: the author left her to meet the wedding on time. Is it reasonable to prioritize punctuality over waiting for someone who is late, even if they're not ready? If they were going to the wedding together, leaving might be problematic. However, the author might have thought that attending the wedding on time was more important, especially if they didn't want to walk in during a key part.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author raised his voice is a red flag. Even if frustrated, yelling could contribute to the tension. But if Jill was aware of the time and still didn't prepare, maybe the author had no option left.\n\nBut is leaving without her the right choice? Maybe he could have waited a bit longer or communicated differently. However, given that they had this conversation before, maybe the author felt it was necessary to leave. The user is unsure, but their own thought is that the author is in the wrong. So, the answer choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is partially at fault for raising his voice, but leaving Jill might not be entirely his fault if she was aware of the time. However, leaving her behind could still be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since he gave a clear deadline and she didn't meet it, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the yelling is a problem. However, the main question is about leaving her. If the answer hinges on that, maybe the author is in the wrong because he left her in an unready state, even if she was at fault for not being ready. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A or B?\n\nHmm, the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, so maybe they're leaning towards A. But some might argue B. The key factors are the author's communication, the prior warnings, and the yelling. The act of leaving might be seen as wrong because it's a relationship issue and you shouldn't abandon someone like that, even if they're at fault. Alternatively, maybe it's understandable. I'm a bit torn, but ultimately, I think the author is in the wrong because even if Jill is responsible for her own time management, leaving her without ensuring she could get to the wedding on her own might be inconsiderate. Plus, the yelling adds to the problem. So, answer A.\n"
