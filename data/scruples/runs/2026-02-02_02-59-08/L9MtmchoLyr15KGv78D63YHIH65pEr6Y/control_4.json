Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author (let's call him Will) and his fianc\u00e9e Jill are going to a wedding that starts at 4:30 PM. Will mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often get stressed when they're running late. Will sees punctuality as a sign of respect. \n\nThe timeline: At 1:30 PM, Will checks in with Jill about doing laundry. He tells her they need to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. Jill says she's okay with the timeline. Then, by 3:45, Jill is still not ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. Will gets frustrated, raises his voice, waits until 4:00, and leaves her, saying he can't wait any longer. Jill is upset because she feels he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nNow, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom Will's perspective: He set a clear deadline based on the event start time. He warned Jill multiple times. When she didn't meet the deadline, he tried to leave on time as to not disrupt the event. He was frustrated, which led to raising his voice, but he left her a chance to catch up (waiting until 4:00). He might feel he did the right thing by prioritizing punctuality.\n\nFrom Jill's perspective: She trusted that the laundry would dry in time, as Will had said \"probably\" but left it up to her. She might feel she was given a hard deadline without enough flexibility. Being left alone could be seen as abandonment, and the yelling adds to her frustration. She might feel Will didn't account for the uncertainty in the laundry time and was too rigid.\n\nKey factors: Communication, responsibility, and empathy. Will set a deadline based on the event timing, which is reasonable. But he might have underestimated the drying time, given the history. When he realized the problem, his reaction (yelling) was unhelpful. However, he did wait until 4:00, giving her some buffer. He left to prevent being late, which some might see as responsible, but others might argue that leaving her behind caused more harm.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Will's approach of setting a strict deadline might be necessary, but perhaps he should have checked in more during the process. Jill's time management issues are a recurring problem, so maybe Will should address it with more support rather than strict deadlines. However, the immediate situation was about a specific event. \n\nThe act of leaving her might be seen as harsh, especially if it's not something they've discussed beforehand. But Will did wait until 4:00, which shows he tried to be patient. The yelling complicates things because it's a form of emotional harm. \n\nIn terms of social norms, leaving someone behind at an event might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it's a wedding where being present is important. However, the alternative is being late, which Will views as disrespectful. \n\nBalancing both perspectives, Will's actions were driven by a desire to be punctual, but the method (yelling and leaving) could be problematic. He might be in the right in wanting to be on time but in the wrong in his handling of the situation. The key issue here is whether the means justified the ends. Since he left her there, which could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, needing to get dressed), that might tip the scales towards him being in the wrong. However, the fact that he gave her a heads-up and a deadline could mitigate some responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Will is in the wrong) because he left her in a problematic state and raised his voice, which is disrespectful. However, some might argue that he was justified in wanting to be on time. It's a close call, but the immediate action of leaving her might be seen as the wrong choice, especially given the outcome.\n"
