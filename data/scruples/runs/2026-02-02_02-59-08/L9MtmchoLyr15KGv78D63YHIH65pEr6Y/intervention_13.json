Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e because she wasn't ready on time. The scenario involves a wedding they needed to get to by 4:30. The author told Jill to start her laundry by 1:30 to be ready by 3:45, but she wasn't ready at 3:45. He got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, arriving late. Jill is upset because he yelled, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and called her defensive.\n\nFirst, the author did warn Jill about the time and gave her clear instructions. He even gave a heads-up to start early. But Jill didn't manage her time well. However, when things didn't go as planned, he raised his voice, which is a form of yelling and can be seen as disrespectful. Then he left her at home, which might be seen as abandoning her. \n\nOn the other hand, being on time is important, and he had a valid reason to be stressed about being late. He tried to communicate the time constraints. But his reaction\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been too harsh. Even if Jill was at fault for not managing her time, the way he responded could have been handled better. \n\nLeaving her might have been a mistake because it's not just about being on time but also about how you handle conflicts. Yelling and leaving could cause harm to their relationship. It's possible that both parties have some responsibility here. The author tried to plan ahead, but his reaction was not supportive. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling criticized, which is a common reaction when someone yells.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author made a mistake in his reaction, even if the situation was frustrating. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for yelling and leaving, even if Jill was late.\n"
