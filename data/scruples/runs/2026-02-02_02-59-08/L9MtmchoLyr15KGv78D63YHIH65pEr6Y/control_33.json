Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, let's call him Will for simplicity, is asking if he was in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The key points here are their conversation, the timeline, and their arguments.\n\nFirst, the background: Jill isn't good at budgeting time, which leads to delays. They had a conversation at 1:30 PM. Will mentions that they need to leave by 3:45 PM to make the 4:30 wedding on time. He also tells Jill to start her laundry if she needs two hours. She says she'll be fine. Then, by 3:45 PM, she's not ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's still naked. Will gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM, saying he can't wait any longer.\n\nJill's side: She's upset that Will was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (even though he said it was up to her), and yelled at her. She feels he's in the wrong. Will, on the other hand, thinks she's in the wrong because of her time management and being defensive.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. Will gave a heads-up about the 3:45 deadline and asked if she needed to start laundry early. He gave her time to manage her tasks. She assured him she was fine. When she didn't meet the deadline, he left. He did raise his voice in frustration, which is a problem because yelling is not okay. However, the situation is that she was unprepared despite prior warnings.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he did leave her alone, which could be seen as abandoning her. Weddings are important events, and leaving your fianc\u00e9e at home might cause her distress. Also, he told her the clothes would be dry, but he actually said it was up to her. That might have led to confusion. So, he might have set up some expectations that weren't clear.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time as agreed. She was aware of the deadline and didn't meet it. Will's frustration is understandable, but his response (yelling and leaving) is problematic. However, leaving might have been a way to avoid being late, which he values as punctuality.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer isn't black and white. He did act out of frustration, which isn't acceptable. But he also followed the deadline he set. However, leaving her alone could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she was unprepared despite knowing the time constraints. The fact that he left her might not be the best approach, but maybe he was trying to uphold the agreed-upon time. The community might see both sides, but since he raised his voice and left her, he might be partially at fault. However, if Jill consistently has time management issues, maybe Will is trying to enforce a boundary. But the act of leaving her alone could be seen as not standing by her during a stressful time. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he left her, which is a harsh action, and yelling. But some might argue that he's not wrong because he followed the timeline he set. The community often looks at communication and intent. Since he left her, even if frustrated, it might be considered wrong.\n"
