Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, some context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They often end up late or the author gets stressed when they're running behind. The wedding is 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The conversation starts at 1:30 PM when the author mentions doing laundry and warns Jill to start getting ready because they need to leave by 3:45 PM. Jill says she'll be fine. Then at 3:45, she's not ready, still in the nude, clothes slightly damp. The author gets upset, raises his voice, waits until 4:00, then leaves her to meet there. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't make sure the laundry was dry, and yelled. The author thinks she's being defensive and knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author gave a clear deadline (3:45) and a heads up to start early if it takes two hours. Jill said she could manage, but didn't. The author waited past the deadline, but when she wasn't ready, left. The question is whether he's wrong for leaving her.\n\nOn one hand, the author had set a reasonable time to leave, and given prior warnings. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the latest possible departure time. He got frustrated and raised his voice, which is a problem. Leaving her at home might have been a harsh reaction, but maybe he felt it was to avoid being late. On the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time as agreed and is now upset about the consequences. The author's yelling is definitely inconsiderate and could be a red flag for how conflicts are handled. However, leaving her might have been to prioritize punctuality, which he values, but it could also be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready).\n\nPossible angles: The author's responsibility to communicate effectively, his response to stress (yelling), and the decision to leave. Jill's responsibility to manage time and meet agreed-upon deadlines. Was leaving the only option? Could he have waited a bit longer or helped her get ready? But the event was important, and they didn't want to miss the ceremony. However, the method of handling it could be questioned. Yelling and then leaving might not be the best approach. Also, leaving her alone might not be safe or considerate if she's still in the house.\n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe both are at fault. The author didn't follow through on helping or being patient after the initial frustration, while Jill didn't take the warnings seriously. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he left her, which could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was at fault, it's possible he's also wrong for not being more supportive. However, if the deadline was non-negotiable, maybe he had to leave. It's a bit of a gray area, but the act of leaving might be seen as inconsiderate, especially considering she was in a vulnerable state. The yelling also adds to his fault.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of his raised voice and decision to leave her unprepared, even if she was responsible for time management. However, some might argue that he had a valid reason to avoid being late. But the method of handling it is questionable.\n"
