Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The scenario is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had agreed to leave by 3:45 to get to a 4:30 wedding. Jill didn't start getting ready on time, and when the time came, she wasn't ready, so the author left her at home. He raised his voice in frustration but didn't go into the event without her. Instead, he said he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset, thinking he's being impatient and mean. The author thinks she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are time management issues, communication, and the decision to leave. The author tried to set a clear time (3:45) and reminded Jill multiple times. Jill, on the other hand, didn't adhere to that, leading to the conflict. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider elements of responsibility. Both parties have roles. The author set a time and expected her to follow through, but maybe he should have given a more gradual reminder or waited a bit longer. However, he did wait until 4:00 before leaving, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time. \n\nAlso, the author raised his voice, which is a point against him. But he left her a way to meet him later. Jill's frustration is about being left, but she also didn't manage her time. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate the time, but maybe didn't follow up enough. Jill might not have communicated her progress. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he left her, but perhaps he felt it was necessary to avoid being late. However, leaving a fianc\u00e9e behind might be seen as harsh, even if she's at fault. The question is whether the action of leaving her (not attending the event with her) is wrong. \n\nBut in the scenario, he didn't abandon her entirely; he said he'd meet her there. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he made an effort to communicate the time, and she didn't follow through. However, raising his voice is a negative point. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is considered not at fault if the other party is clearly in the wrong. Jill's time management is an issue. The author tried to set boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because Jill didn't adhere to the agreed time, and he had to make a choice to leave to not be late. However, he could have handled the situation better without raising his voice. But the act of leaving her to not be late isn't necessarily his fault.\n"
