Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e. The situation is about being late to a wedding because the fianc\u00e9e wasn't ready on time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author, let's call him Will, planned to leave at 3:45 to get to the wedding on time. He reminded Jill earlier to start getting ready in time. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone. Now, she's upset, and he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. So, the task is to determine if the answer is A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, Will left Jill behind because he didn't want to be late. He had given a clear deadline, and when she missed it, he took action. He might feel justified in not wanting to be late and taking responsibility for his own punctuality. On the other hand, leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home alone might be seen as abandoning her, especially if she wasn't prepared. Also, raising his voice in frustration could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut wait, maybe Jill was responsible for her own readiness. Will had given her the heads-up earlier. If she knew the timeline but still wasn't ready, maybe the problem lies more with her time management. However, leaving her at home could be seen as not considering her needs or safety. Also, the fact that she was still naked and her clothes were only slightly damp might mean she couldn't just put them on immediately. \n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, communication is key. Will got frustrated and left without ensuring she was okay. That could be seen as selfish or not being supportive. Even if she was at fault for being late, his response might have been too harsh. \n\nBut then again, being late for a wedding is a social faux pas, and Will might have felt it was important to arrive on time. If he left to avoid being late, maybe he was trying to be respectful to the hosts. However, he could have waited a little longer, maybe given her a few more minutes or helped her in some way instead of just leaving. \n\nThe key here is whether leaving her was the right action. If he left, did he ensure she had a way to get to the wedding herself? Did he consider her feelings or her ability to manage the situation alone? The story doesn't mention if Jill could go alone, but since they were going together, leaving her might cause her to be embarrassed or have to go alone at the last minute. \n\nAlso, the fact that he raised his voice adds to the conflict. Even if she was late, yelling isn't helpful. So, his actions might have contributed to the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is A. He's in the wrong because he left her and yelled, even if she was responsible for being late. In a relationship, supporting each other is important, and his response was perhaps too harsh. However, there's a counter-argument that he tried to be responsible about time. But the act of leaving her behind is where the issue lies. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is correct because he tried to manage the time and she was at fault. But leaving her alone might not be the best approach. I think the consensus here would be that he's in the wrong because he left her without a plan, yelled, and didn't support her despite the situation. So the answer is A.\n"
