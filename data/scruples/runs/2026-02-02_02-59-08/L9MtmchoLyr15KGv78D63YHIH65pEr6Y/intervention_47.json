Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. The situation is a common one where time management is an issue.\n\nFirst, the author set a strict departure time at 3:45, which they mentioned earlier. Jill said she'd be ready, but she wasn't. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset about being left behind.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's frustration might be understandable, especially if this is a recurring issue. Being on time is important, and they might feel that they can't control Jill's actions. However, leaving her at home without trying to resolve the situation immediately seems harsh. \n\nThe author did give a heads-up about the time, so Jill had the chance to prepare. But when the time came, instead of trying to help or communicate better, the author just left. Maybe there was a lack of understanding and support here. Also, yelling adds to the emotional impact, which is not helpful.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that she was left behind and the author didn't support her when she was already stressed. The author might be trying to be responsible, but the way they handled it could be seen as selfish, especially in a relationship. Both need to work on communication and maybe find a middle ground instead of taking such actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong. Even if Jill was unprepared, the way the author reacted wasn't constructive. They should have tried to help her get ready or at least gone together to the event, perhaps arriving late but supporting each other. Leaving her alone in that state isn't a good solution. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
