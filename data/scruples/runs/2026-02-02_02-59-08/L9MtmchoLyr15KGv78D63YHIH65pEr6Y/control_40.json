Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because she wasn't ready on time.\n\nFirst, the context: They were supposed to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, had been given a heads up to start getting ready early because she's not good with time. The author warned her multiple times, and she said she'd be fine. When the time came, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left alone.\n\nNow, breaking it down. The author's reasons: they value punctuality, don't want to be late for the wedding, and have given multiple warnings. They tried to be helpful with the laundry and set a clear time to leave. When Jill didn't meet the deadline, they left. They think Jill is being defensive.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels the author was impatient, made a promise about the laundry that wasn't kept (the clothes were slightly damp), and yelled at her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, did they handle it well? Raising their voice in frustration is definitely a negative point. Even if they were stressed, yelling is disrespectful and could hurt feelings. Also, they left her at home, which might be seen as abandoning her, even if the intention was to make it to the wedding on time. However, Jill did know the time and didn't get ready, which is her responsibility. The author tried to communicate clearly but maybe could have handled the situation better without yelling and maybe waited a bit more, or they could have discussed the issue of time management beforehand.\n\nBut the act of leaving might be seen as a last resort. However, the yelling and the way they left could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong for the yelling and leaving her behind, even if Jill was at fault for not being ready. It's a mix of both, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the raised voice and the decision to leave without a backup plan. Maybe they should have found another solution, like staying a little longer but not yelling, or arranging a ride for her if they had to leave. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because of the yelling and the abrupt departure, even if the original problem was Jill's time management.\n"
