Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home after they missed a wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wedding starts at 4:30. They live 30 minutes away, so they should leave by 3:45 at the latest. The fianc\u00e9 told Jill to start her laundry early enough for it to be dry. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are only slightly dry. He gets frustrated, yells, waits until 4:00, then leaves alone.\n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean. The author thinks she's in the wrong because she knew her time management issues but still didn't prepare properly.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The fianc\u00e9 planned ahead, set a clear deadline, and tried to communicate. He even gave a heads up about the time. Jill, on the other hand, has a history of time management problems but assured she'd be ready. She didn't account for possible delays in laundry. The fianc\u00e9 got frustrated and raised his voice, which is a problem. However, leaving to arrive on time might be his way of respecting commitments.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He did leave without her, which might be seen as abandoning her. But he also had a valid reason to be on time. The yelling is a fault, but the main issue is the decision to leave. Some might argue that he should've waited, while others might say she's responsible for her actions. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9 took action to avoid being late, but his method might have been harsh. So, maybe he's partially in the wrong for leaving and yelling, but Jill's time management is her responsibility. However, walking out entirely could be seen as neglecting her. It's a bit of a gray area, but since he left her behind intentionally, that's a mistake. So, perhaps answer A (Yes).\n"
