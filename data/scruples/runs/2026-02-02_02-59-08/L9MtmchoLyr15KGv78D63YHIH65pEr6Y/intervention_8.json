Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wedding starts at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away. The author, let's call him Will, told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 PM. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were still damp from the dryer, and she was naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding without her.\n\nHe argues that Jill is at fault for not being ready, as this is a recurring issue. Jill is upset because Will yelled, said the clothes would be dry, and was \"impatient.\" The author thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn Will's side: He was planning to leave on time to be respectful to the wedding guests. He had given a heads-up about the time, so he was trying to manage expectations. When Jill wasn't ready, he felt frustrated and left to avoid being late. He might argue that he had to prioritize punctuality, which is important in social settings.\n\nOn Jill's side: She might feel that Will was impatient and didn't support her. The fact that her clothes were slightly damp and she was still getting ready could be due to the dryer not finishing. If Will had said the clothes would be dry, but they weren't, that could be a point of contention. Also, raising his voice and leaving her alone might feel dismissive or disrespectful, especially if she was struggling with something they often face together.\n\nNow, looking at the key points from the story. The author mentions they have this conversation often, indicating that time management is a recurring issue. Jill might not be good at budgeting time, which causes delays. The author tried to remind her earlier, but she insisted she'd be fine. Then, when the time came, she wasn't ready. \n\nThe author left her at home, which could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable moment (naked, clothes not dry). Even if she's at fault for not being ready, making her go to the wedding alone while she's in that state might be harsh. Also, yelling at her adds another layer of conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication and support are crucial. While being on time is important, the way the author handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might have been overly harsh. The author could have tried to help her get ready instead of just leaving. Maybe he could have offered to adjust their schedule a bit if there was a way, but he chose to prioritize punctuality over her comfort and feelings in that moment.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that he told the clothes would be dry might be a miscommunication. If he said they would probably be dry but it was up to her, and she assumed they would be, then there's a gap in their communication. However, if he gave a false assurance that they would be dry, that's another issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions\u2014leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home in a vulnerable state, raising his voice, and not helping her\u2014could be seen as wrong. Even if Jill is responsible for her time management, the way he handled the situation escalated the problem. He didn't support her during a stressful moment, which could harm their relationship. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
