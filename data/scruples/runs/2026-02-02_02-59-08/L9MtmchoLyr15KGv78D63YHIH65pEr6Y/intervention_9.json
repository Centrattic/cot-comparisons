Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because she wasn't ready on time. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had a conversation early about the wedding starting at 4:30, and the author told her they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were only slightly dry. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 to get to the wedding on time. Now, Jill is upset, saying the author is impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to set clear expectations and gave warnings. They were concerned about punctuality, which is a valid concern. However, the author raised their voice, which can be seen as yelling, which is unkind. Leaving before the fianc\u00e9e without ensuring her well-being might also be seen as abandonment, even if it was to be on time.\n\nBut then, the fianc\u00e9e kept the author waiting, which led to the frustration. The author might feel that after multiple instances of this behavior, they had no choice. However, the act of leaving someone at home for a social event could be seen as breaking a commitment, especially in a marriage context. \n\nAlso, the author's justification for leaving is to avoid being late, but in doing so, they left the fianc\u00e9e behind. That might be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, while possibly defensive, is understandable as she might feel humiliated. The author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by staying longer, helping her get ready, or finding another solution instead of leaving abruptly.\n\nMoreover, the author's assumption that Jill knew her clothes would dry and that she had two hours might have been a mistake. If the laundry wasn't done, that's a problem on Jill's part, but the author's responsibility in setting up the laundry process might also be a factor. Did the author ensure that the laundry was set to dry in time? The post says the author asked Jill if she needed anything in the laundry, and she added her wedding clothes. The author said \"probably dry by then, up to you.\" So maybe the author didn't take responsibility for ensuring that, but Jill might have expected it.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author raised their voice, which escalated the situation. Even if frustrated, yelling is not acceptable. The act of leaving without a better plan could be seen as selfish. However, the author's intention was to honor the commitment to the wedding guests, which is also valid.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author made an effort to plan and set expectations, but in the moment, their response was reactive and hurtful. Leaving the fianc\u00e9e might be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a relationship where mutual support is key. The fianc\u00e9e's lack of time management is a recurring issue, but the author's solution (leaving) may not be the right one. The author should have found a way to address the situation without abandoning their partner. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they reacted in a way that was harsh and left the fianc\u00e9e in an awkward position, even if their intention was to be punctual.\n"
