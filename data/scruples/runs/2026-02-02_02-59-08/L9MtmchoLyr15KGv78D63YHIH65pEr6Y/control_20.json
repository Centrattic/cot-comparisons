Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home to get to a wedding on time. The situation involves Jill, who's not good at time management, and the author who gets stressed when they're running late.\n\nFirst, the wedding starts at 4:30 PM, and the author told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The author reminded her earlier to start getting ready, but she didn't. At 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are damp, and he gets frustrated. He yells a bit and leaves at 4:00 to avoid being late. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, defensive because she thinks she's in the wrong.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's trying to be punctual and respectful, while Jill is the one who didn't manage her time. But by leaving her, he's not helping her. Even if she's at fault for being late, making her go alone might not be the solution. Maybe he should have stayed and helped her get ready instead of leaving. Also, raising his voice adds to the issue, as it's a communication problem. The event is important, so he wants to be on time, but abandoning her could damage their relationship. \n\nSo, while Jill's behavior is a problem, the author's response of leaving her might be hasty. The right thing would be to address the time management issue without leaving her behind. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for not handling it better, even if Jill is also responsible for her part.\n"
