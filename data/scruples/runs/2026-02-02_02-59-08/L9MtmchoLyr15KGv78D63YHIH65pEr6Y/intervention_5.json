Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The key points are the history of time management issues, the specific incident where the author left, and their justifications.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, leading to frequent lateness. They had a prior conversation where the author set a 3:45 PM deadline. When Jill wasn't ready by then, the author left. The author admits to raising their voice in frustration. \n\nNow, considering the situation, the author made a choice to leave without Jill, which is the core issue. While being late is a valid concern, especially as it's a social event where punctuality is valued, the method of handling it matters. The author's frustration led to yelling, which is unproductive and could be seen as harsh. However, the act of leaving Jill alone, even if justified by the time constraint, might be seen as abandoning her, which is a significant issue. \n\nJill's responsibility in not being ready on time is clear, but the author's response of leaving could be seen as not supporting her. In a relationship, communication is key. The author could have tried to talk through the situation, given her time to get ready, or found another solution instead of leaving. Leaving might have been an overreaction, even if the author felt justified. \n\nAdditionally, the author's actions could have consequences for Jill, such as her having to deal with the stress of getting ready alone and getting to the event without support. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while Jill is at fault for not managing her time, the author's decision to leave and the raised voice contribute to the problem. The author could have handled the situation better, making them partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
