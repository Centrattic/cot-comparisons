Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away. The author told his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. She said she'd be ready, but at 3:45, she wasn't, clothes were slightly damp. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, saying he'd meet her there. She's upset because he was impatient, didn't confirm the laundry would dry in time, and was mean.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He set a clear time (3:45) based on the 30-minute drive. He communicated the need to leave early to avoid being late, which he values as respectful. He gave previous warnings. When Jill didn't meet the deadline, he left to avoid being late to the event. He might feel he's justified because she knew the time and didn't prepare accordingly.\n\nOn Jill's side: She might feel he didn't account for possible delays, like laundry not drying. The author told her the clothes \"probably\" would be dry, which is vague. She could argue that his frustration and yelling were uncalled for, especially since the issue was her time management. Also, leaving her home alone might be seen as abandoning her, even if she was being irresponsible.\n\nPossible factors: The author raised his voice, which is a valid point against him. Yelling is generally seen as disrespectful. Also, not confirming whether the laundry would dry in time could be seen as his oversight. However, Jill had a history of time management issues and was given clear deadlines. The author tried to plan ahead but failed to follow up.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. He did set clear expectations, but his reaction (yelling and leaving) might be too harsh. Jill's responsibility for her time management is on her, but the author's response could have been handled better. However, some might argue that he's trying to uphold punctuality, which is reasonable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person is seen as not entirely wrong if they tried to communicate and plan, even if their reaction was harsh. However, the act of leaving her alone could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if she was unprepared. The yelling is definitely a negative point. The fact that he \"did the wrong thing\" by yelling might tip the scales towards him being in the wrong, even if the initial issue was Jill's.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his yelling and leaving her home are problematic responses. Even though Jill was unprepared, his actions could have been more understanding or handled differently. The community might see his reaction as impatience and meanness, which he was accused of. However, others might empathize with his effort to be punctual. But given the details, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
