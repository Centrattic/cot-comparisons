My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a father of two boys, ages 8 and 14, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids and watch them a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, after advice from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son about how the son felt regarding the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house.\n\nThe author is asking if he was wrong to talk to his son about his girlfriend. He feels he needs to be able to talk to his kids without permission. The key points here are the parent's responsibility to their children's well-being and the girlfriend's reaction. \n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's reasonable to check in with their kids about their feelings, especially after external advice suggested that the children's perceptions matter. The author didn't mention badmouthing the girlfriend; he just discussed her and the situation. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe she felt insecure or untrusted. However, the parent has a duty to ensure the kids are okay. \n\nThe issue is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend without the girlfriend's consent is wrong. Since the parent is the legal guardian, discussing the child's feelings and living arrangements is part of their role. Unless there's a history of abuse or manipulation, it's generally okay to talk to your kids about their caregivers. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling like her authority is being questioned, but the parent isn't doing anything wrong by checking in on their child's well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He acted responsibly as a parent. The answer should be B.\n"
