My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author living with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She was upset and called him an asshole. Then, the author had a conversation with his oldest son to check in on how he's feeling about the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. As a parent, the author has a responsibility to check in with his children about their well-being, especially when there are big changes like a parent missing (mother being away) and a new partner in the house. The author's intention was to ensure his son is okay and hasn't been negatively affected by the living situation. That seems like a reasonable parental action.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend felt that the conversation was a criticism of her and that her authority was undermined. The key here is communication. The author didn't consult with the girlfriend before talking to the son. While it's a parent's right to talk to their children, the way it was done might have been without proper communication with the partner, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nBut on the other hand, parents do have the right to discuss family matters with their children, including their perceptions of the adults in their lives. The author's son is 14, so he's old enough to have a conversation about his feelings. The author's concern for the child's well-being is valid. The problem arises from the lack of transparency with the girlfriend. The author didn't mention discussing this with her first, which might have been a mistake, but it's not necessarily wrong if the primary intent was the child's welfare.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left the house and said he has the maturity of a 6-year-old. That's a strong response. However, the author might have been acting out of care for his child. The question is whether the author overstepped by not discussing the conversation with the girlfriend first. But as the parent, he's entitled to assess his child's feelings, even if it includes talking about the partner. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations here, understanding that the parent's primary duty is to the children.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he had discussed the plan to talk to the son with the girlfriend first, that would have been better. But the act of talking to his son about his perceptions, even if it involved the girlfriend, is not inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling undermined, but the author's intent was to check on his child's well-being. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
