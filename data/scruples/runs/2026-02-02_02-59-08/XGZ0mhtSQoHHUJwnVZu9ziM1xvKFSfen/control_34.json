My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about talking to his 14-year-old son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author argues he needed to talk to his kids without prior approval from the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, parents usually have the right to discuss their children's lives, including their relationships. The author wanted to check on his son's well-being, which is a parent's duty. However, the way he approached it might have been an issue. If the conversation included critical views about the girlfriend, that could be problematic. But the author says the conversation was as much about the ex as the girlfriend, implying balance.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings might be valid if she felt disrespected. However, the author is an adult with kids; he should have the autonomy to talk to them. The key is whether the conversation was done in a way that's appropriate. If the son was asked his honest opinion without badmouthing the girlfriend, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the conversation was one-sided or criticized the girlfriend, that's a problem. The author didn't specify the content, but he claims it wasn't undermining. \n\nConsidering all, the author's intent was to check on his son's well-being. Unless he was actively badmouthing the girlfriend, he's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
