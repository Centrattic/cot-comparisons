My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a complex family dynamic where the author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to help pick up the kids, which led to conflict. The author then had a conversation with his son about the girlfriend and their mother, which upset her.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend is wrong. The author's intention was to understand how his children feel about the living arrangement and their mother being away. He mentions it was a wake-up call from previous comments that kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance. So, he wanted to check in with his son, which seems like a reasonable parent action to ensure the kids are okay.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend took it as undermining her. The problem here is communication. The author didn't consult the girlfriend first, which might have been a mistake. But as a parent, the child's well-being is paramount, and talking to them is part of that responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and saying the author is like a 6-year-old. That's a harsh response. \n\nOn the other hand, the author should consider how his actions might affect the relationship with the girlfriend. Maybe there's a way to discuss such things with the girlfriend while still talking to the kids. But the core issue is the parent's right to talk to their children about family matters. The author isn't doing anything malicious; he's concerned about his kids' feelings. The girlfriend's insecurity here might be the bigger issue. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author acted out of parental concern, which is justified, but perhaps didn't communicate with the girlfriend first. However, the girlfriend's overreaction and the fact that the author's action was in the best interest of the children suggest he's not the asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
