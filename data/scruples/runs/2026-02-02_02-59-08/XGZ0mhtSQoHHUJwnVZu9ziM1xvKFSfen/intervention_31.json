My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to their son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The situation involves the author living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which she took as a criticism. Now, the author had a conversation with his son to understand his thoughts on the current living situation and the girlfriend, which the girlfriend found offensive, feeling undermined and mistrusted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should be able to talk to their children about family matters, especially regarding their well-being. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which is a reasonable concern. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense, suggesting that she feels her position in the family is being questioned. The key here is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend in a way that could be seen as critical or undermining. If the conversation was neutral and aimed at understanding the child's perspective, it's not inherently wrong. But if the parent brought up the girlfriend in a context that made the son choose sides or feel like the girlfriend's role is under scrutiny, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author mentions that the conversation included both the mother's absence (since the kids' mom is away) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is about being undermined and feeling untrusted. The parent might not have intended to do so, but the way the question was framed could have made the son feel like he was being used to evaluate the girlfriend's role. Younger children might not grasp the nuances, but the 14-year-old could perceive it as a conflict between the parent and the girlfriend. The parent's responsibility is to manage the household and ensure the kids' emotional health, so talking to them is part of that. However, the method and context of the conversation matter. If the parent approached it as a covert way to assess the girlfriend's suitability, that's an issue. But if it was a genuine effort to check on the child's feelings without bias, it's justified.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's feelings, she might feel that her role in the family isn't being respected, especially if she's already dealing with job loss stress. The parent's timing and approach could have been sensitive. Maybe the parent should have discussed the matter with the girlfriend first to avoid misunderstandings, even though the kids are his responsibility. But the core issue is whether the conversation itself was wrong. The parent isn't obligated to get permission from the girlfriend to talk to his own children. However, the girlfriend might feel that the parent is not supporting her and is instead using the child as a third party to mediate. It's possible that the conversation was framed in a way that made the son feel like he's part of a conflict, which isn't healthy. The parent's mistake might be not considering how the child would interpret the conversation and not approaching the girlfriend about the child's well-being in a collaborative way. So, the parent's intentions were good, but maybe the execution was lacking. It's a gray area, but leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're responsible for their children. The girlfriend's overreaction might be more about how she feels about being included in the conversation rather than the conversation itself. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
