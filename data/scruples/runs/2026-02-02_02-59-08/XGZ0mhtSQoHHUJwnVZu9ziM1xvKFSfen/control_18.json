My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, after some feedback from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the situation, including his mother being away and his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her, and left the house.\n\nSo, the key points here: the father's intention was to check in with his son about how he's feeling, which is a responsible parenting action. The issue is whether discussing the stepmother's role with the child is inappropriate. The girlfriend feels her authority or position is being questioned. But the father argues that he needs to talk to his kids without prior approval from his girlfriend. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important for children to express their feelings about all the people in their lives, including step-parents or partners. The father is fulfilling his role by ensuring his child is comfortable and not being negatively affected. The girlfriend might feel hurt or insecure because the conversation was about her, but the father's action was for the child's well-being. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, as the father didn't undermine her intentionally. He was addressing the child's emotional needs. However, maybe he could have involved the girlfriend in the conversation if there were concerns, but the main issue is the child's perspective. So, the father isn't wrong for wanting to protect the child's feelings and ensure the stepmother is a positive influence. The girlfriend's insecurity might be a separate issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he was acting in the best interest of his child.\n"
