My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and she recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Then, after seeing comments that the kids might be picking up on the tension, he talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted angrily, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her.\n\nThe key question is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was wrong. Parents often need to discuss family dynamics with their children, especially when there are changes like a new partner or living arrangements. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend directly. However, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to ensure the children's feelings are considered. The author did what many parents would do\u2014ask their child how they're coping with family changes. But the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect the child's perception of her, especially if it's not framed neutrally. There's a balance between a parent's duty to their child and respecting the partner's boundaries.\n\nThe author argues that he didn't go to his son to undermine the girlfriend, and the conversation was about both his ex-wife's absence and the new situation. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected. The issue here is communication. The author didn't consult her before talking to the son, which could be seen as not respecting her in the relationship. But since the child is his, the parent has a right to discuss family matters with them without prior approval from a partner.\n\nOn the other hand, in a healthy relationship, partners should communicate about family decisions that affect both. The author might have violated that by not discussing the conversation with his girlfriend first, especially if it involved her. However, since the child is his biological son, the parent's need to talk to them about their feelings is critical for the child's well-being. The girlfriend might be overreacting, but her feelings are valid in that she might feel criticized indirectly.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the conversation was neutral and aimed at the child's well-being without any negative commentary, then no. However, if the conversation made the girlfriend feel undermined, maybe the approach could have been more considerate. But the parent's responsibility to the child is paramount. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive, but the author could have handled the situation more sensitively by involving her in the discussion first. However, given that the child is his, the author isn't necessarily wrong for talking to him. The answer might hinge on whether the conversation was fair and respectful. Since the author says he didn't intend to undermine, and the child's well-being is a priority, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But there's a gray area here. The girlfriend's feelings are important too, so maybe the author could have approached it differently. But ultimately, the parent has a right to talk to their child about their family without needing permission from a partner. So the answer is B.\n"
