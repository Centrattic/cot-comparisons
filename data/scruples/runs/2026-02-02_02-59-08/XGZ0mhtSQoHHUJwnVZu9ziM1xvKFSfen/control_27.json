My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the user, a 44-year-old man, is living with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her being upset and calling him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend and his mother, which the girlfriend found offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's main concern was about his children's well-being after receiving feedback that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. He initiated a conversation with his son to check in on his feelings, which is a responsible thing for a parent to do. The son was happy, so that's positive.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend took offense, feeling undermined and betrayed. The key issue here is whether talking to the kids about the girlfriend was appropriate. The user argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission, which makes sense because parents have a right to communicate with their children about family matters. But the way he approached it might have been a problem. If he discussed the girlfriend's role in the household and her relationship with the kids without considering her feelings, that could hurt her.\n\nBut wait, the user's intention was to check on the kids' well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. The conversation was also about the son's mother being away, so it wasn't solely focused on the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014storming out, saying the user has the maturity of a 6-year-old, and needing to rethink the relationship. That's a lot of backlash for a conversation that was meant to be about the kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that talking to the kids about her could make them question her role in the family. If the user didn't frame the conversation properly or if the kids felt they had to take sides, that could be an issue. However, as a parent, the user has a duty to assess how the kids are adjusting to the new family dynamic, especially since the girlfriend is now a significant part of their lives.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her position isn't respected. But the user isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his children are okay. It's a delicate balance, but the user's actions seem reasonable. The problem might be in the communication between the two adults. If the user had talked to the girlfriend first about his concerns with the kids, maybe she wouldn't have felt blindsided. However, the user's main responsibility is to his children, and he shouldn't need permission to talk to them about their lives.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong. He acted in the best interest of his children, and the girlfriend's reaction is over the top. The issue might be more about their communication and trust rather than the user's actions being inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
