My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and his ex-wife is away. He asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to some conflict. Then he sat down with his oldest son to discuss how the kid feels about living with the girlfriend and the mother being away. The girlfriend found out and got very upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, the key point is the right of a parent to talk to their child about their living arrangements and the people in their life. Parents generally have the responsibility to understand their children's feelings and perspectives, especially when major life changes occur, like moving in with a new partner or a parent being away. The author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. The conversation included both the situation with the ex and the girlfriend, so it's a balanced discussion.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels that the conversation was an attack on her and that the author lacks confidence in her. But as an adult, the author has the right to discuss his children's feelings without needing permission from his partner. The girlfriend's response might be more about her insecurities or feeling threatened rather than the conversation itself. However, the way the author approached the conversation might matter. Was it done in a respectful and supportive way? If the son felt comfortable sharing his thoughts and the conversation was constructive, then the father acted appropriately. \n\nAnother angle is communication between the author and his girlfriend. If he had discussed his concerns with her first before talking to the son, maybe some issues could have been avoided. But the author didn't do that, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's hurt feelings. However, the necessity to prioritize the children's emotional well-being often takes precedence over the partner's feelings, especially when the children's adjustment is a key factor.\n\nThe author argues that he's just doing his duty as a parent to ensure his son is okay. The girlfriend's overreaction might indicate trust issues or insecurity. Since the author's intention was not to undermine but to assess his son's well-being, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's response is extreme, and he has the right to parent without needing his partner's approval. So, the answer is B.\n"
