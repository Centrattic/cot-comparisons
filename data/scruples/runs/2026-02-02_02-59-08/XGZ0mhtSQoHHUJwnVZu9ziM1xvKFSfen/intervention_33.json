My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation involves a parent-teenager dynamic, a new partner, and some recent tension.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to check in with his son about how he feels about the living arrangement and his stepmom. He mentions that others advised him to consider the kids' perspectives in his previous Reddit post. The son seemed okay with it, but the girlfriend took offense, feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nSo, the key points are: talking to a child about a parent's partner, the partner's reaction, and whether the parent overstepped. In most cases, parents have the right to discuss family matters with their children, especially their feelings and perceptions. However, if the conversation was critical or intended to undermine the partner, that's different. Here, the author states the conversation was about both the ex-wife and the girlfriend, not just being negative. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected. The author might not have considered how the conversation would be perceived as a challenge to her authority or presence in the household. Even if the intent was good, not discussing it with the girlfriend beforehand could have been a misstep. However, the parent's need to communicate with their child is valid. \n\nThe question is whether the parent wronged the girlfriend by having the conversation. The answer hinges on whether the conversation was justified as part of parenting and if there was a lack of communication between the parent and girlfriend. The parent is not wrong for wanting to ensure their child is okay. However, the manner in which the conversation was conducted might have been a problem. \n\nIn many cases, open communication between partners about co-parenting is essential. If the parent had discussed the conversation with the girlfriend first, it might have prevented the issue. But the parent isn't wrong for talking to the child. So, probably answer B (author not in the wrong), because parenting often requires such discussions, and the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, not the parent's right to talk to their child.\n"
