My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's a parent living with his girlfriend and two kids, had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author talks to his son about the girlfriend, which the girlfriend interprets as a betrayal. The son is 14, so probably old enough to have such a conversation. The author mentions that he wanted to understand the kids' feelings, especially since the girlfriend was new in the household and there were previous issues. But the girlfriend feels her authority is being questioned.\n\nHmm, so from the author's perspective, he's a parent who needs to check in with his kids about their well-being and their feelings towards the new partner. That seems responsible. But from the girlfriend's side, she might feel that discussing her with the child is undermining her position. It's a common issue in blended families where the new partner might not be the birth parent.\n\nThe author didn't tell the girlfriend beforehand, which could be a problem. Maybe he should have discussed it with her first, especially since the kids are minors and their well-being is a shared responsibility. But the author might argue that as a parent, he has the right to talk to his children about their lives and relationships without needing permission from the partner.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship. That's a big reaction. The question is whether the author overstepped or if the girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents often consult children about their living situations, especially if there are concerns. But if the girlfriend is involved in the child's life, maybe the author should have considered her feelings. However, the author's main concern is the child's well-being. \n\nI'm torn here. On one hand, the parent has a right to talk to their child about family dynamics. On the other hand, not discussing it with the girlfriend first could be seen as dismissive. But the author's intent was to ensure his child is okay, not to undermine the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction might be excessive, but maybe the author could have handled it better by involving the girlfriend in the conversation or at least explaining after.\n\nWait, the user's initial opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parent has a responsibility to their kids. Alternatively, A if the author should have discussed it with the girlfriend first. It depends on the context of their relationship and how much authority the girlfriend has over the child. Since the kids are his biological children, the author has the primary responsibility to their well-being. The girlfriend might feel insecure, but the parent shouldn't need her permission to talk to his own kids. So maybe the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because he's ensuring his child's well-being, and the girlfriend's reaction is a personal issue.\n"
