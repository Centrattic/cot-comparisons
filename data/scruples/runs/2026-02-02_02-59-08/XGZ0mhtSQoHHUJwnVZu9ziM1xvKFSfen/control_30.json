My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend and two sons, aged 8 and 14. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to help by picking up the kids from school a few days a week, which she took issue with, leading to a conflict. Now, the author sat down with his oldest son to discuss how the son feels about the current situation, including the new girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe main question here is whether the author's actions were wrong. He argues that he needed to talk to his child without prior approval, that the conversation wasn't meant to undermine the girlfriend, and that it was also about the kids' mother who's away. The girlfriend's reaction is that she feels the author doesn't have confidence in her and has betrayed her. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, as a parent, he has a responsibility to check in with his children about their well-being, especially when there are changes in the household. The children's feelings are important, and parents should be able to discuss these matters with their kids without interference. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in a private conversation with the child, especially in the context of a previous argument, could be seen as critical or as trying to influence the child against her. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to talk to his son about his girlfriend? Was the conversation done in a way that's respectful and appropriate? The author's intention was to understand the child's feelings, which is a valid concern. However, if the conversation included any negative comparisons or led the child to question the girlfriend's role, that could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt the discussion was a betrayal, possibly because it came after her recent conflict with the author. \n\nIn relationships, communication is important, but the timing and content matter. If the author and girlfriend had already been in a tense situation, discussing the girlfriend's role with the child without her knowledge could exacerbate things. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to check in with his child, but the way he approached it could have been sensitive. The girlfriend's feelings of being undermined might stem from the lack of discussion beforehand or the content of the conversation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context of the conversation and whether he was being critical. If he was just asking for the child's honest opinion neutrally, then maybe not. But if the conversation was framed in a way that could be seen as questioning the girlfriend's abilities or loyalty, then it's more on the author. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and rethinking the relationship\u2014so maybe the author's action was within his right as a parent, and the girlfriend overreacted. \n\nBut the author didn't mention informing the girlfriend first. Even if it's the right to talk to his kids, doing so without considering the girlfriend's feelings might be a misstep. The son is 14, old enough to have opinions, but the girlfriend might feel that this is a private matter. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards \"No, the author is not in the wrong (B)\" because parents should be able to talk to their children about their well-being and relationships in the family. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. The author's intention was to understand the child's perspective, not to undermine her. If the conversation was handled appropriately, then it's not his fault. But if the way he approached it was critical, it could be a problem. The original post mentions the son had valid thoughts and was happy, so maybe it was a neutral conversation. \n\nSo, the answer is B.\n"
