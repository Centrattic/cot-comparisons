My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The original situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. After some comments on Reddit suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, the author talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, especially considering his mother's absence and the new living arrangement. The author believes he's doing his duty as a parent, ensuring his child's feelings are considered. However, the girlfriend perceives this conversation as a lack of trust and confidence in her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. From a parental perspective, it's generally considered important to communicate with children about their feelings and adjust family dynamics accordingly. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt her autonomy was disrespected. The author didn't consult her before talking to the child, which might have been a misstep in handling the situation diplomatically.\n\nBut the author's primary responsibility is to his children's emotional well-being. If there were concerns about the girlfriend's behavior affecting the kids, it's reasonable for the author to seek his son's perspective. However, the manner in which he approached it might have been problematic. Perhaps he should have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend first or included her in the conversation to maintain trust and collaboration.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction seems excessive. If she felt her input was necessary, she might have expected the author to involve her more. But the author's action was about the child's welfare, not undermining her. There's a balance between parental responsibility and maintaining trust in a relationship. The author might have failed to communicate his intentions clearly to the girlfriend to avoid her feeling betrayed.\n\nIn summary, while the author had a valid reason to talk to his son, the way he did it without considering the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as insensitive. However, the core issue is whether he's wrong in prioritizing his child's well-being. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the author's action was for his child's benefit and he didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend, he might not be entirely at fault. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author's action is within his rights as a parent. So the answer might be B (No), but there's room for the author to improve communication with the girlfriend.\n"
