My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a dad with two kids, 8 and 14 years old. He's living with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job. He's supporting her financially and asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some Reddit comments made him think about how the kids might be affected, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he's feeling and his perceptions of the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and is really upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are: the author talked to his son about his girlfriend and his ex-wife's absence. The girlfriend is taking it as a personal attack and a betrayal. The author feels he's just doing his job as a parent to check in with his kids, especially given the recent stress with the girlfriend losing her job and the kids' mom being away.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parent-child relationship. Parents often talk to their kids about various family dynamics, including relationships. The author is concerned about his children's well-being and how they're adjusting to his girlfriend living with them and his ex-wife's absence. It's reasonable for a parent to want to ensure their kids are okay, especially when there are significant changes like job loss and a new family structure.\n\nHowever, the way he approached it might be an issue. Did he ask his son about his girlfriend in a way that was critical or judgmental? The author mentions the conversation was as much about the mother's trip as about the girlfriend. If the discussion was balanced and aimed at understanding the kids' feelings, that's good parenting. But if it came across as a parent badmouthing the girlfriend, that could be problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings are valid in some ways. When a partner discusses a significant other with their child, especially in the context of the child's perception of the partner, it can be seen as undermining the partner's authority or making the partner feel insecure. The girlfriend might feel that her role in the family is being questioned or that she's not being trusted.\n\nNow, considering the author's responsibility as a parent. He has a duty to ensure his children's emotional health. If he noticed that the kids might be picking up on tension or discomfort because of the girlfriend's situation, talking to them is a responsible action. However, the method of communication matters. Did he frame the conversation in a way that was non-judgmental and supportive, or did he lead the child to criticize the girlfriend? The original post says the son had valid thoughts and was happy, so maybe the conversation was more about the child's feelings than criticism of the girlfriend.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's reaction. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. That's a strong response. Maybe she felt that the conversation was a breach of trust. If the author had discussed the girlfriend in a way that was negative, that could be an issue. But the author claims the conversation was balanced and necessary for the child's well-being.\n\nAlso, the context from the previous Reddit post where people suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness to be there. The author took that into account and had the conversation, which shows he's being proactive about his children's emotional needs.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is important too. She might feel that her role in the family is being questioned, especially since she's the new partner. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and if the author went to his son without her knowledge, she might feel excluded or not respected. However, talking to one's children about family dynamics is a standard parental duty. It's part of being a parent to discuss the family structure with the kids.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a balance between the parent's responsibility to their children and respecting the partner's feelings. If the author had a legitimate concern about his children's adjustment and addressed it in a non-critical way, he's justified. However, if the conversation was more about the parent's own doubts about the girlfriend, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author states he didn't go to undermine the girlfriend and that the conversation was about the child's feelings. Since the son reported being okay, maybe the author did the right thing. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her position in the family is being undermined, which is a valid concern, but it's also possible she's overreacting.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are within his parental role to check in with his children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is intense but may be based on her own insecurities. The author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his kids are okay, but maybe he could have handled it differently to avoid making the girlfriend feel attacked. However, given the information presented, it's more about the girlfriend's sensitivity rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
