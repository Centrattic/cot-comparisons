My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has two sons, lives with his girlfriend, and the girlfriend recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son to check in on how he's feeling about the situation, especially regarding his mother being away and the new living arrangement. The girlfriend found out and got very upset, claiming he undermined her confidence and betrayed her. The author is now asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author's intention was to check in with his son, not to criticize the girlfriend. He mentions that the conversation was also about the son's mother being away. The girlfriend took it as a betrayal and a lack of trust.\n\nNow, considering typical family dynamics, parents often need to talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including relationships with other adults in the household. However, the girlfriend's reaction is significant here. She feels that the conversation was undermining her. But is the author wrong for having that conversation?\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's a parent who needs to ensure his children's well-being, and talking to them about their feelings is necessary. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling untrusted or undervalued. But the author didn't ask the son to criticize the girlfriend; he just wanted to know how the son was feeling. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, generally, parents have the right to talk to their children about their experiences and relationships. However, if the conversation was specifically critical of the girlfriend without her knowledge, that could be problematic. But the author clarifies that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend\u2014it was also about the mother's absence. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If she's living in the household, she might expect that her role and relationship with the kids are part of the family dynamics. Parents discussing family matters with their children is usually appropriate. However, if the conversation was framed in a way that made the girlfriend feel attacked, that could be an issue. But the author states his intent was not to undermine her.\n\nI need to consider if there's a breach of trust or if the author overstepped. If he had a discussion with the child about his feelings towards the girlfriend, especially if the child expressed negative views, that could be a concern. But the author mentions that the son was happy with the current situation, indicating that the conversation wasn't negative.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend might have felt that discussing her with the child without her input was a violation. However, the author's intention was to ensure the child's well-being. It's a delicate balance between parental responsibility and respecting the partner's feelings.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He acted out of concern for his child's well-being and to address potential issues before they become problems. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be more about her own insecurities than the actual action of talking to the child. The author's approach seems appropriate as a parent, and as long as the conversation wasn't malicious, it's not his fault.\n"
