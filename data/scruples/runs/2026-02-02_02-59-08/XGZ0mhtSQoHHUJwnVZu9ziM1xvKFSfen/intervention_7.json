My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids, which led to her getting upset. Then he talked to his oldest son to check how the kids are feeling about the situation, which the girlfriend found offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, which seems like a responsible parent's action. Kids do pick up on their parents' relationships, so wanting to make sure they're okay makes sense. But the girlfriend felt undermined, thinking the author lacked confidence in her. \n\nIs talking to the child about the girlfriend inherently wrong? Well, parents should be able to discuss family matters with their children, especially when it affects them. However, the way the conversation was handled might be an issue. Did the author approach the topic in a way that was critical of the girlfriend without considering her feelings? The author mentions the conversation was about both the ex-wife (mother) being away and the girlfriend. If the focus was balanced, maybe it's reasonable. But if it leaned towards negative perceptions of the girlfriend, that could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left and wants to rethink the relationship. That's a big response. The author might not have considered how sensitive this topic is for the girlfriend. Even though the intent was to check on the kid, maybe it's necessary to discuss such things with the partner first? But the author argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without permission. That's a valid point, but relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the girlfriend felt blindsided, maybe the author should have discussed the conversation with her beforehand.\n\nOn one hand, the parent's responsibility to the child's well-being is important. On the other, partners in a relationship need to trust and respect each other's boundaries. The key here is whether the author crossed a boundary by discussing the girlfriend in a way that undermined her without her knowledge. If the conversation was objective and aimed at the child's welfare, the author might not be wrong. But if the discussion was negative or critical, that's different.\n\nThe original Reddit post's summary says the author talked to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend, which is part of assessing the child's adjustment. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected. The question is whether the method was appropriate. The author might not be wrong in intent, but maybe the execution was poor. However, the answer depends on cultural or situational norms. In many cases, discussing a partner with a child is part of co-parenting, but it's possible the author didn't frame it correctly. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action was to check on the child's feelings, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from her own insecurities or feeling criticized. The author might not be in the wrong, but the situation highlights a communication issue in the relationship. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
