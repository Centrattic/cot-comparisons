My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two sons, aged 8 and 14. The older son was the one he talked to, so the 14-year-old. The author's girlfriend was upset that he discussed the girlfriend with the son, perceiving it as a betrayal and lack of trust. \n\nThe author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to his mom being away and how he feels about living with the girlfriend. The son was happy, which the author was relieved about. The problem arose because the girlfriend felt undermined and left the house. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong to have that conversation. Let's look at both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's a parent, and it's reasonable to want to ensure his children are comfortable and adjusting well to the new living arrangements. He didn't consult his girlfriend beforehand, but he did mention that the conversation was also about the mother being away. Since he's the parent, he has a responsibility to his children's well-being, and talking to them about family dynamics is part of that. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She might feel that being discussed without her knowledge could lead to the child forming negative opinions or feeling divided. She could see the conversation as a lack of trust, especially if she's in a new or sensitive situation. The fact that she left the house shows she felt deeply hurt.\n\nBut the key here is the parent's role. Parents have the right to discuss family matters with their children. The author didn't intend to criticize the girlfriend; he was just assessing his son's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to her own insecurities or the stress of losing her job and being in a new family dynamic. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, when does a parent's responsibility to their children cross into overstepping with their partner? The author didn't share the conversation's content with the girlfriend first, which could have been a point of contention. However, in many cases, parents should be allowed to talk to their kids without needing permission from a partner. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme if the conversation was neutral and aimed at the child's well-being. However, the author might have handled it better by perhaps setting up a family discussion where he could address both the child's and girlfriend's feelings. But given the situation, the author's intention was not to undermine the girlfriend, so he might not be at fault.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's reaction might be valid if she felt the child was being used as a sounding board, but the author's primary duty is to his children. It's possible that the girlfriend's insecurity is the bigger issue here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a necessary part of being a parent, and while communication with the girlfriend could have been better, the act of talking to his son isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
