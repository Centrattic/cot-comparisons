My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me read through the provided scenario carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a dad living with his girlfriend and two boys. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how the kids perceive the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was extremely upset, thinking he undermined her and lacked confidence in her. She left to stay with a friend and said she needs to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he needed to talk to his kids as a parent, without needing permission from his girlfriend. He felt it was important to understand their feelings about the changes, like their mom being away and living with the girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, felt betrayed and undermined.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, parents have a responsibility to check in with their children about their well-being and emotional state, especially during times of change. The author had a valid reason to talk to his son about how the household changes affect him. That conversation seems appropriate as part of being a responsible parent.\n\nHowever, the author didn't consider how discussing the girlfriend in that conversation might make her feel. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt her role and status in the family were being questioned. The key here is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend's role without her knowledge, even if the intent was to understand the kids' perspectives.\n\nThe author's defense is that he's an adult and needed to talk to his kids without needing permission. But relationships often require mutual respect and communication. While it's reasonable to talk to children about family dynamics, bringing up the girlfriend in a way that could be perceived as evaluating her performance might be sensitive. The girlfriend might feel that her authority or position in the household was being undermined, especially if she's not the legal parent.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the previous conflict. The author had previously asked the girlfriend to take on more childcare responsibilities, which led to tension. The son's perception could naturally include how he feels about the new caregiver, which in this case is the girlfriend. The father's conversation might have been necessary but perhaps the way it was approached, or the inclusion of the girlfriend's role without her input, caused friction.\n\nBut the father's action itself\u2014talking to his son about his feelings towards the girlfriend\u2014doesn't inherently seem wrong. Parents should be able to discuss their children's feelings about different family members. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity or the lack of communication between the couple, rather than the father being wrong.\n\nHowever, there's a line where discussing a partner's role in front of the children without considering the partner's feelings could be problematic. The father might have a responsibility to consider how his actions affect the relationship dynamics. But in this case, the primary duty is to the children's well-being.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Leaving the house over this might indicate that the issue is more about the existing tensions from the previous argument. The father is trying to do his duty as a parent, which should be allowed. Unless he was actively criticizing the girlfriend in front of the child, which isn't indicated here, the conversation seems appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend might be upset and the situation is awkward, the father's action of talking to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend doesn't make him the asshole. The responsibility of a parent to check in with their children's feelings outweighs the girlfriend's potential feelings of being undermined unless there's direct criticism. The problem seems to stem from the girlfriend's insecurity and the prior conflict rather than the father's intent.\n"
