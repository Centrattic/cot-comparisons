My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a man in his 40s, lives with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few times a week, which she got upset about and called him an asshole. Then, after getting feedback from Reddit that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, the author talked to his son about how he perceives the girlfriend and their mom. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The key points are: the author had a conversation with his son about his perceptions of the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend took it as a personal attack and left. The author's reasoning is that he's a parent who needs to talk to his kids about their well-being without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's action was to check in with his son about how he's feeling, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend, however, felt that the conversation was a criticism of her and a lack of trust. But the author's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, not to undermine the girlfriend. The conversation included both the mom being away and the girlfriend, so it's not just about the girlfriend.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not wrong for talking to his son. Parents have the right and duty to communicate with their children about their living situations, especially when there's a new adult in the household. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about feeling disrespected or threatened, but the author didn't cross any boundary by discussing the kids' perceptions. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity or miscommunication. The author didn't go to the son to criticize the girlfriend; he was concerned about the kids' adjustment. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B). The girlfriend's reaction is valid in that she felt hurt, but the author's action was justified as part of his parental role.\n"
