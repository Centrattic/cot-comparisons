My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a dad, talked to his 14-year-old son about how the son perceives the dad's girlfriend. The girlfriend gets really upset, thinking he's undermining her, and leaves the house. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, especially since the girlfriend had issues with her job and the kids' needs. The girlfriend feels betrayed and not trusted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dad had a conversation with his son to check in on the kids' feelings, which the girlfriend found offensive. The dad's intention was to ensure the kids were okay, but the girlfriend felt her position was being questioned. \n\nNow, the question is whether the dad was wrong. On one hand, parents have a right to talk to their children about their family dynamics, especially when there are changes like a new partner or a parent being away. The dad might have thought it necessary to make sure his son isn't being negatively affected by the girlfriend's role in their lives. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she feels undermined and betrayed. The dad didn't consult her before talking to the son, which might have caused her to feel insecure or disrespected.\n\nBut wait, the dad mentioned that the conversation was about both the kids' mother being away and the girlfriend. So maybe he was trying to address the son's feelings about both situations. The girlfriend might feel that discussing her in a private conversation with her stepson is a breach of trust, especially if she didn't know about it beforehand. However, the dad is the parent, so he has a responsibility to his children's emotional well-being, regardless of the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top. If she's not comfortable with the dad discussing her with their son, maybe she should have addressed that earlier. But the dad didn't approach it to criticize her; he wanted to check in on the kids. So, maybe the dad wasn't wrong in having the conversation. However, maybe he could have handled it differently, like involving the girlfriend in the discussion to avoid misunderstanding. But the main issue is whether he was in the wrong for talking to his son. Since he's the parent, it's his role to communicate with his children about family matters. The girlfriend's reaction might be a problem, but the dad isn't the one at fault here. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
