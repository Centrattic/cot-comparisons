My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has two sons, aged 8 and 14. He lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset about that. Then, the author talked to his oldest son (14) about how the son felt about the girlfriend and the situation with his mother being away. The girlfriend found out and got extremely upset, accusing the author of undermining her and lacking confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's an adult and needs to be able to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend. He felt that talking to his son was necessary to check in on the kids' well-being and that the conversation was about both his ex-wife and the girlfriend. He's asking if he's in the wrong here.\n\nNow, the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're curious for another perspective. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nLet me break it down. Parents have the right to discuss their children's feelings and their family dynamics. However, the way the conversation was approached might be the issue. If the author had a concern about his son's adjustment to the new living situation with the girlfriend, talking to the son is valid. But the girlfriend felt undermined. Was the author supposed to consult her first? \n\nIn a co-parenting situation, especially with a step-parent, communication is key. The author might have thought it was necessary to ensure his son's well-being, but perhaps the way it was done came across as a lack of trust in the girlfriend. The girlfriend might feel that her role as a step-mother is being questioned. \n\nBut then again, parents should be able to discuss their children's feelings without interference. The issue could be whether the conversation was done in a way that was respectful and considerate of the girlfriend's position. Maybe the author didn't frame the conversation properly, making it seem like he was criticizing her. However, the author claims the conversation was equally about the mother's trip and the girlfriend, not just the girlfriend. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's reaction seems harsh. She left the house and wants to break up over this. That might be an overreaction. The author is trying to prioritize his children's emotional health, which is a parent's responsibility. If the girlfriend is part of the household, the children's perception of her is important, and the parent should be aware of that. \n\nBut maybe the author should have discussed this with his girlfriend first. If the conversation with the son was about the girlfriend's role in the household, perhaps the author should have involved her in the discussion to avoid making her feel undermined. However, the main purpose was to check in with the child, not to evaluate the girlfriend. \n\nIn summary, the author's intent was to understand his son's feelings, which is a valid reason. However, the girlfriend's feelings were hurt because she perceived it as a lack of trust. The question is whether the author should have been more sensitive to her feelings. But ultimately, a parent's duty to their children's well-being is primary. The girlfriend's reaction might be excessive. So, the author might not be in the wrong for discussing his son's feelings, even if it upset the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances.\n"
