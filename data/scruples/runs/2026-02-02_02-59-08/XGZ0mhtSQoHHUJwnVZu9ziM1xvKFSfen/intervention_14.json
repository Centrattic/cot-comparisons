My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Now, after feedback from Reddit, he decided to talk to his 14-year-old son about how the son feels about the situation, including his thoughts on the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, considering the changes in his family dynamics. The girlfriend is upset because she feels her position is being questioned. But the father argues that he needs to talk to his children independently.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to discuss their children's feelings with them. However, the issue here might be whether the father discussed the girlfriend in a way that could be seen as critical or undermining. The father says the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. The son's feelings are important, but the girlfriend's reaction is about her feeling disrespected.\n\nThe father didn't consult the girlfriend before the conversation, which might be a point of contention. But as an adult, he has the autonomy to make decisions about his children. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly due to insecurity or feeling that her role isn't respected. However, the father's actions, while well-intentioned, could be seen as a breach of trust if the expectation was to discuss the girlfriend with prior consent. \n\nBut since the father's primary responsibility is to his children, having open conversations with them is part of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from personal issues rather than the action itself. So, while the father might have handled it differently, the act of talking to his son isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
