My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, the author went to talk to his oldest son (14 years old) about how the kids are feeling about the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is furious, thinking he undermined her and doesn't have confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend and is rethinking the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the father's actions. He wanted to check in with his son to see how the kids are feeling, especially since there was advice in the previous Reddit comments about the kids sensing the tension. The father had a conversation that was \"just as much about his ex-wife's trip as it was about his girlfriend.\" So, he's trying to ensure the kids are okay, not just focusing on the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She took it as a personal attack, feeling undermined. But the father's main responsibility is his children's well-being. It's a parent's duty to talk to their kids about their living situation and how they're adjusting. However, he did not consult his girlfriend first, which might be a point of contention.\n\nBut wait, in a relationship, communication is key. The father might have thought it necessary to talk to his son without informing his girlfriend, but this might have caused hurt feelings. However, the father's primary role is to his children. He's not doing this to criticize the girlfriend but to ensure the kids are okay. The girlfriend's perception that he lacks confidence in her is a problem, but the father's action was about the children's welfare.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the father should have considered how the girlfriend might feel. Maybe discussing her in front of the child without prior communication could affect the child's perception. However, the father's intent wasn't to undermine her; he was focused on the kids' feelings. The girl's reaction seems over the top, but the father's action was appropriate in terms of parental duty.\n\nSo, the father isn't wrong in wanting to ensure his children's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurities. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
