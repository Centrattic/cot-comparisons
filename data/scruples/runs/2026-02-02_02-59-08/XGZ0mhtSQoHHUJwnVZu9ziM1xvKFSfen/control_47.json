My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 44-year-old man, has two kids and a live-in girlfriend. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, and she got upset. Then, after some people commented that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness, the author talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, thinking he undermined her and didn't have confidence in her. Now the author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's adjusting to having a step-parent, which seems like a reasonable thing for a parent to do. However, the girlfriend took it as an attack, feeling undermined. The key here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was appropriate. \n\nIn parent-step-parent dynamics, communication is important. The author might have thought it necessary to ensure his son's well-being, but he didn't inform his girlfriend first. However, he's the parent, so he has the right to talk to his kids about family matters. That being said, maybe he could have approached the conversation differently. For example, discussing it with the girlfriend first to avoid her feeling attacked. But the main point is that the kids' well-being is a parent's responsibility, and talking to them about family dynamics isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship. That's a significant response to a conversation that was meant to be about the child's feelings. The author wasn't criticizing her in front of the child; he was just listening to the child's perspective. The girlfriend's insecurity might stem from her own feelings of being unwelcome or not trusted, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without permission. That's a valid point. Parents should be able to have open lines of communication with their children, especially regarding their own family situations. The girlfriend's reaction could be a sign of deeper issues in their relationship, such as lack of trust or communication. However, the author's actions themselves don't seem to be inherently wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have been more considerate of her feelings. If he had shared his concerns with her and then talked to the kids together, that might have helped. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for talking to his son alone. Since the intention was to understand the child's feelings and ensure his adjustment, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's overreaction doesn't make him the asshole here. So the answer is B (No).\n"
