My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent talking to their son about how the son perceives the parent's girlfriend. The parent wanted to check in on the kids' feelings since there were concerns from others about the girlfriend not being fully there for the kids. The son seemed okay, but the girlfriend got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intention. The parent says they wanted to talk to the kids about both the ex-mother's absence and the current girlfriend's role. That seems reasonable because the kids' well-being is important. Parents often have to discuss such matters to ensure their children are adjusting well, especially during transitions like a new partner in the household.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is a big part here. She felt that the parent discussed her without her knowledge, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the parent's intention was good, the execution might have been problematic. The parent didn't consult the girlfriend beforehand, which could be a point of contention. In a relationship, mutual respect is key. If the parent had included the girlfriend in discussions about the kids' well-being, maybe the situation wouldn't have escalated.\n\nAnother angle is the age of the children. The oldest is 14, which is a teenager. Parents often have more open conversations with teens about family dynamics. However, discussing the parent's partner in depth with the child could influence the child's perception, especially if the partner feels it's being done without support.\n\nThe parent argues that they need to talk to the kids without needing permission. But maybe the parent should have shared their intention to have the conversation with the girlfriend first, to set expectations and show that the girlfriend's role is valued. The girlfriend's feeling of being undermined might stem from not being involved in the process, even if the parent's goal was to check on the kids.\n\nAlso, considering the context from the previous Reddit post, the parent had issues with the girlfriend not wanting to be there for the kids. This might have led to the parent's decision to check in with the son, which the girlfriend now sees as a lack of trust. It's a delicate balance between a parent's responsibility to their children and maintaining a respectful relationship with a new partner.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the parent had approached the girlfriend first, explaining that they wanted to talk to the kids about how they're adjusting, maybe the girlfriend wouldn't have felt attacked. The parent's action, while well-intentioned, might have overlooked the girlfriend's feelings due to poor communication.\n\nSo, the parent's mistake might not be in talking to the child but in not discussing it with the girlfriend first. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt betrayed, and the parent could have handled it more sensitively. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's perspective and not maintaining open communication.\n"
