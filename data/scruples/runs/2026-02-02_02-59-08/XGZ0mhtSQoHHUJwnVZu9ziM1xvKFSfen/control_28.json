My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a father who lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, the author decided to talk to his oldest son (14) about how he perceives the situation, including his feelings about his mother (who's not present) and his stepmom. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, saying he undermined her and that he lacks confidence in her, leading her to leave the house to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author's defense is that he's an adult and has a right to talk to his kids without needing permission from the girlfriend. He also mentions the conversation was about both the kids' mother's absence and the girlfriend's role.\n\nNow, considering the scenario, the main issue is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son. The father's intention was to check in on the kids' well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend feels her authority and position in the family are being questioned. \n\nIn many cases, when one partner discusses a partner's performance in front of the children, it can be seen as undermining. The father might have thought it was necessary for the kids' emotional health, but the way it was handled could have been sensitive. If the father had included the girlfriend in the conversation or discussed it with her first, it might have been better. But since the kids are his, he has a right to talk to them about family dynamics affecting them.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. However, her feelings of being undermined might be valid if the conversation was about her in a critical way without her input. The father should have considered her perspective but isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to ensure his child's well-being. \n\nBalancing both sides, the father's action wasn't malicious, but perhaps the approach could have been more collaborative. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also a significant factor. Since the father's intent was to protect his child's interests and he's responsible for his children's welfare, he's not in the wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
