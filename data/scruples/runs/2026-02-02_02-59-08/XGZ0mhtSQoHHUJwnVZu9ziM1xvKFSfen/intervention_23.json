My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves a co-parenting arrangement where the author's girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to pick up the kids from school. The girlfriend got upset when the author discussed her with their son, thinking it undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's intent. He wanted to check in with his son about how he's feeling, especially given the changes in family dynamics. He wasn't directly criticizing the girlfriend but wanted to ensure the kids were okay. That seems reasonable for a parent to do.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She felt undermined and betrayed, which is a strong emotional response. The key here is whether the parent's conversation with the son was appropriate. Parents should have open lines of communication with their children about family matters, but they also need to be mindful of how their actions might affect the other parent, especially if the child is still building a relationship with them.\n\nThe question is whether the conversation was necessary and how it was handled. The parent did mention that the conversation was about both the ex-wife (mother) and the girlfriend. But the girlfriend's perception is that it was about her, leading to her feeling undermined. The parent didn't consult the girlfriend before the talk, which might have been a misstep. In co-parenting situations, especially after a divorce, it's important to maintain the other parent's authority in front of the children. Even though the girlfriend is a partner, not a legal co-parent, the parent might have considered how his actions could affect the girlfriend's relationship with the kids.\n\nSo, the parent's action might be seen as overstepping if it's perceived as criticizing the girlfriend in front of the child, even if that wasn't the intention. The parent needs to balance the child's well-being with the partner's feelings. Since the girlfriend left and the situation escalated, it's possible that the parent didn't handle the conversation in a way that respected the girlfriend's position. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's perspective and not having a discussion with her first before addressing the son.\n"
