My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a dad living with his girlfriend and his two kids. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, he's talking to his oldest son about how the kid perceives the girlfriend and his mom who's away. The girlfriend found out and is really angry, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. As a parent, he has a responsibility to check in with his kids about their well-being and their feelings about the people in their lives. His girlfriend is part of the household, so it's reasonable for him to want to know how the kids perceive her. But the issue is that the girlfriend feels her position is being undermined. \n\nHe mentions that the conversation with the son wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about his ex-wife's absence. However, the girlfriend might still feel singled out or criticized. The key point is whether talking to the kids about the girlfriend is an overreach or a necessary part of parenting.\n\nOn one hand, parents should be able to discuss their children's feelings with them to ensure they're adjusting well. On the other hand, if the girlfriend feels that this conversation was a form of evaluation or criticism, it could be seen as disrespectful. The problem might be in how the conversation was approached. Did he approach it as a neutral inquiry or as a way to assess her performance?\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is in a vulnerable position since she recently lost her job and is relying on him financially. This might make her more sensitive to any perceived criticism. If the conversation made her feel like she's not meeting expectations, that could be why she reacted so strongly. \n\nBut is it the father's fault? He argues that he needed to talk to his kids without permission. That's true because as a parent, he should have the autonomy to discuss his children's well-being. However, if he did it in a way that was critical or made her feel like she's being judged, that's where he could be in the wrong. The way he framed the conversation might matter. If he was genuinely trying to understand the kids' perspectives without bias, then it's reasonable. But if it came across as a test or evaluation, then maybe not.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014leaving the house and saying the relationship needs reevaluation. That's a big response. It might indicate that she felt attacked, even if the father's intent was purely to check in. So, while the father's action might be justified, the manner in which he conducted the conversation could be at fault. \n\nAlternatively, if the father had discussed the conversation with the girlfriend first or approached it in a way that included her, maybe the outcome would have been different. But he didn't, and now the girlfriend feels betrayed. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, parents do need to communicate with their children about various aspects of their lives, including family members. However, when those family members are in a romantic relationship with the parent, it's important to balance the child's needs with the partner's feelings. \n\nSo, the question is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend is inherently wrong. If the father is doing it to ensure the son is okay with the new family dynamic, that's part of his role as a parent. But if the girlfriend perceives it as a setup to criticize her, then the father might not have communicated his intentions clearly. \n\nIn the absence of more context about how the conversation went, it's tricky. But based on the info given, the father's intent was to check in with his son, not to undermine the girlfriend. However, the effect was that the girlfriend felt undermined. So, maybe the father didn't consider how it would make her feel, even if that wasn't his intent. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he didn't intend to undermine her but failed to consider her perspective, he might be partially at fault. But if the act itself is a reasonable parental action, then maybe not. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid if she felt criticized. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the conversation was done in a respectful and neutral manner. If the father approached it as a parent concerned for his child's well-being and not as a way to evaluate the girlfriend's performance, then he's not in the wrong. But if the way he approached it made the girlfriend feel judged, then maybe he's partially at fault. \n\nGiven the information available, the father's action seems reasonable as part of his role as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction is a problem, but the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to know how his child feels.\n"
