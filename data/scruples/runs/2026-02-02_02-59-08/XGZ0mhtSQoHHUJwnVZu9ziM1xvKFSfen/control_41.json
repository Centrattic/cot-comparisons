My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has two sons, ages 8 and 14, and lives with his girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to help with the kids a few days a week, which led to conflict. The girlfriend called him an asshole. The author then had a conversation with his oldest son (14) to check in on how the kids are feeling about the situation, especially regarding his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and felt undermined, leading her to leave the house and consider the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author's intention was to ensure his son isn't being negatively affected by the situation. As a parent, it's important to check in with children about their well-being, especially when there are changes in family dynamics. The father did not disclose his motivations clearly, perhaps leading to the girlfriend's misunderstanding. However, the act of talking to his own child about his living situation and relationships isn't inherently wrong. Parents have a right to discuss family matters with their children.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned or that the father isn't supporting her. If the conversation wasn't framed properly, it could be seen as a lack of trust. The father might not have considered how the conversation could be perceived by the girlfriend, especially if it wasn't a neutral discussion. The girlfriend's emotional response is significant, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father is wrong. The core issue is communication. If the father had discussed his concerns with his girlfriend before talking to the son, it might have avoided the conflict. However, the father's action was to protect his child's well-being, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the father's approach could have been more considerate in communication.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on intent and communication. The father had a valid reason to talk to his son. The problem arises if the conversation wasn't conducted in a way that respected the girlfriend's position. However, since the father is the parent, he has a right to discuss family matters with his children. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme given that the father is fulfilling his parental responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could have handled the communication better. So, answer B.\n"
