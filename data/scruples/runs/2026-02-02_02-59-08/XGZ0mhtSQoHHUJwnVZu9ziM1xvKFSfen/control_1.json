My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a dad living with his girlfriend and his two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She got angry and called him an asshole. Then, after getting advice from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son about his feelings regarding the situation\u2014his mother being away, living with the girlfriend, and his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo the key points here are: the dad wanted to check in with his son about how he's feeling, which is a reasonable parental concern. The girlfriend took offense because he discussed her with the child without her knowledge, feeling it undermines her. The author argues that he needs to be able to talk to his kids without permission from his girlfriend, and the conversation wasn't just about her but also about his ex-wife.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In terms of parenting, talking to your child about how they feel in their environment is generally considered a good thing. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their children's well-being, which includes understanding their perspectives. The author's action was to protect his child's emotional health, which is a valid reason. However, the way he approached it might have been a factor. Did he discuss the girlfriend in a critical way? The post says the conversation was as much about the mother's trip as the girlfriend, so maybe it wasn't entirely negative. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling betrayed and undermined. If the dad had discussed the girlfriend in a negative light with the child, that would be different. But the dad's intention was to ensure the child's well-being, not to criticize the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly projecting her own insecurities. However, the dad might have failed to consider the girlfriend's feelings in involving the child in such a discussion. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The dad could have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend first, maybe to align on how to approach the child's feelings. But the dad's argument is that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing permission. Children's well-being often takes precedence in such situations. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author's actions seem justified from a parenting perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is possibly an overreaction, especially if the conversation was neutral or aimed at understanding the child's feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
