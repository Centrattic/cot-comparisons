My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author, a man in his 40s, lives with his girlfriend and two sons. He had asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school, which she didn't like, leading to a conflict. Now, he's talking to his oldest son about how the son perceives his girlfriend and the current situation, including his mother being away. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, saying he undermined her and feeling betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was wrong. The author's intention was to check in on his child's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the way he did it might have been problematic. The girlfriend lost her job and the author is supporting her, so maybe she's under stress. He asked her to take on a specific responsibility (picking up the kids), which she resented, leading to the initial conflict. Then, he discussed this with his son without her knowledge, which she saw as a betrayal.\n\nThe key points to consider: 1) Did the author have a valid reason to talk to his son? 2) Was there a way to approach this without making the girlfriend feel undermined? 3) The girlfriend's reaction\u2014was it disproportionate?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without permission. But when discussing a partner, especially in the context of a conflict, it's possible that the child's perception is influenced by how the parent approaches the conversation. If the son is 14, he's old enough to understand complex emotions, but bringing up the girlfriend in that context without considering the girlfriend's feelings might have been a misstep.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, comparing the situation to high school drama. She might feel that the author is not trusting her or that he's involving the child in their relationship issues, which can be harmful. In co-parenting situations, especially with a new partner, maintaining boundaries and open communication is crucial. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before discussing her with the son, which could be seen as a lack of respect for her in the relationship. Even if his intent was to check on the child, the method might have been poor. He should have considered how his actions might affect his relationship with the girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned about the child's well-being, which is understandable. The comments from Reddit users might highlight that the child could sense the girlfriend's discomfort, so addressing that makes sense. But the timing and context of the conversation with the son might have been sensitive. The author didn't mention if he was neutral in his discussion or if he might have influenced the son's perception. If the conversation was framed in a way that questioned the girlfriend's role or caused the son to doubt her commitment, that's an issue.\n\nSo, the author's intention was good, but the action might have been poorly handled. The girlfriend's feelings of being undermined are valid if the son was led to question her. The author should have communicated his concerns with the girlfriend first and perhaps addressed the child's well-being together. By not doing so, he might have contributed to the girlfriend feeling disrespected. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because of the way the conversation was approached, even if the intent was to support the child.\n"
