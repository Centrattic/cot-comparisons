My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves talking to their son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset, thinking the author undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has two kids with his ex-wife, and he's now living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids a few times, which led to a conflict. Then, the author talked to his older son about his feelings regarding the situation, including his mother being away and his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got extremely upset, accusing the author of undermining her and lacking confidence in her. \n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son. Parents often have the right to discuss family matters with their children, especially regarding their well-being. However, the context here includes the girlfriend feeling targeted. The author's intention was to understand his son's feelings, not to criticize the girlfriend. But the way it was done might have caused offense. \n\nWas there a breach of trust? The author didn't consult the girlfriend beforehand, but discussing children's feelings is part of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction seems intense. Maybe there's a communication issue between the author and his girlfriend. The author might not be wrong for wanting to check in with his son, but perhaps he should have considered how the girlfriend would feel. Still, the author's main duty is to his children. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be a sign of insecurity or miscommunication. The author is an adult and has the right to parent his children without constant approval from his girlfriend. However, maybe there's a way to approach such conversations more sensitively. But the core issue is the son's well-being. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is probably not in the wrong. He's acting in his son's best interest. The girlfriend's overreaction is a red flag, but that's her issue. The author isn't wrong for communicating with his child about family dynamics. So the answer is B.\n"
