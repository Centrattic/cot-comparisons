My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a dad living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author is supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few times a week, which she reacted negatively to, calling him an asshole. Then he talks to his oldest son (14) about how the kid perceives the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wanted to check how the kids are doing with the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that he doesn't have confidence in her and that he betrayed her by discussing her with the child. \n\nSo, the key points here are: communicating with a child about a partner, the partner's reaction, and whether that communication was appropriate. \n\nI remember that in co-parenting or living with a partner, especially when there are children involved, communication is important. But there's also the aspect of trust and how partners perceive each other's actions. The author might think he's being responsible by checking in with his son, but the girlfriend feels that this conversation was a criticism of her. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with his son without her knowledge. The son is 14, so he's old enough to have such conversations, but the way it was handled might have been sensitive. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or not trusted. \n\nIn relationships, especially when there are other adults involved, transparency is usually key. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend first, maybe they could have found a way to address any concerns about the kids' well-being without making her feel targeted. However, the author might not have intended to undermine her; he might have genuinely wanted to ensure the kids are okay. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship. That's a significant response. It's possible she felt that even if the conversation was well-intentioned, it was done without her input and could have made the kids doubt her role or capabilities. \n\nThe author also mentions that the conversation was about his son's mother's trip and the girlfriend. Maybe he was trying to get the son's perspective on both situations, but the way he brought up the girlfriend could have been perceived as a negative comparison. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, parents should be able to talk to their kids about family dynamics. On the other hand, involving a partner's input without their knowledge can be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's feelings about being undermined might be valid if the conversation made her feel untrusted. \n\nThe author's defense is that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without permission. However, in a relationship, especially when cohabiting, some level of mutual respect and communication is expected. If he had approached it differently, maybe explaining his intentions to his girlfriend first, the outcome might have been different. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's possible the author overstepped by not discussing this with his girlfriend beforehand, even if the intent was good. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that her feelings of being respected were important here. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of a parent's right to talk to their child. \n\nHmm. I think the key is whether the conversation was meant to critique the girlfriend without her knowledge. If the author was just checking in with his son about how he feels about the new person in his life, that's part of parenting. However, if the way he asked or the context made it seem like he was doubting the girlfriend's ability or presence, that's where the issue is. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child is a critique, especially if the child is old enough to understand nuances. The author might not see it that way, but the girlfriend's perception is valid. So, maybe the author should have had that conversation in a way that wasn't perceived as undermining her, or discussed it with her first. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the girlfriend's feelings and the potential impact of the conversation on their relationship, the author might have misstepped. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Some might argue that parents need to check in with their kids, but the method here might have been the problem.\n"
