My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by talking to his son about how he perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has a girlfriend who recently lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids from school. The girlfriend was upset and called him an asshole. Then the author sat down with his 8-year-old and 14-year-old sons to talk about their feelings towards the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his kids about his girlfriend. Let's break it down. As a parent, it's important to check in with your children about their feelings, especially when there are significant changes in their family dynamics, like a new partner moving in or a parent being away. The author mentions that he wanted to ensure his children weren't being negatively affected by the girlfriend's behavior, as suggested by the Reddit comments. That seems like a responsible action.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend feels that the conversation was a betrayal. The key here is whether the author's conversation was appropriate. The author states that the conversation was part of discussing both the mother's absence and the girlfriend's presence. It's possible that the girlfriend feels her authority or role as a step-parent is being questioned. But as a parent, you have the right to talk to your children about family matters. It's important for the children's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the girlfriend's feelings or communicated better. But the act of talking to his own kids about their perceptions isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be an overreaction, especially if she's aware that the author is trying to protect his kids. The author isn't trying to undermine her; he's addressing the children's well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
