My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by talking to his son about his girlfriend. The original situation is that the girlfriend got upset when she found out he discussed her with their son.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that he wanted to check in with his son to make sure he's adjusting well, especially since the mom is away and the new girlfriend is part of the household. The son was happy, so the author felt reassured. The problem arose when the girlfriend found out and took offense, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so it's reasonable for him to have open conversations with his children about family dynamics. The son is 8 and 14, so the older one is more likely to understand the conversation. The author didn't mention any specific negative things about the girlfriend; he was just asking the son's opinion. The girlfriend's reaction seems pretty intense. She left the house and said the author was a 6-year-old, which is a strong response. \n\nBut why did she react that way? Maybe she felt insecure or that the author didn't trust her. The author's girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author is supporting her. Maybe she's feeling vulnerable and the conversation made her feel like the author is questioning her role in the family. However, the author is justified in wanting to ensure his children are okay with the living situation. Parents should be able to talk to their kids about family matters without it being a big issue with a partner.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have a right to keep this conversation private? Since the son is his child, the author should have the right to discuss matters concerning the family without needing permission from a girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling dismissed or not trusted, but the author's action was in the interest of his children's well-being.\n\nThe key points are whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son and if the girlfriend's reaction is disproportionate. The author didn't do anything malicious; he was checking in on his kids. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be her own insecurity, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's acting as a responsible parent, and the girlfriend's reaction seems unwarranted.\n"
