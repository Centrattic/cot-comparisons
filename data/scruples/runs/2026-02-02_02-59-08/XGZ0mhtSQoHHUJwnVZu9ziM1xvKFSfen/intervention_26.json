My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a father talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The father's girlfriend is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father had a previous issue where his girlfriend was supposed to take care of the kids, but she was unhappy about it. Then he decided to talk to his son to check how the kids are feeling about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend is now upset because he discussed her with the son.\n\nSo, the key points here: The father's intention was to ensure his kids are okay, especially since there was prior tension. But the girlfriend feels her authority or position is being questioned. The question is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to know how the kids are feeling, especially when there's a new caregiver involved. However, the way he approached it might have been problematic. Did he talk to the son alone, without informing the girlfriend? That could be an issue because involving the kids in adult relationships can be tricky. Also, if the girlfriend felt that her boundaries were crossed, even if the father had good intentions, it's a valid concern. \n\nBut the father argues that he's an adult and needs to be able to talk to his kids without prior approval. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she feels disrespected. It's a balance between a parent's duty to their children and respecting the partner's feelings.\n\nIn many cases, communication between partners is crucial. If the father had discussed his concerns with the girlfriend first, maybe they could have found a way to approach the kids together. Instead, he went directly to the son, which might have made her feel that her role as a caregiver was being questioned without her input.\n\nSo, while the father's intention was to check on his kids' well-being, the method might have been flawed. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel that discussing her with the son without her knowledge undermines the relationship dynamics. Therefore, the father might have been inconsiderate of her feelings, even if his intentions were good. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend first before discussing her with the son, which led to her feeling betrayed. The answer is A.\n"
