My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the details.\n\nThe author is a dad who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the dad has been supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week and watch them, but she called him an asshole. Then, the author read the Reddit comments from the previous post and was told that the kids might be sensing the girlfriend's lack of desire to be there. So he sat down with his oldest son to talk about how he feels about his mother, living with his dad, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and that he has no confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend and is rethinking the relationship.\n\nThe author argues that he needed to talk to his son about these things, especially since the kid's mom is away, and he's the parent. He didn't mean to undermine the girlfriend, and the conversation was about multiple things, not just her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to check in with his son about his well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. However, the way the author went about it might have been problematic. The previous situation where the girlfriend was asked to take care of the kids and called him an asshole might have set up some tension. The author then, after hearing concerns from Reddit, decided to talk to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The girlfriend felt undermined, which could be because the author didn't consult her first. But the author is the parent, and talking to his children is part of his role. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have been more considerate in how he brought up the topic, especially considering the girlfriend's feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is very harsh\u2014calling it a betrayal and needing to rethink the relationship. That seems disproportionate. The author is trying to ensure the child's well-being, which is a parent's duty. \n\nThe key points are: the parent's right to discuss their child's well-being, the girlfriend's right to feel respected, and whether the conversation was necessary. The author did not mention any specific issues with the girlfriend's care, just checking in. The girlfriend's anger seems to stem from feeling criticized indirectly through the child. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He might have approached the conversation in a way that could be seen as questioning the girlfriend's role without addressing her directly first. But as a parent, he has the right to talk to his child about their feelings and environment. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, possibly because she's sensitive about her role, especially after the previous conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have handled the conversation with more care, perhaps discussing the general well-being of the child without focusing on the girlfriend. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is due to her own stress from losing her job and the previous disagreement. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's intention was to check on his son's feelings, which is valid. The girlfriend's reaction is over the top. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong. However, the way he approached the conversation could be improved. But overall, the answer is probably B.\n"
