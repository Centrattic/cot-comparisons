My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nSo, the main points are: the father (44M) lives with his girlfriend (32F) and two kids, 8 and 14. The girlfriend lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. In the previous Reddit post, people mentioned that the kids might sense her reluctance. The father then talked to his oldest son (14-year-old) about how he feels about the situation, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed, saying he lacks confidence in her. She left the house to stay with friends and wants to rethink the relationship. The father feels he's just being a parent and needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break it down. The key issue here is the dad's conversation with his son about the girlfriend. The dad's intention was to understand the child's feelings and ensure he's not harming the kids, which seems reasonable. However, the girlfriend perceived this as undermining her, which is a big deal in their relationship. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important to know the kids' feelings and well-being. The dad is acting in the kids' best interest. However, he might have failed to consider how his actions would affect the girlfriend. The girlfriend might feel that her role as a caregiver is being questioned, especially since she's already under stress from losing her job. The dad didn't consult her before talking to the kid, which could be a breach of trust from her perspective.\n\nBut, the dad isn't the kid's parent, so he has a responsibility to his children's well-being. The conversation was about the kids' feelings, not a direct criticism of the girlfriend. The father's argument is that he needs to talk to his kids without needing permission, which makes sense in terms of parental autonomy. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel disrespected or not trusted.\n\nThe crux here is the communication between the parents. The dad didn't discuss this with his girlfriend first, which could have prevented the conflict. In a relationship, transparency is important. If the dad was concerned about the kids' feelings, maybe he should have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend before talking to the child, especially if the child might mention the girlfriend's role.\n\nBut on the other hand, the dad's main responsibility is his children. He can't always check with his partner before discussing their feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but her feelings of being undermined are real. It's a balancing act between parental duties and maintaining a healthy relationship with a partner.\n\nSo, is the dad in the wrong? If he acted out of concern for his child and didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend, but didn't communicate his intent, maybe there's room for both sides. However, the dad did talk to the child about the girlfriend's role without her knowing. If the girlfriend felt her role was being questioned, that's a valid concern. But the dad's action was to check on the child's well-being, which is his responsibility. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the dad's action was appropriate communication. Since the dad was concerned about the child's perception and the previous feedback from Reddit mentioned the kids might sense the girlfriend's reluctance, his action was proactive. But he didn't coordinate with his girlfriend, leading to her feeling betrayed. \n\nIn some cases, discussing a partner's role in front of the child could affect the child's perception. However, the dad was just gathering information. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but maybe she's sensitive due to her job loss. The dad is not in the wrong because he's doing his duty as a parent, but he could have handled it better by communicating with his girlfriend first. Since the question is whether he's the asshole, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, if the dad discussed the girlfriend's role in the conversation, maybe he overstepped. However, he mentioned the conversation was as much about the mother's trip as the girlfriend. So the focus wasn't solely on the girlfriend. \n\nI think the key is that the dad had a legitimate reason to talk to his son about how he's feeling, including his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction is her own issue, but the dad isn't wrong for wanting to check in with his child. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
