My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation involves a man living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then he talked to his oldest son about how he perceives the girlfriend and his mom.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend was wrong. The author argues that he needed to check in with his son about how the kids are feeling, especially since previous comments suggested the girlfriend might not be fully engaged. He mentions they discussed both the girlfriend and his ex-wife. Now the girlfriend is upset, feeling undermined and that he has no confidence in her. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of a parent. Parents should be able to talk to their kids about family dynamics, especially when it affects the children. However, the way the conversation was approached might matter. The author didn't clear it with the girlfriend, which might have been a mistake. But is that necessarily wrong?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She's upset about being discussed without her consent. But in many cases, parents do talk to their children about other adults in their lives without prior approval. However, if the conversation was critical or could affect the child's perception of the girlfriend, that might be different. The author says he just wanted to know how the son felt, which is reasonable. The son was happy with the current situation, so maybe the conversation was positive.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child in her absence could affect the child's view of her, even if it was just to assess his feelings. It's possible that the author didn't explain the conversation to her first, which could have caused unnecessary hurt. But the author also has a right to ensure his children's well-being and that their adjustment to the new living situation is going smoothly.\n\nThe key points are: Was the conversation necessary? Yes, for the children's well-being. Did the author have a right to talk to his son? Yes, as a parent. However, perhaps he should have discussed this with the girlfriend beforehand to avoid misunderstanding. But in some situations, parents might not need to get permission from a partner to talk to their kids about family matters. The girlfriend's reaction being extreme could indicate her insecurity or feeling threatened, which is not the author's fault.\n\nSo, the author's actions were in the best interest of his children. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, is her own issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to check on his son's feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
