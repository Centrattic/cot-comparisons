My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two kids, lives with his girlfriend, and she recently lost her job. He asked her to pick up the kids sometimes, which led to an argument. Then he talked to his oldest son about how the son feels about the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author is now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents usually need to talk to their kids about family dynamics, especially when there are changes like a new partner involved. The author's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which seems reasonable. He didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend but to ensure the kids are adjusting well. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend felt betrayed. So, there's a conflict between the parent's duty to his children and the girlfriend's feelings. The parent might have a right to talk to his kids about their well-being, but maybe he should have considered the girlfriend's feelings first? However, the kids are his responsibility, and the girlfriend is a partner, not a parent. \n\nAnother angle: when the parent talks to his child about the girlfriend, does that imply a lack of trust or confidence in her? The girlfriend might feel it's a criticism, but the parent's intention was to assess the child's adjustment. The parent might not be in the wrong if the conversation was for the child's benefit. However, maybe the way he approached it without discussing it with the girlfriend first was a misstep. \n\nBut the parent is an adult, and talking to his kids is part of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive, but maybe the parent could have been more careful in how he discussed the girlfriend to avoid making her feel undermined. However, the parent's main goal was the child's welfare, which should take precedence. \n\nSo, the author probably isn't in the wrong (B) because checking in with his son about family dynamics is a responsible parent action. The girlfriend's reaction is a matter of communication and relationship dynamics, but the parent's action itself wasn't wrong. There might be room for better communication, but the act of talking to the child isn't inherently wrong.\n"
