My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father talking to his son about his girlfriend, which then caused a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The father lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which she didn't like. Then he had a conversation with his 14-year-old son about how the son perceives the girlfriend and the mother being away. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong for talking to his son. Let's break it down. Parents usually have the right to talk to their kids about family dynamics. The father says the conversation was about both the mother (who is away) and the girlfriend, and it was to understand the child's perspective. He didn't do it to undermine the girlfriend but to check in on his son's well-being.\n\nHowever, some might argue that discussing the girlfriend in front of the children could affect the child's perception or create loyalty issues. But the father is also an adult, and discussing his relationship with his girlfriend in the context of his children's feelings isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially since he's a parent and needs to talk to his kids about their lives.\n\nThe key points are: the father's intent was to check on his son's well-being, the conversation wasn't meant to undermine the girlfriend, and he's an adult who shouldn't need permission to talk to his children. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or disrespected, but that doesn't make the father wrong for having the conversation. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
