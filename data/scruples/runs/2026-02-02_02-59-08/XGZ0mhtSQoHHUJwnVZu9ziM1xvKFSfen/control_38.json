My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to conflict. Then he sat down with his oldest son to discuss how he views the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, considering previous feedback from Reddit that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. The author didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend but to ensure his children's emotional state. However, the girlfriend took it as a betrayal and left.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, parents have a right to talk to their children about family dynamics to understand their feelings. On the other hand, discussing a partner in front of the child might make the partner feel disrespected, depending on how it's done.\n\nThe author didn't tell the son negative things about the girlfriend; instead, he asked the son about his perceptions, including both his mother's absence and the girlfriend. The author's main concern was his son's adjustment. However, the girlfriend's reaction is intense, feeling that her relationship is being doubted. \n\nIn co-parenting situations, communication is crucial. The author might have failed to discuss this conversation with his girlfriend beforehand, leading to her feeling blindsided. Even if the intent was good, not considering the girlfriend's perspective could be a misstep. But is that being in the wrong? Or is it about poor communication?\n\nIn many cases, talking to children about family members is normal, but when it involves a new partner, it might be sensitive. The line between parental duty and respecting a partner's feelings can be thin. The author's action could be seen as necessary for the child's well-being, but the way it was done without prior discussion might have caused unnecessary hurt.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the answer is based solely on intent and the necessity of checking on his son, then maybe not. But if the wrong comes from not discussing it with his girlfriend first, then there's a communication issue. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are intent vs. impact. The author intended to ensure his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling undermined, but the author didn't do it maliciously. \n\nIn such cases, the answer often leans towards the parent not being in the wrong because children need to feel they can talk freely to their parents. However, the way it's done matters. If the parent had a good reason and the conversation was balanced, then it's justified. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong.\n"
