My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author lives with his girlfriend and their two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to help with the kids a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Then, after some Reddit comments made him realize his kids might be affected, he talked to his oldest son (14 years old) about his feelings regarding his mom being away and his perception of the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend was wrong. The author argues that he needed to check in on his child's well-being, especially since the girlfriend is now in a parental role. The girlfriend feels that he's not supporting her and is undermining her by discussing her in front of the child.\n\nFrom a parenting perspective, it's important to involve children in conversations about their lives, especially when there are changes. The author's intention was to ensure his son was okay with the new family dynamics, which seems responsible. However, the way he approached it might have been problematic. Discussing the girlfriend in front of the child could make the child feel like he's being used as a third party in a relationship conflict, which might not be healthy. Additionally, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected, which could indicate that the author didn't consider her feelings, even if his intent was good.\n\nBut then, as a parent, he has the right to talk to his children about their lives and the people in them. The key is whether he did it in a way that respected both his son and his girlfriend. If the conversation was meant to support his son and not to criticize the girlfriend, then maybe it's valid. However, if the son shared negative feelings about the girlfriend, that could damage the relationship between the girlfriend and the child, which is a concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also intense. She left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship, calling him immature. That suggests she felt a breach of trust. In a relationship, communication is important. Maybe the author should have discussed with his girlfriend first about talking to the son, especially since the girlfriend is part of the family now. However, the son is his legal child, so the parent has the right to discuss family matters with them regardless of the partner's feelings.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the parent's duty to his children is primary. On the other, involving a partner in family dynamics requires mutual respect. The author's action might be seen as necessary for his son's well-being, but the lack of communication with his girlfriend could have caused unnecessary hurt. But is that his fault? If he's doing what's right for his child, maybe he's not at fault. However, the way he handled it without considering his partner's perspective might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because as a parent, the author has the right to talk to his children about their lives and the people around them. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author's intent was to ensure his son's well-being. However, there's a balance. He might not be in the wrong, but could have handled it differently. But according to the question, the main thing is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he was checking on his child's feelings, it's more about his parental duty, so B might be the right choice.\n"
