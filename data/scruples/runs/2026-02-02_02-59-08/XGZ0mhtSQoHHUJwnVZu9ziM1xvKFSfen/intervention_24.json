My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then he talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the mom and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and had a big reaction, saying he undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' responsibilities. As a parent, he should be involved in his children's lives and check in on their well-being. Talking to his son about how he feels about the family situation might be necessary for the child's emotional health. But the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or position in the home.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author argues that he needed to talk to his son about the family dynamics, including the girlfriend, and that he's an adult who should be able to have these conversations without permission. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels betrayed and not respected.\n\nKey points: The parent's duty to his children's well-being vs. the girlfriend's feelings about being discussed without her knowledge. Was there a breach of trust? Did the author communicate with the girlfriend beforehand? It seems like he didn't, which might be an issue. However, as a parent, he has a right to discuss his children's lives with them. The problem might be how the conversation was framed. If the author was critical of the girlfriend in front of the child, that could be damaging. But the author says the conversation was about the mother's absence and the girlfriend equally. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid. Maybe the author should have discussed the conversation with her first, especially since the son is quite young (8 and 14, so the oldest is 14). At 14, a child might be old enough to have such a conversation, but the parents' approach matters. If the author didn't go into the discussion with the intention to undermine the girlfriend, but rather to understand the child's perspective, then maybe it's justified. However, the girlfriend's perception is that he didn't have confidence in her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author is the parent, his primary responsibility is to his children. If the conversation was to ensure the child's emotional state, then he's doing his duty. However, the way it was handled could have been better, maybe with some prior communication with the girlfriend. But he didn't mention doing that, so maybe he's at fault for not being considerate of her feelings. However, the core issue is the child's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics. If the author is in the wrong, it's because he didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings. But if he's not, because as a parent he needs to prioritize his child. The user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. \n\nGiven that the author's intent was to check on his son's feelings, which is a parent's responsibility, and the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling undermined, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. However, the method could have been better. But technically, parents do have the right to discuss family matters with their children. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
