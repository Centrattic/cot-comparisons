My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user (a man in his 40s) has two kids and a girlfriend. He asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school, but she got really upset and called him an asshole. Then he talked to his son about how the son felt about the girlfriend and the situation with his mom. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's actions. He had a conversation with his son to check in on how the kids are coping, especially since the mom (his ex?) is away and he's living with a new girlfriend. That seems like a reasonable concern as a parent. He mentions his son was happy, so maybe the conversation was just to ensure the kids were okay.\n\nBut the girlfriend is upset because he talked to the son about her. She feels it undermines her. The question is whether the user overstepped or not. As a parent, you do have the right to talk to your children about various aspects of their lives, including people in the household. However, if the conversation was perceived as critical of the girlfriend, that could be an issue.\n\nThe user says the conversation was as much about the son's mother's trip as about the girlfriend. So maybe he was trying to balance both. But the girlfriend took it as a personal attack. The user didn't consult her before talking to the kid, which could be a problem in terms of communication within the relationship. However, the user's primary responsibility is to his children's well-being.\n\nIn many cases, parents need to discuss with their kids about different family dynamics, including new partners. If the girlfriend is a significant part of the child's life, especially living in the same house, the child's feelings about her are relevant. The user might not be wrong in wanting to check in on his son's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user should have discussed this with his girlfriend first, considering she's an adult and part of the household. But the user argues that he can't have to clear every conversation with her. There's a balance between respecting her feelings and the parent's duty to the children.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid if she felt targeted. The user's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, which is a parent's role. However, the way the conversation was handled might have been a misunderstanding. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the user isn't in the wrong because the conversation was about the children's well-being, not a personal attack on the girlfriend.\n"
