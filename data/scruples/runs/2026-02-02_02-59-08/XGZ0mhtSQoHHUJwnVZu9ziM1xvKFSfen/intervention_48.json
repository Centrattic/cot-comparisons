My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to their son about how he perceives the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then he sat down with his 14-year-old son to talk about how he feels about the situation, including his mother (the ex?) being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nLet's break it down. The parent has a responsibility to check in with his kids, especially about their well-being and how they're adjusting to family changes. The son is 14, so a teenager, and it's reasonable for a parent to discuss these things. The conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mother being away. The parent's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also important. She might feel that discussing her in front of the son without her knowledge could undermine her authority or make the son question her role. It's possible that the parent didn't consider how the girlfriend would perceive the conversation. But is the parent wrong for discussing his children's feelings with them? Probably not. Parents should communicate openly with their kids. \n\nThe key here is intent versus perception. The parent's intent was good\u2014to check on the kids. The girlfriend's perception is that she was undermined. But does a parent need to consult their partner before talking to their kids? That's debatable. In a co-parenting or blended family situation, communication between adults is important. However, the parent isn't required to clear every conversation with the girlfriend before talking to his own children. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the parent could have approached the conversation differently. Maybe discussing it with the girlfriend first or framing it in a way that doesn't single out the girlfriend. However, the main issue is whether the parent was wrong. Since the parent had a valid reason to talk to his son about the family dynamics, and as long as the conversation was age-appropriate and focused on the child's well-being, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (no, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent has a duty to check in with his children about their feelings and circumstances. The girlfriend's reaction is more about feeling undermined, but the parent's actions were aimed at ensuring the kids' well-being.\n"
