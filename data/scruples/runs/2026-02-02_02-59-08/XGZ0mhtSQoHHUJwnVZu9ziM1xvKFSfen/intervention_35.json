My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a dad, talked to his son about how the son feels about his mom being away, living with his dad, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because he needed to talk to his kids without checking with his girlfriend first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent-child relationship. Parents often talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including family dynamics. But the girlfriend might feel that being discussed behind her back, even if it's about the kids' feelings, is a breach of trust. The author's intention was to understand his son's perspective, which is a valid parental concern. However, the way it was done might have been problematic. Did he talk to the son in a way that was critical of the girlfriend, or was it neutral? The author says the conversation was as much about the son's mother's trip as about the girlfriend. But maybe the girlfriend felt targeted regardless.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's reaction. She took it as a personal attack and left the house. That's a strong reaction. Maybe there's a history of tension or lack of communication between the author and his girlfriend. If the author didn't consult her before discussing her with the son, even if it was about the kids, she might feel disrespected. But isn't the parent's right to discuss their children's well-being with them a key part of parenting? The line here is blurry. \n\nOn one hand, the author is doing his job as a parent by checking in with his child. On the other hand, discussing a partner in a way that could be seen as judgmental might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's feeling of being undermined is real, even if unintended. The question is whether the author should have considered her feelings first. Maybe there's a better way to approach such conversations to avoid hurting others, especially in a co-parenting or cohabitating situation.\n\nThe author argues that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without permission. That's true, but in a relationship, communication and mutual respect matter. If the girlfriend feels betrayed, there might be underlying issues that the author isn't seeing. It's possible that the author is in the right because he's acting in his children's best interest, but it's also possible that he could have handled it more sensitively to preserve the relationship with his girlfriend.\n\nI think the key here is the intent versus the impact. The author's intent was good\u2014to understand his son's feelings. The impact was that his girlfriend felt disrespected. So, maybe the author isn't the asshole, but he could have handled it differently. However, if the conversation was neutral and the girlfriend is overreacting, then he's not wrong. But if the conversation was perceived as critical, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the details again: the author says the conversation was just as much about the mother's trip as the girlfriend. So maybe it's balanced. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme. But in relationships, especially when co-parenting, even neutral discussions can be perceived negatively if there's existing tension. The author might have a point, but he could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the action was necessary for the kids and done without malice, maybe he's not. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because parents should be able to discuss their children's well-being without needing permission from a partner. But if the way he approached the conversation was critical or led to undermining her, then A. The story doesn't specify that he was harsh, so maybe B is the answer.\n"
