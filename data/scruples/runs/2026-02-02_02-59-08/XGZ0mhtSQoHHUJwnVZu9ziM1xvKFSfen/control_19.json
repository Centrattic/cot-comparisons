My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who talked to their son about how the son perceives the girlfriend is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father with two kids and a girlfriend. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, after advice from Reddit, he talked to his 14-year-old son about how he feels about the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and is furious, saying he undermined her and doesn't trust her. Now she's considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the main question is: was it wrong for the dad to talk to his son about the girlfriend? Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, as a parent, you need to be aware of how your children feel about their living situation and caregivers. The dad was concerned that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, so he wanted to check in with his oldest son. That seems like a legitimate parental concern. The son was happy, which is good. The dad's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, not to undermine the girlfriend. He also mentioned that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about the mom being away. So maybe the girlfriend is taking it personally.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the dad is not trusting her. If he didn't discuss it with her first, she might perceive it as a lack of confidence in her ability to parent or be there for the kids. However, the father has a duty to his children's well-being, and talking to them directly is part of that responsibility. It's reasonable for a parent to discuss such matters with their kids without needing permission from a partner. The girlfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top. \n\nBut maybe there's more context. Did the dad approach the conversation in a way that made the girlfriend feel disrespected? The way the conversation was framed might matter. If he asked the son critical questions about the girlfriend, that could be an issue. However, the dad's intention was to check in with the kid, not to criticize the girlfriend. The son had positive things to say, which the dad was relieved about. \n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. Maybe the dad should have discussed his concerns with the girlfriend first, but the primary responsibility to his children's emotional state is his as a parent. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role isn't being supported, but the dad isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his kids are okay. \n\nI think the key here is intent versus impact. The dad's intent was to check on his son's well-being, which is appropriate. The impact upset the girlfriend, but that doesn't necessarily make the dad wrong. It's a situation where both parties need to communicate better. The dad isn't the asshole for wanting to know how his child feels about the household dynamics. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
