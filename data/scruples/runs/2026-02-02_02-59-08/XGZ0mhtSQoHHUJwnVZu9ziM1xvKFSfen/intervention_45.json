My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author in this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details. The author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend (32F) and his two sons, 8 and 14. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week and watch them. She got upset and called him an asshole in a previous post. Now, after getting feedback from Reddit about the kids possibly sensing her reluctance, the author had a conversation with his oldest son (14) about how the son perceives the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out, got extremely angry, accused him of undermining her and not having confidence in her, and left to stay with a friend, saying she needs to rethink the relationship. The author is now wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main concern was for his children's well-being, thinking they might be picking up on the girlfriend's negative feelings from before. He approached the son directly to discuss this, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend felt that this conversation was an attack on her, leading to conflict. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to talk to his son about his girlfriend without discussing it with her first? The author's intention was to check on the child's perspective, not to criticize the girlfriend. The son was happy with the current situation, so the author might have been trying to address any potential issues. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She might feel that discussing her in the presence of the child, even if it's about the child's own feelings, is a breach of trust. In relationships, especially with someone not the child's parent, there can be sensitivity around being discussed with the child without prior agreement. The author didn't consult her first, which could be seen as a lack of respect for her feelings. \n\nThe author argues that as a parent, he needs to talk to his kids without prior approval from his partner. That's a valid point. Parents should have autonomy in discussing family matters with their children. However, the method might be where the problem lies. If he had included the girlfriend in the conversation or at least discussed it with her first, maybe her reaction would have been different. \n\nBut the situation is complex. The author's primary role is as a parent, and it's important for him to be able to talk to his children about their home life. The girlfriend's feelings might stem from insecurity or a need for validation. The fact that the son was happy with the current arrangement suggests that the author's intention was good. \n\nStill, the girlfriend's perspective is that he undermined her. Even if unintentional, bringing up her role in front of the child without her consent could be perceived as him not supporting her. It's possible that the author didn't realize how sensitive the situation was for the girlfriend. \n\nIn this case, the author's action was to check in with his child about his well-being, which is a parent's duty. However, the way he approached it might have been a misstep by not considering the girlfriend's feelings first. But he wasn't badmouthing her; he was just discussing the child's perception. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the relationship dynamics. If the author and his girlfriend have a history of trust issues, this could be a trigger. But the author's intent was to ensure the kids' emotional state, which is justified. The girlfriend's overreaction might be a result of her own feelings of insecurity or the existing stress from losing her job. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he was acting as a parent, but maybe there's a lesson in communication here. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't make him the asshole necessarily. He should have probably discussed it with her to avoid the conflict, but the necessity to talk to his child is a valid reason.\n"
