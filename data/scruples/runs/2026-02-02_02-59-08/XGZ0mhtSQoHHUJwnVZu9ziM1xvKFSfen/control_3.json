My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The man has two kids with an ex, and he's now living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some feedback on Reddit, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the girlfriend and his mother being away. The girlfriend found out and is now furious, saying he undermined her and doesn't trust her. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's right to talk to his child versus the girlfriend's feelings. As a parent, he has a responsibility to check in with his children's well-being, especially when there are changes in their living situation. The kid is 14, so old enough to have opinions. The parent didn't do this to undermine the girlfriend; he mentioned it was also about the ex's absence. \n\nHowever, maybe he could have approached it differently. Maybe discussing the girlfriend's role in front of the kid could make the kid feel caught in the middle or affect the girlfriend's relationship with the kids. But the parent's intention was to ensure the kids are okay, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially since they are adults and should handle such communication maturely. \n\nThe parent is not the one causing the issue here. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her insecurities rather than the parent's wrongdoing. So the answer would be B, not the author's fault.\n"
