My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. The older son was involved in a conversation where the author discussed his impressions of the girlfriend and their mother's absence. The girlfriend found out and got upset, thinking the author undermined her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent-child relationship. As a parent, talking to your child about family dynamics is generally acceptable, especially when it's about their well-being. The author mentions that he was concerned about the kids' feelings, which is a valid reason for such a conversation. The focus was on the child's perspective, not just the girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. The author didn't consult her, which might have been a point of contention. But the key here is intent. The author's intention was to understand his son's feelings, not to criticize the girlfriend. The girlfriend's insecurity might stem from other issues, like her job loss and the role she's taking on. \n\nIs the author wrong for not discussing the conversation with his girlfriend first? It depends on the relationship dynamics. But parents do have the right to talk to their children without needing permission from their partner. The conversation was about the child's emotions, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction seems exaggerated, especially since the author didn't go out of his way to undermine her. \n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole, considering he's trying to do what's best for his kids. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent's duty to communicate with his child about family matters is prioritized over the girlfriend's insecurities. The girlfriend's issues might be more about her own stress and not the conversation itself.\n"
