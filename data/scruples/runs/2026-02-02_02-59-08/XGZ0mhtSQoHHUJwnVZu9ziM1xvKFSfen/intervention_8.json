My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his perceptions of the girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has two sons, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job, and he had her pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset about that and called him an asshole. Then, after some Reddit advice, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the situation, including the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out, got angry, and left, saying he undermined her and lacked trust.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author believes he's just being a responsible parent, engaging with his child about his feelings. He's not directly criticizing the girlfriend but asking the son's opinion. The girlfriend feels betrayed that he didn't consult her before talking to the kid. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author might think it's normal to talk to his child about their opinions, especially about their other parent (the girlfriend). However, the girlfriend feels that discussing her with the child without her input is a breach of trust. \n\nLegally, if the kids were in a custody arrangement with their mother, the author might need to consider her input. But in this case, since the girlfriend is not the biological mother, but the kids' mother is away, the author is the primary caregiver. However, in terms of relationship dynamics, sharing concerns about the girlfriend with the child could make her feel disrespected. \n\nThe age of the child matters too. A 14-year-old might understand and express opinions, but discussing the girlfriend's role in the household could make her feel like she's being evaluated without her consent. The author might not have intended to undermine her, but from her perspective, it could seem like he's not supporting her.\n\nThe author argues that the conversation was also about the mother's trip, not just the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt targeted. In relationships, partners often expect a certain level of privacy and mutual respect. Even if the author's intention was good, not informing the girlfriend about discussing her with their child might be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the question is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend without her knowledge is wrong. It's a balance between parental responsibility and respecting the partner's feelings. If the author had discussed the concerns with the girlfriend first, maybe they could have found a way to address the child's feelings without making her feel undermined. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to understand his child's perspective, the method might have been tactless. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because being discussed in such a context without her input can feel hurtful. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings and not approaching the situation with more sensitivity.\n"
