My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author talked to their son about how the son perceives his mother and the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The parent wanted to check in with the child about their feelings, which is a reasonable concern. The parent mentions that the conversation was also about the child's other mother being away, not just the girlfriend. So, the intention was to understand the child's well-being, which seems valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt betrayed and undermined. The parent didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand. In a shared custody situation, communication between both parents and the child's other caregivers is important. However, the parent might have the right to discuss their children's feelings without prior approval, especially if the child is old enough to express his views.\n\nThe key points are: the parent's right to communicate with their child versus the girlfriend's feelings of being undermined. The parent's action was for the child's well-being, but the manner in which it was done might have been a misstep. The parent didn't consult the girlfriend first, which could be seen as a lack of cooperation, but the conversation itself seems necessary.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because talking to the child is part of being a responsible parent. However, maybe there's a lesson here about involving the girlfriend more in the child's life if they're co-parenting or living together. But the core of the issue is the parent's right to discuss their child's feelings, which isn't the same as the girlfriend being in the wrong. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
