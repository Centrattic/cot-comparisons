My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author (a man in a relationship with a woman, and a parent to two sons) had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, thinking he undermined her. The author is seeking advice on whether he's the asshole.\n\nSo, first, I need to break down the key points. The author wanted to check in with his son about how he's feeling since the mother is away and living with the author and his girlfriend. The author didn't realize the girlfriend would react this way. The girlfriend feels her position is being questioned, leading her to leave the house and reconsider the relationship. The author argues that he needed to talk to his son about family matters without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's important to maintain a good relationship with your children, so checking in on their well-being makes sense. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt her authority or position in the family was being undermined. The author didn't consult her before talking to the child, which might be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of support for his partner.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have thought it was a necessary conversation for the child's well-being, but not considering how the partner would perceive it could be a mistake. Even if the intention was good, the method might have been flawed. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author could have approached it differently, perhaps by involving her in the discussion or discussing the child's feelings together. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is a parent, and he has a responsibility to his children. He might not be in the wrong for wanting to ensure his child is okay. The problem might stem from not considering the girlfriend's feelings, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the asshole. \n\nBut if the author's action was a direct challenge to the girlfriend's role, then he might be in the wrong. The question is whether talking to the son about his perceptions of the girlfriend is a natural part of parenting or if it's crossing a line. Typically, parents should talk to their children about various aspects of their lives, including new family members. However, if the conversation was framed in a way that made the girlfriend feel criticized, that's a problem. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his children without his girlfriend's permission. That's a valid point, but the way it was done might have been insensitive. The girlfriend's feelings are important, and maybe the author could have handled it with more care, perhaps by preparing her for the conversation or discussing it afterward. \n\nIn summary, the author's intention was to check on his child's well-being, which is a valid reason. However, not considering how his actions would affect his girlfriend might be a misstep. It's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. The girlfriend's reaction is severe, but that doesn't mean the author had no part in it. Whether he's in the wrong might depend on the context of their relationship and past agreements. But from the information given, the author's action was necessary for his child's welfare, so he might not be in the wrong. However, the way he approached it could be seen as thoughtless. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because as a parent, he has the right to discuss family matters with his children. The girlfriend's upset is valid, but it's more about how they communicate moving forward rather than the author being the asshole.\n"
