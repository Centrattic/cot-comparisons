My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author (44M) lives with his girlfriend (32F) and two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to conflict. Now, he talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the situation, including his thoughts on the girlfriend and the mother. The girlfriend found out and is upset, thinking he undermined her and lacks confidence in her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about parental rights versus the girlfriend's feelings. The author argues that he should be able to talk to his children without needing permission. But the girlfriend feels betrayed and undermined. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's important to know how their kids are feeling, especially in a situation where the family dynamics are changing (like the girlfriend being a full-time presence). The author didn't talk to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the child's well-being. However, the way he approached it might have been perceived as a slight by the girlfriend, especially if she didn't get a chance to explain her side.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Legally and ethically, parents have the right to discuss their family's well-being with their children. The problem here is more about the girlfriend's reaction and how the conversation was handled. If the author had a legitimate concern for his son's feelings and the conversation was balanced (talking about the mother's trip and the girlfriend), then he might be justified. However, if the timing or the way he approached the conversation was insensitive, that could be an issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme given that it's about their children. But the author might have considered her feelings before bringing up her role in front of the child. Maybe a more collaborative approach with the girlfriend first would have been better, even if just to set the context. But the author's main duty is to his children, and ensuring they feel safe to express their feelings is important. The girlfriend's insecurity might be part of the problem here, but the author's intention was to check in with his son, which is a reasonable action. \n\nSo, while the author might not be in the wrong, there's room for improving communication with the girlfriend. But the core action\u2014talking to the child about his perceptions\u2014is a parent's responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
