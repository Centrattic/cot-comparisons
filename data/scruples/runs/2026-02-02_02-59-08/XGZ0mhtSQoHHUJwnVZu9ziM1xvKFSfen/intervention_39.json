My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author has two kids and a girlfriend they live with. The girlfriend lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids, which caused a conflict. The author then talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the new situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend took offense, feeling undermined.\n\nNow, the key points are: Is it wrong for a parent to talk to their child about how they feel about the new family member? Well, parents have a responsibility to check in with their kids' well-being. The author was concerned about the kids' adjustment, especially after previous feedback. Talking to the son about his mother's absence and the girlfriend is part of that responsibility. \n\nBut the girlfriend felt her authority was undermined. The author didn't intend to criticize the girlfriend but to discuss the child's feelings. However, the way it was handled might have been a miscommunication. The author didn't go into the conversation with negative intent, but maybe didn't consider the girlfriend's perspective enough. \n\nThe author did acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings but stands by the action as necessary for the child's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but it's possible the author didn't communicate his intent clearly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent has a right to discuss family matters with their children. However, maybe the author should have discussed this with the girlfriend first, considering her feelings in the relationship. But since the main concern was the child's adjustment, the action was in the child's best interest. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The author might have done the right thing by checking in with the child, but the approach could have been more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems overly sensitive. Given that the parent's primary duty is to their children, I think the author isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
