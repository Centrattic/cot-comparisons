My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to help with picking up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset and called him an asshole. Then, after some comments suggested the kids might sense her reluctance, he talked to his older son about how he feels about the situation, including his mom being away and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really angry, feeling undermined and not trusted. Now, he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights and responsibilities. He has a duty to ensure his children's well-being, especially regarding their perception of the adults in their lives. If the son was expressing concerns or the parent noticed potential issues, it's reasonable for him to address that by talking to his child. However, the way he approached the conversation might be a factor. Did he do it discreetly, or was there a breach of privacy?\n\nHe mentioned he hadn't considered the kids' feelings before, but after feedback, he took initiative. The key point here is that he's the parent, and parents should be able to talk to their children about family matters without needing permission from a partner. That's part of co-parenting. However, if the girlfriend was also a co-parent (maybe the ex-wife or a step-parent), the dynamics might be different. The original post's link is about the girlfriend being asked to take over childcare after job loss, and the kid's mother being away. So, the kids have two parents and a girlfriend. The author is the parent, so he should be able to discuss his child's feelings with them.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend felt that discussing her with the son was a betrayal. The parent needs to be careful not to badmouth her, but the conversation was about the son's perceptions, which is a valid concern. The parent's intention was to check in on his son's perspective, which is a responsible act. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left the house and said she needs to rethink the relationship. That might indicate a lack of trust in the relationship. The parent's action was about the children's well-being, but the girlfriend's feelings were hurt. So, the question is whether the parent overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son without her knowledge.\n\nBut as a parent, he's entitled to talk to his children about their family dynamics. The girlfriend might feel that the conversation was a critique of her parenting or presence in the house. However, the parent stated that the conversation was about both the son's mother's trip and the girlfriend. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong here. He's addressing his child's well-being, which is his role. The girlfriend's reaction stems from feeling criticized or undermined, which is a relationship issue, but the parent isn't necessarily the asshole for talking to his son. The problem might be in how the conversation was conducted, but the act of discussing the child's feelings is appropriate. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
