My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two children, and as a parent, he has a responsibility to check in on their well-being, especially since there's a new living situation with the girlfriend. The ex-wife is not involved, so the kids are with him and his girlfriend. The author's action was to ask his son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and their mom's absence. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's acting in the best interest of his children, ensuring they're adjusting well. Talking to his kids is a natural part of parenting. He didn't tell the girlfriend he was doing it, which might have been a mistake. If he had communicated with her first, maybe there would have been less conflict. But is that necessary?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is quite strong. She feels undermined and betrayed. Her insecurity might be due to not feeling trusted. However, the author's intent wasn't to undermine but to understand his son's views. But maybe the way he approached it without discussing with her first caused her to feel disrespected. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even though the author had a valid reason, not discussing the conversation with his girlfriend first could have been a misstep. However, parents should have the autonomy to talk to their children without interference from a partner, unless there's a legal agreement otherwise. So where's the balance here?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if the intent was purely to check on the kids. But if she's a part of the household and feels that her role is being questioned, her feelings might be valid too. However, the author isn't required to clear every conversation with her about his kids. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by not communicating with the girlfriend first. But since he's the parent, talking to his kids is his right. The girlfriend's insecurity is a red flag, but the author isn't wrong for wanting to ensure his children's adjustment. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, maybe there's a middle ground. If he had explained his intentions to her later, perhaps she'd have understood. But he didn't do that, leading to a breakdown in communication between them. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not be in the wrong for talking to his son, the lack of communication with his girlfriend could have been handled better. However, the core action of discussing his children's well-being isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, indicating possible issues in their relationship, but the author's intent was to care for his kids. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
