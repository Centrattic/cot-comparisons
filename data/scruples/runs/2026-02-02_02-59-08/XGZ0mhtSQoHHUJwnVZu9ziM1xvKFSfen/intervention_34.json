My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a dad living with his girlfriend and their two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She didn't take it well and called him an asshole. Then, after some comments on Reddit mentioned that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm, the author talks to his oldest son about how he feels about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, saying he undermined her and betrayed her. The author is now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's feeling, which includes his perception of the girlfriend. As a parent, it's important to understand the kids' feelings, especially when there are changes in their living situation, like a step-parent. The author might think that talking to his son is a responsible thing to do to make sure the kids are okay.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt that the conversation was an attack on her, showing a lack of trust. She might have felt that the author discussed her with the child behind her back, which could be seen as undermining her position. In a relationship, even step-parents, building trust is important. If the girlfriend wasn't aware of the conversation and felt betrayed, that's a valid emotion. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author had to talk to his son about the girlfriend in the first place. The author mentions that the conversation was as much about the mother's absence as about the girlfriend. So maybe he was trying to address the child's adjustment to both the mother being away and the girlfriend being part of their lives. However, the way he approached it might have been without considering how the girlfriend would perceive it. \n\nIn a co-parenting situation, especially with step-parents, communication between the adults is crucial. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing by checking in with his son, but he didn't discuss this plan with his girlfriend first. That lack of communication could have led to the girlfriend feeling disrespected. Even if the author's intention was good, not discussing it with the girlfriend first could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are real. She might feel that the author is questioning her ability to be there for the kids, even if he didn't intend to. In relationships, perception matters. The author might not see it as an attack, but if the girlfriend feels attacked, that's a problem. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with the son without her knowledge. While it's reasonable for a parent to talk to their child about their feelings, the context here involves a partner. The author's action might have been necessary to understand the child's perspective, but the way he did it without involving the girlfriend could be the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention wasn't malicious, but the action of discussing the girlfriend with the son without her knowledge might have been a mistake in terms of relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's feelings of betrayal suggest that the author might be in the wrong in how he approached the conversation, even if his motive was good.\n"
