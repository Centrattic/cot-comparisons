My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a dad who talks to his son about his perception of the girlfriend, which leads to the girlfriend being upset. The main question is whether the author was wrong in doing so.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has two kids with an ex-wife who's away. The girlfriend lost her job, and the author asked her to watch the kids a few days a week, which she took as a slight. Now, the author, concerned about the kids' feelings, talks to his son to see how he feels about the situation. The son is okay with it. But the girlfriend finds out and gets really upset, feeling undermined.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author's intention was to check in with his kids, which is a normal parenting duty. However, the girlfriend might see this conversation as an intrusion on her role or a lack of trust. The author didn't consult with the girlfriend before talking to the kid, which could be seen as overstepping. But on the other hand, parents usually need to talk to their kids about various aspects of their lives, including family members. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feeling hurt is valid. The author might not have considered how his actions would affect her. The problem is whether talking to the child about the girlfriend is within the parent's right. Since he's the parent, he has a responsibility to his children's well-being, which includes understanding their feelings about the people in their lives. However, maybe he could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by discussing with the girlfriend first if appropriate.\n\nBut the author mentions that the conversation was also about the ex-wife's trip, not just the girlfriend. So maybe the girlfriend's reaction is disproportionate. The author is not wrong for wanting to ensure his kids are okay, but maybe the way he approached it without considering the girlfriend's feelings is an issue. However, given that he's the parent, it's reasonable to have such conversations without needing permission. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parent's duty to his children outweighs the girlfriend's feelings. Since parents should prioritize their children's emotional health, and the conversation was necessary for that, the author is not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
