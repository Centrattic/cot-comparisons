My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined and that her partner doesn't have confidence in her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father has two sons, 8 and 14. He asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Now, he talked to his oldest son (14) about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mother. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are: Did talking to his son about the girlfriend cross a line? Is it okay for a parent to discuss living arrangements and relationships with their child, especially when it affects them? The father's intention was to check in with his son about how he's feeling, which seems reasonable. However, the girlfriend feels that this conversation was a direct criticism of her, which might not have been the case. The father mentions the conversation was also about his son's mother being away, so maybe it's a sensitive topic.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She left the house and wants to reevaluate the relationship. The father argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without prior approval. However, involving a child in adult relationship issues can be problematic. The son is 14, so maybe he's old enough to have such a conversation, but the way it was framed might have made the girlfriend feel targeted.\n\nThe father's action was to ensure his child is okay, which is a parent's duty. But did he have to discuss the girlfriend specifically? If the son brought up issues with the girlfriend, discussing it makes sense. But if the father initiated it to gauge the girlfriend's standing, that could be an issue. The father says he didn't mean to undermine her, but the girlfriend feels undermined. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The father might have failed to consider how his action would affect the girlfriend. Even if he had good intentions, not discussing it with her first could have been a misstep. However, it's also important for a parent to talk to their children about family dynamics. The line here is blurry. \n\nSome might say the father is in the right because it's his responsibility to check in with his child. Others might say he should have discussed it with the girlfriend first to avoid conflict. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid if she feels disrespected. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but there's a valid counterpoint. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In some cases, discussing a partner with the child without their knowledge could be seen as undermining them, even if the intent is good. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the father might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's perspective and not discussing it with her first, leading to unnecessary conflict. Alternatively, he's not in the wrong because it's a parent's responsibility to talk to their kids about their well-being. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the father not being in the wrong because the primary concern was the child's well-being, and the girlfriend's reaction seems over the top. However, the way the conversation was framed without her input could be problematic.\n"
