My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The OP has two boys, aged 8 and 14, and he lives with his girlfriend. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Then, after people commented that the kids might sense her not wanting to be there, OP talked to his oldest son (14) about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mom being away. The girlfriend found out and got really angry, saying he undermined her and lacks confidence in her, leading her to leave the house.\n\nNow, the key points here: OP's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, which seems responsible. However, the girlfriend felt that talking to the son about her was an attack or lack of trust. The question is whether OP overstepped.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, talking to your child about their feelings is usually appropriate. But when it involves another adult (the girlfriend), especially in a shared household, communication and boundaries matter. If OP didn't discuss this with his girlfriend first, maybe he should have. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She left, called him a child, and accused him of betrayal, which might indicate her being overly sensitive or insecure. \n\nOP's argument is that he needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend. That makes sense because parents should be able to discuss their children's well-being. But maybe the way he approached it could have been better. For example, involving the girlfriend in the conversation might have helped. However, the core issue is that the girlfriend is taking the conversation as a personal attack, which might not be the case. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if OP's intent was solely to understand his son's feelings and he didn't badmouth the girlfriend, he's probably in the right. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). However, OP might need to work on communication with his girlfriend to set boundaries. But in terms of being in the wrong, he's not. The girlfriend's overreaction is the main issue here.\n"
