My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a father talking to his son about his perception of the father's girlfriend. The father's girlfriend got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nSo, the father's main point is that he wanted to check in on his son's well-being after a previous issue where the girlfriend had called him an asshole. He wanted to make sure the kids were okay, especially since they might pick up on the tension. The conversation with the son included talking about the mother (the ex) being away and the current girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, saying he lacked confidence in her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intent. He mentioned that the conversation was important for the kids' emotional state and that he felt the previous situation with the girlfriend's job and childcare could affect the kids. His main goal was to assess how the kids were feeling, which seems like a reasonable parental concern. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is significant here. She felt that by talking to the son about her, the father was undermining her. There's a question about whether the father should have discussed the girlfriend in front of the son. But the father argues that it was necessary and part of the conversation about the kids' environment. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, if the father is co-parenting with his ex, the current girlfriend isn't the parent. However, the father is responsible for his children's well-being. Talking to them about their feelings is part of parenting. The girlfriend might feel that her authority or presence is being questioned, but the father's actions are about the children's needs.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The father didn't consult the girlfriend before talking to the son. While parents have the right to discuss their children's welfare with them, involving a step-parent or partner in such discussions can be tricky. The girlfriend might feel that her role is being scrutinized without her input. However, if the conversation was about the kids' adjustment to their living situation, the father's approach could be justified.\n\nThe key here is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend specifically. The father says the conversation was as much about the mother's trip as about the girlfriend. If the discussion was necessary for the child's emotional health, then the father isn't wrong. But if the focus was solely on the girlfriend to the point of making the child choose sides, that could be problematic. However, the father's intent was to check in on the kids, not to undermine the girlfriend.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction of leaving and saying the father has the maturity of a 6-year-old is extreme. But her feeling of betrayal might stem from not being informed about the conversation. The father didn't clear it with her, which could be an oversight in their communication, but the necessity of discussing the kids' well-being might outweigh that.\n\nIn parent-step-parent dynamics, the parent has the right to talk to their kids about their living situation. The step-parent isn't the legal parent, so the father isn't wrong for prioritizing his children's needs. The girlfriend's insecurity might be causing her to overreact, but the father's actions were in the kids' best interest. Therefore, the father isn't in the wrong here.\n"
