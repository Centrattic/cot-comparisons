My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where he talked to his son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a father with two kids, living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend lost her job, and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school sometimes, and she got upset. People in the previous Reddit comments mentioned that the kids might sense her not being fully engaged. The author then had a conversation with his son about the girlfriend and the situation. The girlfriend found out and was extremely upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. Now, the author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. So, I need to assess if talking to his son about the girlfriend was a mistake.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's important to check in with children to see how they're feeling about their living situation and relationships. The author's intention was to ensure the kids weren't being negatively affected, which seems responsible. However, the way he approached it might have been problematic. The girlfriend interpreted it as undermining her, which is a valid concern. Parents should consider how their actions affect their partners. If the author didn't consult his girlfriend first, even if the intention was good, it might have come across as not trusting her judgment or partnership. \n\nBut, as a parent, he has the right to talk to his children about their well-being. The key here is whether the conversation was necessary and how it was framed. If the author was genuinely concerned about the kids' feelings and the conversation was constructive and respectful, then it's more on the girlfriend's overreaction. However, if the conversation was critical of the girlfriend or made the son feel like he should choose sides, that's different.\n\nIn the author's own words, he mentions the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. That might have been a balanced approach. Still, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected. The author might need to consider that in a relationship, discussing a partner's role with the children without prior discussion can strain trust, even if the intent was to support the kids.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response seems extreme. Leaving the house and saying the author has the maturity of a 6-year-old is a strong reaction. But her feeling of betrayal is valid if she thought the conversation was a criticism of her. The author might not have been wrong in wanting to check in with his son, but he could have handled it better by discussing his concerns with his girlfriend first.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's action might not be inherently wrong, but it's possible he could have communicated differently. The girlfriend's reaction is harsh, but her feelings are understandable. The main issue is whether the conversation was necessary and how it was conducted relative to their relationship dynamics. If the author didn't clear it with his girlfriend first, that could be a mistake. But if the conversation was in the best interest of the children and conducted respectfully, it's less of an issue. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because checking on the children's well-being is important, but he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more. However, since the user asked for a choice between A and B, the answer would depend on whether the act itself was wrong regardless of intent. If the action was necessary for the kids, then B (not wrong). If it was a breach of trust, then A (wrong). Given the context, B might be the answer, but there's a nuance.\n"
