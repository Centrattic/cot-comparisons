My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author has two kids, an 8-year-old and a 14-year-old. He and his girlfriend live together, and she recently lost her job, so he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict where she called him an asshole. Now, he sat down with his oldest son (14) to discuss the situation, including how the son feels about his mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and that he lacks confidence in her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he needed to talk to his kids about their well-being, which is his responsibility as a parent. He didn't want to have to clear every conversation with his girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, is hurt and feels betrayed. \n\nSo the main question is: Was it wrong for the author to talk to his son about his girlfriend without her approval? Let's consider the dynamics. As a parent, the author has a duty to ensure his children's emotional well-being. Discussing how they feel about living arrangements and relationships (like the girlfriend) is part of that parental duty. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect their relationship or that the father didn't respect her boundaries. \n\nBut, in many cases, parents have the right to discuss family members with their children to understand their perspectives. The key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. The author mentions that the conversation was about both the mother's absence and the girlfriend. If the son was happy and there's no indication of harm, then the father might be in the right for checking in on his child's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, possibly because she feels criticized or undermined without cause. \n\nOn the other hand, if the father had discussed this with the girlfriend first, maybe they could have avoided the conflict. But the father argues that he shouldn't have to clear every conversation with her, especially regarding his children. The line between being a supportive parent and respecting a partner's feelings can be tricky. However, the father's intent was to ensure his child's well-being, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her role in the family is being questioned. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents often need to have these conversations independently. Unless there's a specific reason to involve the girlfriend (like if the child is being negatively affected), the father isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the discussion with the son was a normal part of parenting or if it was done to criticize the girlfriend. The author says the conversation was balanced, so it's probably not the former. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B). He's fulfilling his role as a parent by checking in with his son, and the girlfriend's reaction is more about her own feelings than the father's actions.\n"
