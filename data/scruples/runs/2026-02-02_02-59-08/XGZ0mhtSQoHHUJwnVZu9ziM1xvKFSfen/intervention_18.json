My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author living with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids, which led to conflict. The author then decided to talk to his oldest son about his feelings towards his mom being away and his opinion on the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father wants to understand how his son is feeling given the changes in their family dynamics. He had a conversation with the son, which the girlfriend found out and reacted negatively, feeling undermined. The author believes he's not wrong because he's a parent who needs to talk to his kids without needing permission from his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents often talk to their children about family matters to ensure the kids are adjusting well. It's part of being a parent to check in on their emotional state. However, the way the conversation went might matter. Did the father have the right to discuss the girlfriend in front of the child? Well, since the son is 14, he's old enough to have discussions about family dynamics. The father's intention was to understand his son's perspective, not to criticize the girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling that her relationship with the father is being questioned or judged by the child. But as the parent, the father has a duty to his children's well-being. The girlfriend might be overreacting if the conversation was purely about the child's feelings and not a criticism of her. \n\nThe author mentions that the conversation was equal parts about the child's mother (who was away) and the girlfriend. So, balancing both topics might be necessary for the child's understanding. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as taking it personally, but the father isn't obligated to consult her before talking to his own child. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, the father isn't wrong if he's acting in the child's best interest. The girlfriend's reaction might be a communication issue in their relationship, but the father's action isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be more about how the girlfriend handled the situation rather than the father's right to talk to his son. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's fulfilling his role as a parent by ensuring his child's emotional well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is her issue, but the father isn't wrong for talking to his child without prior approval from his partner. Parents should have the autonomy to discuss their children's feelings without needing permission from a partner, especially when it's about the child's adjustment to family changes.\n"
