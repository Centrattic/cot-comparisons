My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father of two kids, with the oldest being 14. He lives with his girlfriend, who recently lost her job. He asked her to help with the kids by picking them up from school a few days a week, which led to her calling him an asshole. Then, after some feedback on his previous Reddit post, he decided to talk to his oldest son about how he feels about the situation, including his mom being away and his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the father did something wrong by talking to his son about his girlfriend. \n\nOn one hand, as a parent, he has a responsibility to check in with his child about how they're feeling, especially regarding major life changes like a parent moving out and a new partner coming into their lives. The son was 14, an age where they can have complex feelings, so having that conversation is reasonable. The father's intention was to ensure his son wasn't being negatively affected, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend felt that the conversation undermined her. The father didn't consult her before talking to the son about her, which might have been a breach of trust from her perspective. Even though the father's intention was good, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that communication between him and her was lacking. Maybe he should have discussed his intention to talk to the son with her first, especially since the son's well-being is important, but the way it was handled might have caused unnecessary hurt.\n\nBut then again, the father has a right to talk to his children without needing permission from his partner. If he had to get her approval every time he wanted to discuss something with the kids, that could be a red flag in the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and threatening to end the relationship over a conversation that was meant to be in the child's best interest.\n\nThe key points here are the father's intent versus the girlfriend's perception. The father acted out of concern for his child's feelings, which is a parent's duty. However, the girlfriend might feel that her role as a step-parent is being questioned or not respected. The father didn't go into the conversation with malicious intent, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. It's a bit of a clash between parental responsibilities and relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of whether the father is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the father had discussed his intention with the girlfriend beforehand, maybe the situation could have been avoided. However, the father's action was about the child's well-being, which is a priority. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top, but the father's approach might have been a miscommunication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong because he had a good reason to talk to his son. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic, and the father's action was justified in his role as a parent. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
