My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, thinking he undermined her. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids as a parent, without needing to clear it with his girlfriend first.\n\nHmm, first, the key points. The author has two kids living with him and his girlfriend. He wanted to check in with his oldest son about how he feels regarding the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. The conversation was about the son's feelings towards both his biological mother (who's away) and the girlfriend. The girlfriend took it as a personal attack and left. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, from a parenting perspective, is it okay for a parent to talk to their child about their feelings towards family members, including the parent's partner? Generally, parents should have open communication with their kids. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in such a context could affect her standing or the child's perception of her. But the author's intention was to check in on the child's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She feels undermined and betrayed. Maybe she felt that the author isn't supporting her or that he's being judgmental. However, the author did mention that the conversation was also about the mother's absence, not just the girlfriend. \n\nIs there a breach of trust or respect here? The author didn't share the conversation with his girlfriend first, but as an adult, he has the right to discuss his children's feelings. However, considering that the girlfriend is a step-parent figure, maybe there's an expectation of collaboration. But the author's main duty is to his children. \n\nThe key is intent. The author's intent was to ensure his son's adjustment, which is valid. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling disrespected, but if the author approached it as a normal parent check-in, it's not necessarily wrong. However, maybe the way the conversation was framed or the content could have been sensitive. But the author claims he didn't go there to undermine her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents should be able to talk to their kids about their relationships, as long as it's age-appropriate. The son is 14, so discussing perceptions is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, but perhaps there's a communication issue between the author and his girlfriend. However, the question is if the author is wrong. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because parents have a right to discuss their children's feelings with them, and the girlfriend's reaction is an overreaction. The author is not wrong for fulfilling his parental duty without needing permission from his partner.\n"
