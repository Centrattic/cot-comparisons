My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a father living with his girlfriend and two sons, had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives his girlfriend and the situation with his mom. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a concern about his kids' well-being, especially after previous feedback about the girlfriend's behavior. He wanted to check in with his son to ensure the kids were okay. That seems like a reasonable parental action. But the girlfriend felt that talking to the son about her was a betrayal, which led to her leaving.\n\nOn one hand, parents should be able to talk to their kids about family dynamics. It's part of parenting. The author didn't just talk about the girlfriend negatively; he mentioned it was also about the son's mother's trip. So maybe the conversation was balanced. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the way the conversation was framed or the manner in which it was approached could have been an issue. Did the author approach the son in a way that might have influenced his answers? For example, leading questions or putting the son in the middle?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that being discussed without her knowledge is a breach of trust. In relationships, partners often expect some level of privacy. However, the author's intention was to check on his son's emotional well-being, which is a valid concern. The problem might be that the author didn't communicate his intentions with the girlfriend first. Even though the kids are his responsibility, involving his partner in the conversation could require some level of discussion, especially if the partner is sensitive about being discussed with the kids.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend is already dealing with job loss and stress, which might have made her more reactive. The author's action, while well-intentioned, might have been the last straw. But does that make the author wrong? It depends on whether the action itself was justified. As a parent, he should have the right to discuss family matters with his children. However, maybe the approach could have been better. Perhaps he should have discussed with the girlfriend first to avoid misunderstandings, especially since she's living in the same household and has a relationship with the kids.\n\nIn terms of maturity, the author argues he's an adult and shouldn't need permission. But relationships often require communication and sensitivity. The girlfriend's feelings are valid even if the author's actions were well-meaning. The key is whether the conversation with the son was necessary and how it was conducted. If the son was old enough to be having such a conversation and the questions were neutral and aimed at the child's well-being, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that the conversation might have been perceived as a challenge to her authority or presence in the home.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. On one side, he's a parent doing his duty to check on his child's feelings. On the other, the girlfriend feels betrayed. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of their relationship. If the author didn't go into the conversation with negative intentions and the son's well-being was the main focus, then the author is not in the wrong. But if the way he approached the conversation made the son feel like he was choosing sides or if the questions were leading, then maybe. But based on the information given, the author seems to have acted in the best interest of his child. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for interpretation.\n"
