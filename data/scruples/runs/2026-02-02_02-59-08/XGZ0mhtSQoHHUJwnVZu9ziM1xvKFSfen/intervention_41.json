My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The author lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job and the author asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to conflict. The author then had a conversation with his older son (14) to check in on how he's feeling about the situation, including the new living arrangements and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The author is concerned about his son's well-being and the impact of the recent changes on him. Talking to his son about these issues is a natural parental instinct to ensure the child is okay. The father had a valid concern, especially after seeing comments in the previous Reddit post about children sensing tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels betrayed and disrespected. The key question is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was necessary or done in a way that undermined her. The author mentions the conversation was about both the mother (who's away) and the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in such a context without her knowledge could be seen as a lack of trust, even if the intent was to check on the child's feelings.\n\nThe father's argument is that he's an adult and can talk to his kids without needing permission. That's true, but relationships involve mutual respect and communication. If the father had discussed the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand, it might have prevented the fallout. The girlfriend's reaction might be extreme, but the father could have considered her feelings more. Maybe he should have explained the intent behind the conversation once she found out, rather than assuming she'd understand.\n\nAnother angle: the son is 14, so it's appropriate for the father to have open discussions about family dynamics. However, involving the girlfriend's perception without her input might have been a misstep. The father's action was to check on his son's well-being, which is right, but the way it was handled might have been sensitive. The girlfriend's feeling of being undermined could stem from not being included in the conversation or not feeling trusted.\n\nIn terms of maturity, the author mentions feeling like he's back in high school with the drama. It's possible that both parties could have approached the situation more maturely. The father could have explained his intentions calmly once the girlfriend was upset, while the girlfriend could have approached the situation with the father to understand his motives before reacting so strongly.\n\nThe main issue here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was appropriate. The father's intent was to check on his son's feelings, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests a breakdown in communication and trust between them. The father might not be in the wrong for wanting to ensure his son's well-being, but he could have handled it better by considering the girlfriend's perspective and possibly discussing it with her before or after the conversation with the son.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the father's action was necessary for his son's welfare, but the manner in which it was done (without the girlfriend's knowledge) caused a rift. The answer hinges on whether the father's actions were justified despite the girlfriend's reaction. Since the father's intent was to protect his son and there's no indication he was malicious, he might not be in the wrong. However, the lack of communication with the girlfriend might still be a point against him. But in the context of a parent's duty to their child, I think the answer leans towards B.\n"
