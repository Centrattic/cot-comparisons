My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author talking to their son about how the son perceives the author's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, feeling undermined and unconfident in her role. The author's intention was to check in on their son's feelings, especially after previous concerns from Reddit users about the kids sensing the girlfriend's disinterest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two sons, and the younger one is 8. The girlfriend recently lost her job and was asked to help with the kids, which caused tension. The author then talked to the older son (14) about how he feels regarding the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, even leaving the house. She feels the author didn't have confidence in her.\n\nSo the key points are: 1) Did the author have a valid reason to talk to the son? 2) Was the way they approached it appropriate? 3) How does the girlfriend's reaction factor into it?\n\nThe author mentions that the conversation was about both the mother being away and the girlfriend. They wanted to ensure the kids were okay and hadn't been hurting them. The author believes it's necessary to talk to their children without prior approval from the girlfriend. The girlfriend, however, feels her position is being undermined.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's important to maintain open communication with children, especially when there are significant changes in their lives, like a new caregiver. The author's intention seems to be checking in on the kids' well-being, which is a responsibility. However, the method of approaching this might have been a factor. While it's reasonable to talk to the kids about their feelings, discussing how the son perceives the girlfriend could be seen as a sensitive topic. If the son's feedback is negative, it might reflect poorly on the girlfriend, even if that wasn't the author's intent.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014she feels betrayed and calls the author immature. This suggests that the way the conversation was conducted might have made her feel insecure or criticized. The author might not have considered how the girlfriend would react if the child expressed any negative feelings towards her. The author's action, while well-intentioned, might have inadvertently caused harm to the relationship with the girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a parent, and the children's well-being is a priority. The author might not think they need to clear every conversation with the girlfriend, as the kids' needs come first. The girlfriend's reaction could be an overreaction if the author's intention was purely to check on the kids. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid in that she might feel the conversation could lead to the child criticizing her, which could be hurtful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were to ensure the kids' well-being, which is important, but the way it was handled might not have considered the girlfriend's feelings. The author could have perhaps discussed the conversation with the girlfriend beforehand or framed it in a way that doesn't make her feel targeted. However, since the conversation was about the children's feelings in general (including the mother's absence), it's not necessarily the author's fault that the girlfriend took it as a personal attack. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own insecurities or the existing tension in the relationship rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were good, they might not have considered the girlfriend's perspective adequately. However, since the primary responsibility is to the children, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her handling of the situation. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
