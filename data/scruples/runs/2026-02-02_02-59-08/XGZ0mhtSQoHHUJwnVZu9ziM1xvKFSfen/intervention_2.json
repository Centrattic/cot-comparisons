My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation is a bit complicated. The author lives with his girlfriend and two boys. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school, which led to her getting upset. Then, the author talked to his oldest son (14) about how he feels about the girlfriend and the situation with his mother. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without prior permission and that the conversation wasn't just about the girlfriend but also about his ex-wife's absence.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong here. Let's break it down. First, the author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's feeling about the living situation and the girlfriend. As a parent, it's reasonable to want to ensure his child's well-being and how they're adjusting. However, the girlfriend's reaction was strong. She felt undermined because the conversation was about her, and she didn't know about it beforehand. \n\nThe key points here are the parent's responsibility to communicate with their children versus the partner's feelings of being respected and informed. The author might believe that as a parent, he has the right to talk to his children about family dynamics without needing permission from his partner. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child, especially in a way that could reflect on her role as a step-parent, is a breach of trust.\n\nIn many relationships, partners often discuss how they interact with their children, but when one partner talks to the child about the other partner without the other partner's knowledge, it can lead to hurt feelings. The author's action could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's position in the household, especially if the child's perception of the girlfriend is a sensitive topic. Even if the intent was good, the method might have been problematic. \n\nHowever, it's also important that the parent can have open and honest conversations with their children about their family. The problem might not be the conversation itself but how it was approached. If the author didn't involve the girlfriend in the discussion beforehand, even if it was just to inform her, it could have been handled better. The girlfriend's feeling of betrayal suggests that she might have wanted to be included in such discussions, especially since she's a part of the family now.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's intention was to check on his son's well-being, which is a parent's duty. However, the way he approached it without considering the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt undermined, which points to a lack of communication and mutual respect in the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing this with his girlfriend first or not being sensitive to her feelings, even if his intent was good.\n"
