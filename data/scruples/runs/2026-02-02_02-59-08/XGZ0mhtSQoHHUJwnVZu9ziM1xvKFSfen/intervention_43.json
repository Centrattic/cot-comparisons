My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and the author asked her to pick up the kids a few days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, the author is concerned about how the kids perceive their new situation, so he talks to his oldest son about it. The girlfriend finds out and gets extremely upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She leaves the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe main issue here is whether talking to the son about the girlfriend was the right move. The author's intention was to check in on the kids' feelings, which is a valid concern as a parent. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt disrespected or not trusted. \n\nFrom a parental standpoint, it's important to consider the children's well-being and how they adjust to family changes. The author's action was to ensure the kids weren't negatively affected. However, maybe he should have discussed this approach with his girlfriend first, especially since they're in a relationship. The girlfriend might feel that the father is taking sides or questioning her role without her consent.\n\nBut then again, parents have the right to talk to their children about family dynamics. The key here is communication. The author didn't intend to undermine the girlfriend, but the way it was done might have hurt her feelings. Did he consider her perspective before having the conversation? If he had discussed it with her, maybe they could have found a way to address the kids' concerns without making her feel attacked.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feelings are valid if she felt the father wasn't supporting her in front of the child. The author might have been trying to be a good parent, but he might have overlooked the importance of maintaining trust and partnership with his girlfriend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, talking to his kids is his responsibility. On the other, he could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by involving his girlfriend in the conversation or explaining his intentions afterward. The fact that the son had valid thoughts and the conversation included other topics (like the mother's trip) might mitigate some blame. But the girlfriend's reaction indicates a breach in trust from her perspective.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings and communicated his intentions adequately. Since he didn't mention discussing it with her first, and the conversation included her, it's possible he made a misstep. Therefore, the author might be partly at fault. But others might argue that talking to his kids is non-negotiable. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong), but it's not entirely black and white.\n"
