My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The situation involves the author having a conversation with his older son about the boy's feelings regarding his mother's absence and the girlfriend's role. The girlfriend then gets upset, feeling undermined, and the author is questioning if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that previous feedback from Reddit suggested that the kids might be picking up on the girlfriend's lack of genuine interest in being present for them. This led the author to check in with his son. The conversation wasn't solely about the girlfriend but also about the mother's absence. The author did not clear this conversation with the girlfriend beforehand, which seems to be a point of contention. \n\nThe question is whether talking to the son about this is wrong. From a parenting perspective, it's reasonable for a parent to discuss their children's feelings about their family situation. The author isn't making accusations but seeking his son's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author argues that he needs to be able to talk to his kids without prior approval from the girlfriend. \n\nIn relationships where a parent is living with a partner, there can be boundaries and sensitivities. However, the primary responsibility here is the parent-child relationship. The author's action is about understanding his son's well-being, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her role in the family is being questioned, but the author isn't criticizing her; he's just seeking his son's input. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's acting in his son's interest and as a parent's duty. The girlfriend might need to communicate her boundaries better if she's uncomfortable with such discussions. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
