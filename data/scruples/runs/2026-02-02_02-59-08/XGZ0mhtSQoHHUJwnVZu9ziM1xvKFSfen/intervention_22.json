My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset and left, feeling undermined.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The man is living with his girlfriend and his two boys. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to help with picking up the kids, which she didn't like. Then, after some Reddit feedback, he talks to his 14-year-old son about how he feels about the new living situation and the girlfriend. The girlfriend finds out and gets really upset, accusing him of lacking confidence in her. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent's right to talk to his child about family matters versus the girlfriend's reaction. The question is whether it was wrong to have that conversation without the girlfriend's consent.\n\nIn many cases, parents do need to discuss family dynamics with their children, especially when there are significant changes like a new partner or living arrangements. The author's intention seems to be to check in on his son's well-being and ensure that the kids aren't being negatively affected by the current situation. However, the girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling that her authority or her role in the family is being questioned.\n\nNow, considering the father's role, it's natural and necessary for him to communicate with his children. However, the way he approached it might have been a factor. Did he approach the conversation in a way that could be seen as critical of the girlfriend, or was it more about the child's feelings? The author mentions that the conversation was as much about his son's mother's absence as it was about the girlfriend. If the son was open about his feelings, that's part of parenting.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that the father discussed her in a way that undermined her position. If the father was critical of her in front of the child, that could be problematic. But the post says the conversation was about the son's perceptions, not necessarily negative criticism. The issue might be about trust between the two adults. The father might feel he should be able to discuss family matters with his kids without needing permission from his partner, but the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in such a context without her knowledge is a breach of trust.\n\nIn many relationships, it's important to have open communication. The father might have assumed it was necessary to check on his son's feelings, but perhaps a more collaborative approach with his girlfriend would have been better. However, the father's main concern was his children's well-being, which is a valid reason to have such a conversation. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but it's also possible that she feels insecure about her role in the family.\n\nSo, the author's actions were to ensure his son's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend's overreaction might stem from personal insecurities, but that doesn't make the father wrong. However, maybe not discussing it with the girlfriend first could be a point of contention. But given that the father is the parent and needs to maintain a relationship with his child, it's not necessarily his fault. The girlfriend might be overreacting, but the father's approach could have been more considerate of her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for talking to his son about his perceptions, as it's part of being a parent. The girlfriend's reaction is her issue, but the father's intent was to check on his child's well-being. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
