My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who lives with his girlfriend and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, he talked to his 14-year-old son about how the son perceives the girlfriend, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's intention was to check in with his son about how he's adjusting, especially since his ex-wife isn't around as much. He wanted to ensure the kids are okay. But the girlfriend took it as an attack on her, feeling undermined. She left the house and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, parents do need to talk to their kids about family dynamics, especially when there are changes. The author might have thought it was necessary to address his son's feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels disrespected, maybe because she didn't feel consulted or trusted.\n\nIs there a breach of trust? The author didn't consult the girlfriend before talking to the son. But parents do have a duty to their children's well-being. However, the way the conversation was approached might have been problematic. If the son was critical of the girlfriend, that could reflect poorly on the author's judgment. But the author says the conversation was also about the mother's trip and not just the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense\u2014calling it betrayal and comparing the author to a 6-year-old. That might be an overreaction. Still, the author didn't consider how his actions might affect the relationship with his girlfriend. Maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings, especially in a co-parenting situation.\n\nBut then again, the kids are his primary responsibility. He can't avoid talking to them just because the girlfriend might be upset. However, the way he approached the conversation might have been without sufficient sensitivity. Perhaps he should have discussed with the girlfriend first, or at least been more mindful of not putting the girlfriend in a negative light.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't consult her, maybe he is. But if the conversation was necessary for the kids' sake, maybe not. The answer hinges on whether the conversation was justified and how it was handled. The girlfriend might feel disrespected, but the father's duty to his children is also valid. The key is whether the author's actions were considered in bad faith. The author claims he didn't mean to undermine her, so intent matters. If the intent was to check on the kids, not to criticize the girlfriend, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the execution could have been better. Since the answer is either A or B, and the user is leaning towards A, but I'm split. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because checking in with his son is a parent's responsibility, though communication could have been better. But maybe A is correct because he didn't consider her feelings enough. Hmm. Let me think again. If the father had a valid reason to talk to the son, and the girlfriend's reaction is over the top, then B. If the father didn't have to involve the girlfriend's role in the conversation, then maybe A. The post says the conversation was as much about the mother's trip as the girlfriend. So he was checking on the child's adjustment. So the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
