My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. His girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to conflict. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son feels about living arrangements and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wanted to check in with his son to make sure the kids are adjusting well, especially after previous comments on his Reddit post suggested the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of willingness. He didn't clear it with his girlfriend first, which upset her. His argument is that he's a parent who should be able to talk to his kids without permission from his partner.\n\nNow, considering the possible perspectives. From the author's side: Parents have a responsibility to their children's well-being. Discussing feelings and adjustments with a child is part of parenting. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but the author might not have considered how the conversation could be perceived as undermining her.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might feel that the conversation was a challenge to her authority or role in the household. If the author didn't communicate his intentions clearly, she could feel disrespected. In a committed relationship, discussing a partner in front of the children without prior discussion might be seen as a breach of trust, depending on how it's handled.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. The intent behind the conversation. The author claims it was for the child's well-being, which is valid. However, the manner in which he approached it could be problematic. Did he frame the conversation as a way to include the girlfriend's perspective or was it more critical?\n\n2. Communication with the girlfriend. If the author had discussed his concerns with his girlfriend before talking to the son, maybe she would have felt less betrayed. Lack of communication can lead to misunderstandings.\n\n3. The girlfriend's reaction. Her feeling betrayed and questioning the relationship is a strong response. Whether it's justified depends on the context of their relationship and past interactions. If there were previous issues with trust, this could be a trigger point.\n\n4. The child's age. The oldest son is 14, so having such a conversation is age-appropriate. However, if the conversation focused more on the girlfriend's behavior rather than the child's feelings, that could be an issue.\n\nIn many cases, open communication is key in relationships. The author's failure to communicate his intentions with his girlfriend might have contributed to her feeling undermined. While the author's intention was to check on his son's well-being, the way he did it without considering his girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. It's possible he didn't mean to harm the relationship, but not discussing it with her first shows a lack of consideration for her perspective.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend first, which led to her feeling disrespected. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also extreme. The answer isn't black and white, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the situation described, the author's actions, while well-intentioned, could be seen as a breach of the girlfriend's trust by not discussing it with her beforehand. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
