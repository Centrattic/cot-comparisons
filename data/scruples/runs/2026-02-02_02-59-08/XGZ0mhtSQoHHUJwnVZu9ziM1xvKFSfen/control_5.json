My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author, a father living with his girlfriend and two sons, had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son perceives his girlfriend and the changes in his mother's situation. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and untrusted. The author is now questioning if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The father wanted to check in with his son to see how he's adjusting to his mother being away and the new living arrangements with his girlfriend. This seems like a reasonable action for a parent to take, especially since previous feedback mentioned that the kids might sense any negative dynamics. The father's intention was to ensure his child's well-being, not to undermine the girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend reacted strongly, feeling betrayed and untrusted. The author is now conflicted because he believes he needs to talk to his children without needing permission from his girlfriend. The question is whether talking to his son about the girlfriend was inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, parents have a duty to understand their children's feelings and ensure their emotional well-being. Discussing the children's perceptions of the new partner could be seen as part of that responsibility. The author did mention that the conversation was also about the mother's situation, so it wasn't solely focused on the girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in such a context, even with the intention of checking on the child's adjustment, could be seen as a lack of trust or respect. However, the father isn't criticizing the girlfriend in front of the child; he's using the child as a sounding board to assess their relationship from the child's perspective. \n\nThe key here is the intention versus the perception. The father's intention was to support his child and understand his feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling undermined, possibly due to sensitivity around being evaluated by the child. However, considering that the father is the parent, it's reasonable for him to communicate with his children about various aspects of their lives, including the new partner, as part of managing the household and the child's adjustment.\n\nThe girlfriend might need to work on her trust and communication with the father, especially in a co-parenting situation. The father isn't doing anything wrong by fulfilling his parental duties. The issue might stem from a lack of communication between the boyfriend and girlfriend about how to handle these situations, rather than the father's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as he is acting in his child's best interest and fulfilling his role as a parent without malicious intent.\n"
