My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school, which she resented. People on Reddit commented that the kids would sense her lack of being there for them. The author then talked to his oldest son about how he feels about the situation, including his mother being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. \n\nThe author argues that he needed to talk to his son about the kids' well-being and that it's necessary to communicate with his children without needing his partner's permission. The girlfriend, on the other hand, felt her position was attacked.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. Is it reasonable for a parent to talk to their child about their relationship with a partner?\n2. Did the author overstep by discussing the girlfriend in front of the child?\n3. Should the author have discussed this with the girlfriend first?\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's important that children feel they can talk to their parents about various aspects of their lives, including their relationships with others. However, the way the conversation was framed might matter. If the author was critical of the girlfriend or made the son feel conflicted, that could be a problem. But the author says the conversation was balanced, discussing both the ex-wife's absence and the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she left, saying it's a betrayal. This might indicate that the author didn't consider her feelings, even if he had a valid reason. But as a parent, the primary responsibility is to the children, so discussing the children's feelings with them is generally seen as appropriate. However, in a co-parenting or cohabitating situation, there's a balance between parental duties and respecting the partner's feelings.\n\nIn many cases, partners expect to be informed about such conversations, especially if they involve their role in the family. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before talking to the son, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intention was good. However, it's also a parent's right to discuss family matters with their children without needing approval from a partner, especially if it's about the child's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author should have discussed this with the girlfriend first. If the conversation was purely about the child's feelings and not a criticism of the girlfriend, then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the way he discussed the girlfriend made the child feel her role is negative, that could be an issue. The author states it was a balanced conversation, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt undermined regardless.\n\nIn family dynamics, transparency and communication between partners are key. The author might have failed to communicate with his girlfriend first, leading to her feeling blindsided. Even though talking to the child is a parent's right, the lack of prior discussion with the girlfriend could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not considering her feelings, even if his intention was to check in with his son.\n"
