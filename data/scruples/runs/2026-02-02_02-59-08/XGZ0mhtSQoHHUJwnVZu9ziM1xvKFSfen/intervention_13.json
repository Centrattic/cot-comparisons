My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a man in a relationship with a woman, lives with his girlfriend and two sons. His girlfriend recently lost her job and he's been supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to an argument where she called him an asshole. Now, after considering the comments from Reddit, he talks to his oldest son (14) about how the son perceives the girlfriend and his mother who's away. The girlfriend finds out and gets upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are:\n\n1. The father wants to check in with his son about his feelings regarding the new living situation and the girlfriend. This is a reasonable concern as parents often want to ensure their children are adjusting well.\n2. The method he used: talking to the son one-on-one about his perception of the girlfriend. The father's intention was to understand the son's feelings, not to criticize the girlfriend. The son was happy with the arrangement.\n3. The girlfriend's reaction: she felt undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house and reconsider the relationship. She might see this conversation as the father not trusting her or being disrespectful.\n4. The father argues that he's an adult and has the right to talk to his kids without needing permission. However, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she perceives this as a lack of confidence in her parenting or her role in the family.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The father's action was to ensure his child's well-being, but the way it was done might have been a misstep. Did he have a good reason to talk to the son? Yes. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel that discussing her in a way that could be seen as evaluating her role as a caretaker (even if not the case) is a breach of trust. The father didn't consult her first, which could be a mistake. Parents often have to balance their need to check in with their children without making a partner feel targeted.\n\nWas the conversation about the girlfriend only? The father says it was as much about the mother's trip. So maybe it wasn't entirely about the girlfriend, but the girlfriend still took it as a personal attack. The father might have approached it differently by discussing with the girlfriend first, especially since they are co-parenting. However, the father also has a right to talk to his children without needing permission, especially when it's about their well-being. \n\nIn such situations, communication is key. If the father had discussed his intentions with the girlfriend beforehand, maybe the situation could have been avoided. But since he didn't, and the girlfriend felt betrayed, the father's actions might have been inconsiderate of her feelings. However, his intention was to check on his son's welfare, which is a valid parent's concern. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the father's actions were well-intentioned. On the other, the way it was done might have been insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but her feelings are valid. The question is whether the father overstepped by not discussing it with her first. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, parents should be able to talk to their kids to ensure their happiness. However, in a shared household and relationship, transparency is important. The father might have been in the right in wanting to talk to his son but should have considered the girlfriend's perspective. Maybe he could have framed the conversation differently or discussed it with her first. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the answer is A, then he is. If B, then he's not. Given that the father's intention was good but the method might have caused hurt feelings, it's possible he's not in the wrong, but there's room for improvement. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the father should have communicated better, then he might be at least partially in the wrong. However, since the question is whether he's the asshole, which often relates to more clear-cut wrongdoings, the answer might hinge on intention vs. impact. The impact was negative, but the intention was positive. In such cases, people often say the person isn't the asshole, but they need to improve communication. So I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that better communication could have avoided the conflict.\n"
