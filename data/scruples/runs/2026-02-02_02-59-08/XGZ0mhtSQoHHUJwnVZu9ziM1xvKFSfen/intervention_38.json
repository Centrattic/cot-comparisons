My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a dad, talks to his oldest son about how the kid perceives his girlfriend. The dad's girlfriend got upset and left the house, saying he undermined her and betrayed the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad had previously asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school, and she was upset about that, even calling him an asshole. Now, he's talking to his son about how he feels about the girlfriend. The dad's intention was to check in on his son's feelings, which seems reasonable. But the girlfriend took it as a betrayal and a lack of confidence in her.\n\nHmm, the key question here is whether the dad was right to talk to his son without consulting his girlfriend first. On one hand, parents should be able to talk to their kids about family matters to ensure the kids are adjusting well. The dad was concerned about the kids' perception because of the previous incident with the girlfriend's reaction. It's important for a parent to understand their child's feelings, especially during transitions like a new step-parent.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the dad should have discussed this approach with his girlfriend beforehand to avoid misunderstandings. However, the dad mentions that the conversation was about both the mother (who is away) and the girlfriend, and that he hadn't had this conversation sooner. Since the girlfriend didn't know he was going to talk to the son, she felt undermined. But is that a valid reaction?\n\nThe dad's actions were for the benefit of his child's well-being. If he had discussed it with the girlfriend first, maybe she could have been involved, but the dad might have wanted to hear the son's honest opinion without influence from the girlfriend. The girlfriend's response seems over the top\u2014leaving the house and calling the dad a 6-year-old. That's a strong reaction. \n\nBut the dad is an adult and a parent, so he has responsibilities to his children. It's reasonable for him to talk to his kids about their relationships with other adults in the household. The girlfriend might feel insecure, but the dad's priority is the children's adjustment. \n\nI think the dad isn't in the wrong here. He acted in the best interest of his son, and the girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. However, maybe there's a middle ground where he could have communicated better. But the core issue is that he was checking in on his child's feelings, which is a parent's responsibility. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
