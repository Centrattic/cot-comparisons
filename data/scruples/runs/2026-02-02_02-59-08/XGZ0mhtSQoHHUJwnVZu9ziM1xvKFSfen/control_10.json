My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about his girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author has two kids and a girlfriend. He asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, he's talking to his oldest son (14 years old) about how the son perceives the girlfriend and the situation with his mother being away. The girlfriend found out, got extremely upset, left the house, and accused him of undermining her and lacking confidence in her. \n\nThe author's main point is that he needed to talk to his son about the situation because some Reddit commenters pointed out that the kids might pick up on the girlfriend's negative behavior. He claims the conversation was balanced, discussing both the girlfriend and the mother. He feels he's not wrong because he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without needing his girlfriend's permission. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the father's right to communicate with his child, the girlfriend's reaction, and whether the conversation was respectful or undermining. \n\nIn general, parents should have the right to discuss their children's perceptions of the people in their lives, especially when those people are involved in the household. However, the way the conversation was framed could matter. If the father was trying to get the son to take sides or criticize the girlfriend, that might be problematic. But the father says the conversation was balanced and about the son's happiness, not to undermine the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems intense. She might feel that the father is doubting her ability to care for the kids or that he's not trusting her. But if the father was just checking in with his son about how he's feeling, which is a normal parental concern, that's reasonable. However, the fact that he didn't consider communicating with his girlfriend first might have contributed to her feeling untrusted. \n\nIt's also important to consider the dynamics between the father and his girlfriend. If there's already tension, this conversation could be seen as a trigger. The author might need to have a conversation with his girlfriend to explain his intentions and reassure her that the conversation was about the child's well-being, not a critique of her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's intent seems to be in the best interest of his child. However, the method could have been improved by discussing the plan with his girlfriend first to avoid misunderstandings. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, if his intent was good and the conversation was appropriate, then he might not be. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and he might need to address that without it being a case of being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because discussing a child's well-being is a parent's responsibility. But there's a middle ground where communication with the partner could have been better. However, the core issue is the parent's duty to his child, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
