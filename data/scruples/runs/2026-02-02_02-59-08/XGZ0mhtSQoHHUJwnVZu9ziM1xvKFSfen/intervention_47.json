My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 44-year-old dad, lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to some conflict. Now, the author had a conversation with his older son (14 years old) about how the kid perceives the girlfriend and the situation with his mom. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed.\n\nThe author argues that he needed to talk to his son to understand how the kids were handling the changes, especially since his ex-wife isn't around. He felt it was important to check in on his kids' well-being without needing to inform his girlfriend first. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees this as a breach of trust, implying that the author didn't have confidence in her abilities as a step-parent.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's doing what he thinks is right for his kids. But the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt disrespected or that her role in the family was being questioned. The key here is whether talking to his son about his girlfriend without her knowledge was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, parents have a right to communicate with their children about family dynamics. On the other hand, the way the author approached the conversation might have been a problem. Did he discuss the girlfriend in a way that was critical or that made the son question her role? The author says the conversation was as much about the ex-wife's absence as about the girlfriend. But the girlfriend might still feel that her position was being evaluated without her input.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the son, a 14-year-old might not fully understand the context or might repeat things, leading to more tension. The author could have considered involving the girlfriend in the conversation if possible, to avoid making her feel excluded or criticized.\n\nThe author might not be entirely wrong, as talking to his kids is part of being a responsible parent. However, the way he approached it without discussing it with his girlfriend first might have been a misstep. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, and not informing the girlfriend about a conversation that could affect her standing with the kids might have been a breach of that trust.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with his son without her knowledge. If the conversation was neutral and aimed at understanding the kids' feelings, it's a valid action. But if it was done in a way that made the girlfriend feel undermined, then the author might be in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is severe, but her feelings need to be considered as well.\n\nIn relationships, especially when involving step-parents, communication is key. The author might have thought he was being a good parent, but he didn't consider the impact on his girlfriend. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend first, which is important in a relationship. Alternatively, if the conversation was necessary for the kids' well-being, it might be B (not in the wrong). But given the girlfriend's strong reaction and the potential for misunderstanding, the author's approach might have been hasty. So, leaning towards A.\n"
