My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a father living with his girlfriend and two kids. His girlfriend lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which caused tension. Now, he had a conversation with his 14-year-old son about how the kid feels about the living situation, including his mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author is confused because he thinks he's just talking to his son, which he should be able to do without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether the father overstepped by discussing the girlfriend with his son. The father's intention was to check in on his son's well-being, which seems reasonable. However, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she feels it's a betrayal and a lack of trust. \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The father has a responsibility to his children's emotional well-being. Having open conversations with his son about family changes, like living arrangements and parental figures, is important. But the girlfriend might feel that discussing her in front of the child could affect their relationship or the child's perception of her. \n\nIs there a breach of trust? The father didn't consult the girlfriend before the conversation, but he didn't ask the son to criticize her. The conversation was about the son's feelings, not an evaluation of the girlfriend. However, the way it was handled might have made the girlfriend feel untrusted or undervalued in the family. \n\nOn the other hand, the father is an adult with his own children. He has the right to discuss family matters with his kids. The girlfriend might need to consider that the father's actions are in the best interest of the children. But the girlfriend's reaction is also valid if she feels her role in the family is being questioned without her input.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, parents should be able to talk to their children about their lives and family dynamics. However, the father should also be mindful of how his partner might feel, especially if they're in a co-parenting situation. The girlfriend might feel that the conversation could influence the child's opinion of her, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe father's argument that he's not in high school anymore and that he's an adult trying to handle family matters is a point in his favor. But the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that her feelings were hurt, possibly because she felt the conversation was a critique of her as a partner or co-parent. \n\nI need to weigh the father's duty to his children's emotional health against the girlfriend's right to feel respected and trusted. The key here is the intent versus the impact. If the father's intent was solely to check in with his son, which it seems like, then maybe he's not at fault. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about feeling undermined, which might indicate a lack of communication between the two adults. \n\nSo, considering all this, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for talking to his son, but he might have failed to communicate with his girlfriend first. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also a bit extreme if the conversation was just about the child's feelings. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the father has a right to discuss family matters with his children, even if it includes his partner, as long as it's not malicious.\n"
