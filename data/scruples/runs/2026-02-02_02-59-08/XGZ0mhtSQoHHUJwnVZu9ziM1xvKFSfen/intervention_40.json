My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he talked to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. The author argues that he needed to talk to his kids without needing to clear it with his girlfriend first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, so he has a responsibility to check in with his children about their well-being, especially since the kids are adjusting to a new living situation with his girlfriend. The fact that the girlfriend lost her job and is being supported by the author might add some stress there. \n\nBut the key point is the conversation with the son. The author's intention was to understand his son's feelings, which seems like a reasonable parental action. However, the girlfriend perceived this talk as a criticism of her and felt it undermined her authority. The author didn't mention the girlfriend was present in the conversation, but maybe the way he approached the topic made her feel targeted.\n\nThe question is whether discussing the girlfriend's role with the son is wrong. On one hand, parents should be able to talk to their kids about family dynamics. On the other hand, the timing and method might matter. Did the author approach the conversation with respect and care, ensuring that the son felt supported and that the girlfriend's role was discussed fairly? If the conversation was framed in a way that made the son critical of the girlfriend, that could be problematic. But the author says the son was happy with the situation, so maybe the conversation was balanced.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014leaving the house and wanting to rethink the relationship\u2014but her feelings are valid if she felt disrespected. The author didn't clear it with her first, which could be an issue in their communication. However, parents do have the right to discuss family matters with their children without needing permission from a partner. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If he approached the conversation with his son in a way that was constructive and not to criticize the girlfriend, then he's not wrong. But if he did it in a way that made the girlfriend feel attacked, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings. The fact that the girlfriend is a co-parent figure here complicates things. Maybe the author should have discussed with her first, but the necessity to communicate with his children is also important.\n\nIn the end, the author's intention was to ensure his kids' well-being, which is a valid reason. However, the girlfriend's reaction highlights a possible lack of communication between them. The author might not be in the wrong for talking to his son, but there could be room for better communication strategies to avoid such conflicts. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether talking to the son without the girlfriend's knowledge was appropriate. Given that it's a parent's role to talk to their kids, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's definitely a need for better communication between the author and his girlfriend.\n"
