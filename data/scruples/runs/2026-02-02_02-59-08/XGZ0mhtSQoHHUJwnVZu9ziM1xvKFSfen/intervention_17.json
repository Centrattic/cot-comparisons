My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a parent having a conversation with their son about the parent's girlfriend and then facing backlash from the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a father living with his girlfriend and two sons. He asked his girlfriend to pick up the kids from school a couple of days a week, which led to her being upset. Then, after some Reddit feedback about the kids sensing the girlfriend's resentment, he talked to his oldest son (14) about how he perceives the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, accusing the author of undermining her. The author feels he's not wrong because he needed to talk to his child without permission.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. \n\nOn one hand, parents should be able to discuss their children's well-being, including their relationships and how the household is functioning. The author's intention was to understand his son's feelings, which is a reasonable parental action. The girlfriend's reaction seems excessive, as the conversation was between parent and child, and it's a normal part of parenthood to check in with kids about their opinions of the adults in their lives.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have considered the girlfriend's feelings more. Even though he had a legitimate reason, the way he approached the conversation might have been sensitive. But the main issue is that the parent has a right to talk to their children about family matters without needing permission. The girlfriend's anger for that seems unwarranted. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. The key is that the conversation was about the child's well-being, and parents need that autonomy. The girlfriend's overreaction points more to her own issues rather than the parent's wrongdoing. So the answer should be B.\n"
