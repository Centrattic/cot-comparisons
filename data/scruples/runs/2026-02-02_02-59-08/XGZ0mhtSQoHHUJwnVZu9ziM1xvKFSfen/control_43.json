My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is a 44-year-old man living with his girlfriend (32F) and his two sons, 8 and 14. The girlfriend recently lost her job and he's supporting her. He asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, and she got upset, calling him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son about how the son feels about his mom being away, the current living situation, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and reacted strongly, feeling undermined and betrayed, leading her to leave the house to stay with a friend.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by talking to his son about the girlfriend? The user wants an A or B answer, so I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFrom a parental perspective, it's generally accepted that parents should be able to talk to their children about family dynamics, especially when considering the child's well-being. The author had a conversation with his son to check in on how he's feeling, which is a responsible and caring action. The girlfriend's reaction seems intense, possibly because she felt her position in the family was being questioned or that the conversation was a criticism of her. However, the author's intention was to understand his son's feelings, not to undermine the girlfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that discussing her with the child without her consent could affect the child's perception of her. But the author is the child's parent, and it's part of their role to communicate with their children. The fact that the author included the situation with the ex-wife (the children's mother) and the current living arrangements suggests he's being fair and open.\n\nThe main issue here is the girlfriend's reaction. While the author's actions were reasonable, the girlfriend might need to consider that the parent should be able to talk to their children. However, the author could have perhaps been more sensitive in how he approached the conversation, but the act itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn similar situations, the consensus often is that parents should prioritize their children's emotional well-being and have open communication. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having the conversation. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't make the author the asshole in this scenario.\n"
