My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father living with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the father asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week, which led to a conflict. Now, he sat down with his oldest son (14) to talk about how he perceives the girlfriend and the situation with their mom (the author's ex?). The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father had a conversation with his son about his feelings towards the girlfriend. The girlfriend took it as a personal attack and left. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, it's important to check in with kids about their feelings, especially when there are significant changes in their family structure, like a new partner. The father didn't talk to the son to criticize the girlfriend but to understand the child's well-being. However, the father didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a misstep. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. If she's in a committed relationship with the father, it's reasonable for him to discuss his children's feelings without prior approval. The kids' emotional well-being should be a priority. That said, maybe the father could have approached the conversation differently, like ensuring the son felt comfortable and not putting the girlfriend in a negative light. However, the main issue here is the father's right to talk to his children about their lives and relationships without interference from his partner.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests insecurity or feeling that her position in the family is not respected. But as adults, the father has the responsibility to his children. It's not about \"clearing it with her first\"\u2014he's the parent. The fact that he did this without her consent might be a point of contention, but it's a necessary part of parenting. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's acting in his children's best interest, which is a parent's duty. The girlfriend's reaction is over the top, and the father isn't the asshole for wanting to know how his kid feels about the new partner.\n"
