My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user (44M) has a girlfriend (32F) and two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and the user asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week to watch them. She got upset and called him an asshole. Now, after some comments on Reddit suggested that the kids might sense her not wanting to be there, the user sat down with his oldest son (14) to talk about how he perceives his mom (the ex?), the current girlfriend, and the living situation. The girlfriend found out and is now upset, feeling undermined and that the user lacks confidence in her. She left the house to stay with a friend.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that he needs to talk to his kids without his girlfriend's permission because he's a parent. He didn't mean to undermine her, and the conversation was about both the kids' mom and the girlfriend. \n\nSo the question is whether the user is wrong to have this conversation with his son. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's responsibility. Parents should talk to their kids about family dynamics to understand their well-being. The user did have a valid reason to check in with the child, especially if there were previous concerns about the girlfriend's attitude. However, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She feels betrayed and undermined. \n\nThe key point is whether the user overstepped by discussing the girlfriend's role without her consent. While parents have the right to discuss their children's lives, bringing up the girlfriend's behavior could be seen as a breach of trust. The user didn't mention consulting the girlfriend before talking to the son, which might be necessary if the kids are old enough to discuss such topics. \n\nAlso, the context matters. The user had previous issues where the girlfriend was upset about being asked to take care of the kids. The user's intention was to ensure the kids' well-being, but the method might have been poor. If the conversation was more about the kids' feelings towards their mother and the new living situation, maybe the girlfriend's role as a stepmom was part of that. However, the way the user approached it might have made the girlfriend feel criticized. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user might have assumed he could talk to the child without involving the girlfriend, but if the child's perception of the girlfriend is negative, the parent's role is to address that. However, if the parent is using the child's perspective to judge the girlfriend's performance, that could be problematic. \n\nSo, is the user wrong? If the conversation was necessary for the child's well-being and part of the parent's duty, maybe not. But if it was done without considering how the girlfriend might feel and without discussing it with her first, then perhaps he is in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this was a breach of trust, which is a significant issue in a relationship. \n\nBalancing the parent's duty to the child versus respecting the partner's feelings. If the user had a genuine concern about the child's adjustment and the girlfriend's role, maybe he should have approached it differently, perhaps discussing it with the girlfriend first. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though talking to the child is important, the way it was done without considering the girlfriend's perspective might have been disrespectful. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because parents should be able to discuss their children's lives without interference. \n\nBut given that the girlfriend felt betrayed and the user didn't communicate with her first, maybe the answer is A. However, the user's intention was about the child's well-being, so maybe B. Hmmm. This is tricky.\n"
