My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a father with two sons, living with his girlfriend. His girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She was upset about that, called him an asshole. Then, he had a conversation with his oldest son about how he feels about his mom being away and about the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was really upset, feeling undermined and betrayed. She left the house to stay with a friend and wants to rethink the relationship.\n\nThe author is saying that he talked to his son because he was concerned about the kids' well-being, especially after people on Reddit mentioned that the kids might sense the girlfriend's lack of enthusiasm. He felt it was important to check in with his son. Now the girlfriend is upset, thinking he's not respecting her.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong here? Let's break it down.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, talking to their children about their feelings and relationships is usually seen as responsible. Parents need to be aware of how their children are adjusting to new family dynamics. The author's intention was to ensure his kids were okay, which is a valid concern. He didn't go to the son to undermine the girlfriend; he was also discussing his ex-wife's absence. So his primary motive was the child's well-being.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is strong. She felt that the conversation was undermining her authority or presence in the household. Maybe she felt that discussing her in front of the child without her consent was a breach of trust. In a co-parenting or step-parent situation, communication is key. If the author didn't discuss this with her first, even if his intention was good, it might have been a misstep in terms of respecting her feelings.\n\nBut on the other hand, parents need to be able to talk to their kids without having to get permission from their partner. Especially when it comes to the child's emotional state. If he had discussed it with her first and she was against it, maybe that's a different scenario. However, he might not have thought she would take it that way. The key here is the intention versus the impact. The author's intention was to check in with his son, which is appropriate. The impact was hurtful to the girlfriend, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong, unless he intentionally went out to undermine her.\n\nAnother angle: in a household with a partner, there might be expectations of how certain topics are handled. If the girlfriend felt that the conversation was critical of her or made the son question her role, that's a problem. The author might not have realized how it would be perceived. But again, the parent's duty to their child is paramount. Unless there was a prior agreement that such discussions needed her approval, the author is within his right to talk to his son.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong). The author had a valid reason to talk to his son about his feelings and the family situation. The girlfriend's reaction is her own issue, and while he could have perhaps communicated better with her first, the act itself isn't wrong. The main point is that a parent should be able to discuss family matters with their children without needing permission from a partner, especially when it's about the child's well-being.\n"
