My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking to his son about how the son perceives the girlfriend. The original situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and two kids. The girlfriend lost her job and he asked her to pick up the kids, which she reacted badly to. Then he talked to his oldest son about his feelings towards the mom being away and the girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and got really upset, accusing him of undermining her and not having confidence in her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are the father's intent to check in with his son about how he's handling the situation, which is a parent's responsibility. But the girlfriend felt that this conversation was a betrayal. The father argues that he's an adult and should be able to talk to his kids without his girlfriend's permission. \n\nThe question is about whether the father is wrong. Legally, as a parent, he has the right to discuss family matters with his children. However, relationship-wise, there might be communication issues. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but her feeling undermined could be because she felt her role as a de facto caregiver was being questioned. The father might not have consulted her first, which could have caused her insecurity. \n\nBut the father's main concern was his son's well-being, which is a valid reason. However, he might have considered involving the girlfriend in the conversation to avoid her feeling undermined. Alternatively, maybe the way he approached the topic was the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's action is part of his parental duty, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. But he should have handled it with more sensitivity towards the girlfriend's feelings. The answer would likely be B (No), because he's not the asshole here. However, there's a nuance where he could have been more considerate, but that doesn't make him wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is over the top, but that doesn't mean the father was wrong to talk to his son.\n"
