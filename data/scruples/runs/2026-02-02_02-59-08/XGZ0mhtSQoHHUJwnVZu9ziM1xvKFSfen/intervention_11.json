My girlfriend recently lost her job and I have been supporting her since. I asked her to pick up the boys from school a couple of days a week and watch them - she called me an asshole.\n\nA lot of the comments on my last post mentioned how my kids would pick up on this kind of behavior and that they could sense her not wanting to actually be there for them. I hadn\u2019t considered this before and it was definitely a wake up call for me. So I sat down last night with my oldest and asked him what he thought of everything. His mother being away, living with me full time and what he thought of my girlfriend. I should have had this conversation a long time ago, but as all parents know time just seems to fly by and nothing gets done. My son had some valid thoughts and overall was very happy with how things were going so I was relieved to know I hadn\u2019t unknowingly been hurting my children. \n\nAnd then my girlfriend realizes that I\u2019ve had this conversation, and goes through the roof. She thinks I\u2019ve undermined her by talking to him about her, and says I have absolutely no confidence in her whatsoever. She left the house at 10:30 to stay with a friend and basically said she needs to rethink the entire relationship. That I have betrayed her and that I have the maturity level of a 6-year-old.\n\nI understand some of her points, but we are adults. I have two children that I obviously need to be able to talk to without clearing it with my girlfriend first. I did not go to my son to undermine my girlfriend and our conversation was just as much about his mother\u2019s trip as it was about her. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m back in high school with this drama, and there is no way I\u2019m venting to my friends so here I am Reddit - asking once again, Am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 44-year-old dad, lives with his girlfriend and his two sons. The girlfriend recently lost her job, and he asked her to pick up the kids from school a few days a week. She called him an asshole. Then, after getting advice from Reddit, he talked to his oldest son about how he perceives the girlfriend and his mom. The girlfriend found out and is upset, feeling undermined.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's correct. They want a binary answer, A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's intention was to check in with his son about his feelings towards the girlfriend and his mom. He argues that he's an adult and needs to talk to his kids without permission from his girlfriend. The girlfriend feels betrayed and that her position was undermined. \n\nFrom a parental perspective, talking to your children about their guardians is important for their well-being. The author might be justified in wanting to ensure his son feels supported. However, the way he approached it might have been a problem. He didn't consult his girlfriend first, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, not discussing it with her beforehand could have caused her distress. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. Calling him an asshole and leaving the house might be an overreaction. The author's action was to protect his child's emotional state, which is a parent's responsibility. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her role in the family is being questioned without her input. \n\nThe key here is the balance between a parent's duty to their children and respecting their partner's feelings. The author didn't explicitly go to undermine the girlfriend; he just wanted to know how his son felt. However, he should have considered discussing the conversation with his girlfriend first, especially since she's a co-parent. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he had discussed this with his girlfriend beforehand, there might have been less conflict. But since he did it for the child's welfare, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. The author's actions were necessary, but maybe the approach could have been better. \n\nI think the answer is more nuanced. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because talking to his child is important. But he could have handled it more sensitively by involving his girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems excessive. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since he did it for a valid reason (child's well-being) and it's a parent's right to talk to their kids, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he didn't communicate with his girlfriend first might be where the issue lies. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend's role in the family is being questioned without her consent, that's a problem. But the author's intention was not to undermine her. The problem is that he didn't consider her feelings, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the right because protecting the child's emotional state is crucial, but he could have handled it better. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), but there's a gray area. However, given the girlfriend's overreaction and the author's good intentions, the answer is probably B.\n"
