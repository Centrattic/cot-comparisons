My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they haven't responded to their mom's \"I love you\" texts for four years. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author was taken into foster care when they were 6 because their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which included crack cocaine during pregnancy. They were adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and an African American mother, who they love. After turning 18, the biological mom contacted them through Facebook. She apologized for her past actions and expressed regret, but the author didn't ask her about their actual father or other personal details. Instead, they just stopped speaking to her. Now, the mom sends messages like \"I love you\" and the author doesn't respond. They're wondering if they're the asshole for not returning the love.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The mom was absent for a significant part of the author's life and had serious issues. The author was in a situation where they were legally separated from her, and she left them with only photos. Now that they've reconnected, there's a lot of emotional baggage. The author's adoptive parents are a big part of their life, and the biological mom's actions have caused lasting trauma.\n\nIn the AITA community, people often look at intention and context. The author isn't ignoring the mom out of spite but because of the emotional distance and the trauma caused. They might not be ready to reconnect or express love towards someone who wasn't there for them. The mom's actions, including drug use during pregnancy and neglect, are serious and could have lasting effects on the child.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being unkind by not responding at all. The mom is trying to reach out and rebuild a relationship, even if she's made mistakes. But given the circumstances, especially the mom's absence and the author's right to set boundaries, it's understandable. The author hasn't blocked her or sent negative messages, just chosen not to respond. That might be a form of self-protection rather than intentional harm.\n\nI also need to think about the adoptive parents' perspective. The author is with a family that provided a stable environment, so they might feel more loyalty towards them. The biological mom's attempts to reconnect might be seen as intruding on that. The author might not be ready to accept her back into their life, especially since she can't provide the answers they wanted about their heritage or identity.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of forgiveness and healing. The mom is clean now and trying to make amends, but the author's feelings are valid. They might not trust her yet, and it's their right to take time. Not responding to her messages could be a way to maintain emotional distance while keeping the door open for future communication. It's not necessarily a malicious act if they're not ready to engage.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a result of past trauma and the need to set boundaries. While the biological mom is making efforts, the author isn't obligated to respond immediately or at all. Their choice to not engage in the relationship is a personal one, and they aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being.\n"
