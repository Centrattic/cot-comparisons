My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy: the mom was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being in foster care and adopted. After turning 18, the mom contacted them, and the author found out a lot of painful truths. Now the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mom was absent for most of their life due to legal issues and addiction. When they did reconnect, the author discovered painful information that their mom didn't even know their own father or nationality. The author feels disconnected, seeing their mom as a stranger despite her efforts to reconnect.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not responding? Well, the mom is reaching out, but the author has a lot of unresolved trauma. Not responding could be seen as cold, but given the context, maybe it's understandable. The author might not be ready to engage, especially if they haven't processed their feelings yet. On the other hand, the mom is trying to be part of their life, and ignoring her could be seen as cutting her off without a clear reason.\n\nBut the key points are the history of neglect and the author's right to emotional boundaries. The author might not owe their mom love or communication, especially if they haven't built a relationship. The mom's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author's decision to not engage could be a form of self-protection. The question is whether that makes them the asshole. Since the mom's actions were a major part of the problem, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding. They have the right to set boundaries based on their experiences. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
