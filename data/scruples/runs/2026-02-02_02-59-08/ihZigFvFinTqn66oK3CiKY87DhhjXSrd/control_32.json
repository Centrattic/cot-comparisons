My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the backstory is important. The mom was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was put in foster care and then adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After 18, she reached out on Facebook, and the author had a lot of questions. The mom admitted to using crack during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels she's a stranger and can't return the love. The author hasn't responded to her texts for four years.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. Well, the author has valid reasons. The mom abandoned them, had drug issues, and the author was in foster care. The lack of contact for so many years is significant. Also, the author is dealing with the emotional aftermath of discovering their mother's past. The mom is now trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't had time to process this. The author's feelings of not knowing the mom and not being able to trust her again are understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is expressing love and trying to make amends. The author's choice to cut off communication could be seen as a way to protect their own emotional well-being. The fact that the author has an adoption family that they love suggests they have support. The mom's actions in the past caused trauma, and the author is dealing with that trauma. Not responding isn't about being cruel but about setting boundaries after being hurt.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with a complex situation where past trauma affects their ability to reconnect. The answer should be B.\n"
