My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're an asshole for not responding to their mom's texts for four years.\n\nFirst, the background: The author was neglected by their birth mother, leading to foster care and adoption. Their mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After that, she reached out, but the author found out she didn't know their father or nationality. Now, she sends love messages, but the author doesn't respond, leading to the question if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's mom had a history of serious issues, which led to the author being in foster care. The author was cut off from their birth mother for most of their life. After turning 18, the mother reaches out, but the author is hurt and doesn't respond. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the author sees her as a stranger.\n\nThe key factors here are the mother's past actions and the author's emotional response. The mother's behavior was harmful, leading to the author being separated from her. The author is dealing with the trauma of that separation and the subsequent lack of information about their heritage. It's understandable that they might struggle with forgiveness and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is now clean, found religion, and wants to reconnect. But the author doesn't feel that this makes up for the past. The author's decision not to respond is a form of emotional self-preservation. They might not be ready to engage, given the history.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the situation is complex. The mother's actions were definitely wrong, causing the author significant harm. The author's lack of response is a way of protecting themselves. But the question is about whether they're an asshole for not responding. \n\nIf we consider the mother's current efforts to reach out, maybe the author could be expected to at least acknowledge her attempts, even if not reciprocate love. However, given the trauma and the fact that the mother caused the initial harm, the author's lack of response might be justified. \n\nThe answer might depend on the balance between the mother's past actions and the author's right to emotional boundaries. Since the mother was the one who caused the initial harm and the author is still processing that, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have the right to set boundaries and take time to heal. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
