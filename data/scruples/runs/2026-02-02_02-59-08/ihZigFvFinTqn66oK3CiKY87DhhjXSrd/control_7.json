My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The story is pretty detailed. Let me break it down.\n\nThe person's mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in foster care and eventually adopted by a different family. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they were 18. When they turned 18, the mom reached out, but the person felt hurt because the mom didn't know important things about their heritage and didn't have answers. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love but the person doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions led to the child being taken away. The child was in a different family, so the relationship was severed for a significant part of their life. The mom had issues with drugs and didn't know the father, which adds to the child's frustration. The person is struggling with their identity and feels the mom isn't giving them the information they need. They don't reciprocate the messages because they feel it's too soon or not enough.\n\nIs the person wrong for not responding? Well, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the person has valid reasons for their distance. They were traumatized and need time to build trust. The mother's lack of knowledge about their heritage and the circumstances of their birth could be a significant source of pain. The person isn't ignoring the messages out of malice but because of unresolved trauma and a lack of closure.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the person could be more open to communication, even if they don't return the love yet. But considering the history, it's understandable that they're hesitant. The key points are the mother's past actions, the forced separation, and the emotional neglect. The person isn't being cruel; they're processing their feelings. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the context justifies their response. They're not ignoring out of spite but due to valid emotional reasons.\n"
