My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The author has a complicated history with their mother, including child neglect, drug abuse, and being separated since childhood. They were adopted and have a loving adoptive family. After turning 18, the mother contacted them, but the conversation left the author feeling hurt and disconnected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The mother's past actions had a significant impact on the author's life, leading to years of separation and emotional trauma. The author's decision to not respond could stem from unresolved pain, anger, and a lack of trust. It's important to recognize that healing from such experiences isn't straightforward.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they can't love their mother because she's a stranger. They might be struggling with feelings of betrayal and confusion about their identity. The mother, while now clean and involved in a church, may not have made up for her past actions in the author's eyes. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could try to rebuild the relationship, showing forgiveness. But others might see the author's stance as justified given the history. The key here is understanding that the author's actions are rooted in deep emotional wounds. They're not being inconsiderate out of spite, but rather due to genuine hurt and a lack of connection. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Their response is a result of their painful past, and they're not obligated to show love or respond if they don't feel ready. It's a complex situation where the author's emotional state and history play a major role.\n"
