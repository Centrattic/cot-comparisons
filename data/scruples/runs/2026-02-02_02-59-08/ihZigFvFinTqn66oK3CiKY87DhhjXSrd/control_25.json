My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. They have a complicated history. Their mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the child being in foster care and then adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she was apologetic but didn't have answers about their father or heritage. Now, the mom sends messages of love and support, but the person doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's absence, the trauma involved, and the current situation where the person isn't reciprocating the messages. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nI think it's important to consider the context. The mother wasn't there for most of their life, had legal issues, and caused significant trauma. The person might be dealing with a lot of unresolved feelings and trust issues. Not responding could be a coping mechanism. The mother, while clean and wanting to reconnect, is still part of that painful past. The person might not feel ready to engage emotionally, especially since their mom didn't provide closure or answers when they were seeking them. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reach out, showing she cares now. But the person's lack of response isn't just about ignoring someone; it's about not being able to overcome past trauma. It's their right to set boundaries, especially if they're not ready. So, considering all that, the answer would probably be that the person isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their actions based on their experiences.\n"
