My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had a very traumatic childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6. They were put in foster care and adopted by a new family they love. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, the author was curious but found out the mom didn't know things about their father or heritage. The author hasn't spoken to her since, but the mom keeps sending messages, and the author doesn't respond. The question is if the author is the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect, abuse, and abandonment by the mom. The author hasn't been in contact with her for a long time, and even when they did, the information the mom provided was unhelpful and painful. The author is not returning the messages because they feel hurt and disconnected. They don't see her as a mom but as a stranger who caused them harm. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, it's understandable that the author is struggling with trust and feelings of resentment. The mom's actions caused real harm, and it's natural for the author to have difficulty forming a relationship now. The author isn't ignoring the mom out of malice but because of unresolved pain and trauma. The mom's messages might be well-intended, but the author isn't in a place to reciprocate love or engagement.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. Since the author is actively trying to distance themselves from someone who caused them significant trauma, it's not about right or wrong in a simple sense. The author's actions are a result of their past experiences and emotional state. They're not being cruel on purpose; they're dealing with the consequences of their mother's past actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. They are processing their trauma and haven't healed enough to reconnect, which is a valid and understandable position.\n"
