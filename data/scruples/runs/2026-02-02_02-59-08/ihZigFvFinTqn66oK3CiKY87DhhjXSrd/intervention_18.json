My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The user thinks they might be, but they're unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context the author provided. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the child being placed in foster care and eventually adopted by a new family. The mother wasn't allowed to contact them until the author turned 18. When they reconnected, the mother reached out via Facebook, and there was an emotional conversation where the mom expressed regret for her past actions and her addiction. However, the author felt let down because the mom couldn't answer basic questions about their heritage or identity. The author hasn't spoken to her since, even though the mom continues to send messages expressing love and wanting to be part of their life.\n\nSo the core issue here is the author's decision to not engage with their mother despite her efforts. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (ITA) for this. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a traumatic childhood, separated from their birth mother, and then reunited at 18. The mother has made amends, is clean, and is trying to rebuild the relationship. The author, however, feels disconnected and can't find it in themselves to respond. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's important to note that the author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a history. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and it's understandable that the author might struggle to forgive or reconnect. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of spite or malice but because of emotional barriers stemming from their shared history. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is making genuine efforts to reconnect, and the author's continued silence might be seen as dismissive. However, considering the circumstances\u2014years of absence, the traumatic reasons for separation, and the author's valid feelings of resentment and confusion\u2014it's a complex situation. The author isn't obligated to respond if they haven't healed from the past. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple matter. The author's decision is a personal one, influenced by their experiences. They might not be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. The mother's attempts to connect are positive, but the author's lack of response isn't necessarily malicious. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's actions are a result of their personal history and emotional response, not a deliberate harm.\n"
