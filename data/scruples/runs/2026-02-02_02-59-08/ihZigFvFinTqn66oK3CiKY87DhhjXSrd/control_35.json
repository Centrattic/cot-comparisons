My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The background is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the mom was arrested when the person was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in a foster home and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she was emotional and admitted to drug use during pregnancy, not knowing the father, etc. Now, the mom texts them love and encouragement, but the person doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the key points here: The mom had a past that led to the child being separated, and the child was in a good adoptive home. After 18, the mom reappears, but the person isn't ready to reconnect. They feel like a stranger to her. The person says they can't find it in themselves to love her back.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the mom did some serious stuff that led to the child being taken away. The child was in a stable home and has a loving adoptive family. The mom's actions caused the separation, and even though she's trying to reconnect now, the child isn't ready. The person isn't ignoring her out of malice; they're dealing with the trauma and lack of a real relationship. The mom is a stranger from the past with a problematic history. So, the person isn't obligated to respond positively. They have the right to set boundaries. Therefore, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re handling the situation as someone who's been wronged and hasn't reconciled yet.\n"
