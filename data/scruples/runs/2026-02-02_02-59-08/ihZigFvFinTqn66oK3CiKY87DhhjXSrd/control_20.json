My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hasn't been responding to their mom's messages for four years. The backstory involves the mom being arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was in foster care and then adopted. After turning 18, the mom contacted them via Facebook, but the author felt let down because the mom couldn't answer personal questions. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's actions. She was arrested for serious issues, leading to the child being taken away. That's a big deal. The child was in a foster home and then adopted, so there's a significant break in the relationship. The mom was using crack cocaine during pregnancy, which adds to the trauma. Even though she's clean now and found religion, the damage was done a long time ago.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the mom is a stranger. They were forced apart by legal action, and the author has built a life with their adoptive parents. The mom's attempts to reconnect after 18 years might not feel genuine enough, especially if the author feels the mom didn't take responsibility properly or provide answers. The author's refusal to respond could be a way of protecting their emotional boundaries, given the history.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to be part of the author's life. But the author has every right to feel conflicted. The trauma of being separated, the neglect, and the lack of closure make it hard for the author to forgive or connect. The author isn't ignoring out of spite but because of unresolved pain and distrust.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's not about right or wrong in a black-and-white sense. Healing from such a history takes time. The author's actions are a personal response to their trauma. They're not obligated to respond to someone who caused them harm. The mom's attempts are good in intent, but the author's right to set boundaries is valid. The key point is that the author's non-response isn't malicious; it's a result of emotional barriers built over years of neglect and separation. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
