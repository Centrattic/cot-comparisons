My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. The situation is pretty complex. The mom had a history of drug abuse and child neglect, leading to the author being placed in foster care and adopted. After 18, the mom reconnected, but the author feels a lot of unresolved issues and can't forgive her. Now, the mom is trying to maintain a relationship through texts, but the author isn't responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom's actions caused significant trauma and separation. The author was neglected and then cut off for years. Reconnecting after such a long time, especially with the mom's past, might be really hard. The author's feelings of being a stranger to their mom make sense given the history. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is showing effort to maintain a relationship and that the author could at least acknowledge the messages. However, considering the trauma and the lack of prior relationship, the author's reluctance to engage is understandable. The author isn't ignoring out of spite but because of deep emotional wounds and a lack of a real connection. \n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the forced separation, the author's adoption into a loving family, and the sudden re-entry of a parent who caused harm. The author's inability to reciprocate love isn't just about being rude; it's a result of complex emotions and a broken relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and not being able to forgive and reconnect immediately.\n"
