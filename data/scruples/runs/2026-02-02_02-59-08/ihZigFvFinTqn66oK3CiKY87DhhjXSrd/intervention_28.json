My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. They have a complicated background with their mom being absent due to legal issues and drug abuse when they were young. The mom was arrested for child neglect and couldn't contact them until they were 18. After turning 18, they reached out and had a conversation where the mom expressed regret but also didn't have clear answers about their heritage or father's identity. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their mother's absence and neglect. The mom's actions when the author was a child were harmful, leading to foster care and adoption. The author's current lack of response could stem from unresolved trauma and anger. The mom did reach out after so long, but the author feels she's a stranger. The author's feelings of not being able to love her back might be justified given the history.\n\nThe question is whether not responding is wrong. From an emotional standpoint, the author has valid reasons for not engaging. The mother's absence was legally enforced, and the author's trauma might make it hard to reconnect. However, from a family relations perspective, ignoring someone who is trying to reconnect could be seen as cutting off a parent. But considering the mother's history and the author's feelings, it's more about healing and personal boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether intent to harm is present. The author isn't ignoring the mom out of spite but out of unresolved issues. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
