My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a really tough childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to their placement in foster care and adoption. They were separated from their mom until age 18, with no contact allowed. When they finally reconnected, the mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. Now, the mom texts expressing love and missing them, but the author doesn't respond, feeling it's too soon and that the mom is a stranger.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, considering the trauma and neglect, the author's feelings are valid. They were taken away from their mom, didn't know her for years, and now she's contacting them with a lot of unresolved issues. The author is struggling with trust and healing. Ignoring texts might be a protective mechanism. The mom's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond immediately. Relationships take time to rebuild, especially under such circumstances. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries to protect their emotional well-being. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
