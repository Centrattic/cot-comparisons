My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages over four years. The author's mom had a troubled past, including child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the author being placed in foster care. After turning 18, the mother reached out, but the author hasn't responded since and now feels conflicted about not reciprocating love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, leading to the child's separation. The author was adopted into a loving home, which provided a stable environment. The mother's return after years of absence and the revelation of her past drug use during pregnancy adds to the trauma. The author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as a protective measure, given the history. \n\nHowever, the mother is now trying to reconnect, expressing remorse and seeking a relationship. The author's complete lack of response over four years might be viewed as harsh, especially if the mother is genuinely trying to make amends. But considering the author's trauma and the fact that the mother was absent for so long, the author's feelings of not being able to forgive or love her are understandable. \n\nLegal and emotional boundaries are important here. The mother was legally prohibited from contacting the author until 18, but the emotional impact of her absence and the reasons behind it (drug abuse, neglect) are significant. The author's struggle with identity and the mother's inability to provide answers might have caused lasting pain. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond, especially if they feel it's not the right time or if they need space. The fact that the mother is now clean and trying to connect is positive, but the author's right to set boundaries must be respected. The mother's actions don't negate the author's right to feel disconnected. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding, as healing and rebuilding trust take time, if at all possible.\n"
