My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a really tough childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were six. They were put in foster care and then adopted by loving parents. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she reached out via Facebook, but the author felt she didn't answer their questions about their identity and past. The mom is now trying to reconnect, saying she's clean and wants to be part of their life, but the author can't bring themselves to respond with love.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they might be, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother did abandon them and had serious issues, which caused the author a lot of pain and confusion. The author is now an adult and has the right to set boundaries. They might not be ready to reconcile, especially if the mother didn't provide the closure or answers they needed. On the other hand, the mother is trying to make amends, and the author's silence might be hurting her. But the author's decision is about their own emotional well-being.\n\nI think the key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's past actions, and the author's current emotional state. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but because they can't emotionally connect to her as a mother. They've had to deal with a lot of trauma and uncertainty. It's important to validate that experience. The mother's actions in the past were harmful, and the author's response is a reflection of their need to protect themselves. So, in this context, the author isn't in the wrong for not reciprocating love right now. They have the right to take time to heal and decide their relationship. So the answer should be B.\n"
