My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hasn't responded to their mom's texts for four years. The mom sends messages saying she loves them, wishes them a happy birthday, etc., but the author never replies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a very difficult childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they were 18. When she did contact them, the author felt a mix of emotions but now sees her as a stranger. The author is struggling with forgiveness and whether they are in the wrong for not responding.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's past actions, and the author's current feelings of disconnection. The mother is now trying to reestablish a relationship, but the author feels they can't love her back because she's a stranger. The question is whether the author is wrong for not responding.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, this is a sensitive situation. The mother's past actions were severe, but she's since changed her life, is clean, and is trying to make amends. The author's lack of response could be seen as cutting off contact, which might be justified given the history. However, completely ignoring messages without any communication could be seen as harsh, even if the author has legitimate reasons. But the author's experience of trauma and lack of a real relationship might make their response understandable.\n\nThe concept of being in the \"wrong\" usually involves violating social norms or harming someone intentionally. Here, the author is not harming their mom; they're just not responding. The mom initiated contact after years of absence, and the author is dealing with unresolved trauma. The author's decision is about their personal boundaries and emotional healing. While it's painful for the mom, the author has the right to set boundaries based on their past. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
