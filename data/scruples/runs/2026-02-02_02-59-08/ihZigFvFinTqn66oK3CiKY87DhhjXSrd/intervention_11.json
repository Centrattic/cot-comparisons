My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated. The mom was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse, forcing her to leave the state. They couldn't contact each other until the author turned 18. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond and feels they can't love her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a foster home and adopted, so their relationship with their biological mom is broken because of the legal and personal issues. The mom's past actions led to a forced separation. When she reaches out, the author is struggling with their identity and the trauma of abandonment. The mom's behavior, using drugs during pregnancy and neglect, caused significant harm.\n\nThe author's response is to ignore the messages. They feel a lack of trust and closure. They might not be ready to reconnect, especially since the mom's presence in their life is still causing emotional pain. The author's adoptive parents provided a stable environment, which is important. The author is dealing with the aftermath of abuse and neglect, so their inability to reciprocate love isn't just about being ungrateful; it's about deep-seated emotional scars.\n\nSociety often expects people to forgive and reconnect, especially in parent-child relationships. But in cases of severe neglect or abuse, the emotional impact can be so profound that forgiveness isn't possible or healthy. The author might be protecting themselves from further emotional harm by not engaging. The mom's messages, while well-intentioned, might be triggering for the author, reminding them of the trauma they endured.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that ignoring someone who is trying to reconnect is harsh, especially if the person has changed. However, the author's trauma isn't something that can be easily overcome. The fact that the mom didn't know the father and couldn't provide information about the author's heritage adds to the complexity. The author's need for answers wasn't met, leading to more confusion and pain.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are dealing with the consequences of their mother's actions and are in a healing process. Their decision to not respond is a form of self-preservation. It's important to validate their feelings and the trauma they've experienced. The answer should reflect that their actions are a response to a long history of neglect and abuse, making them not the asshole in this situation.\n"
