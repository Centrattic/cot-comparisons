My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The author had a difficult childhood, with their mom being arrested for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in foster care and adopted, which I assume was a positive change. Now, after turning 18, the mom has tried to reconnect, but the author hasn't responded.\n\nFirst, I need to weigh the context. The author's mom was absent for most of their life due to legal issues and drug addiction. That's a significant factor. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect, given the trauma and lack of prior contact. The mom's attempts to reach out now might be genuine, but the author's feelings of not knowing her and the pain from the past are real. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is expressing regret and trying to be part of the author's life. But the author might feel it's too late, and they can't just suddenly form a bond. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. \n\nI think the key here is the author's perspective. They were a victim of abuse and neglect, and the sudden reconnection might not feel right. Their decision to not engage isn't about being cruel but about protecting themselves emotionally. Society often looks at family bonds as something that should be maintained, but in cases of abuse or neglect, those bonds can be complicated. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding, as they are dealing with past trauma and may need time or not want to reconcile. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
