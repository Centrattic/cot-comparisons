My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The author hasn't returned any love or messages, and the context is pretty heavy.\n\nFirst, the author had a tough childhood. Their mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse when they were 6. They were in foster care and later adopted by their current parents, whom they love. At 18, the mom reconnected via Facebook, but the conversation was painful because she couldn't answer the author's questions about their identity. Now, the mom sends messages, but the author doesn't respond, feeling she's a stranger despite her claims of being clean and repentant.\n\nThe key points here are the author's past trauma and the lack of a current relationship. The mom's actions in the past caused significant harm, leading to a long separation. The author's decision not to engage might stem from unresolved pain and not having built a relationship with her since recontact. The author might feel that the mom's attempts now don't erase the past. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying to make amends and deserves a chance. But considering the author's experience, it's understandable they're hesitant. They weren't given a choice in the past; now they're asserting control over their emotional boundaries. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If we look at intent, the author isn't ignoring out of spite but due to emotional barriers from a traumatic past. The mom's outreach might not have been sufficient to rebuild trust. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's actions are a response to their history, not malice.\n"
