My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother had a troubled past. She was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. The author was placed in foster care and later adopted. This is significant because it shows the mother wasn't present in the author's life growing up. The mother wasn't allowed to contact the author until they turned 18. After that, she reached out via Facebook, but the conversation didn't go well. The author felt the mother didn't provide the closure or answers they needed, like who their biological father is or their nationality. The mother admitted to drug use during pregnancy, which probably hurt the author. Since then, the mother sends messages of love and support, but the author doesn't respond. The author feels the mother is a stranger now and can't bring themselves to love her back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's past actions, the author's history of trauma and neglect, and the emotional distance that's developed. The author isn't responding to messages, but given their history, it's understandable they might not want to engage. The mother is reaching out, but the author isn't in a place to accept that. The author isn't ignoring the mother without reason; they have valid emotional reasons stemming from years of absence and the traumatic circumstances.\n\nThe options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering the context, the author's actions are a reaction to their past experiences. They aren't being cruel without cause. The mother's outreach is positive, but healing takes time, and the author's decision to not respond is their way of managing their emotional well-being. The situation isn't black and white, but the author's reasons are rooted in legitimate pain and neglect. So, the answer would be B.\n"
