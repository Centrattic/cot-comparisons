My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty heavy. The author had a difficult childhood, their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to them being placed in foster care. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, she admitted to using crack during pregnancy and not knowing certain things about the author's heritage. Now the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels they can't love her back because they see her as a stranger.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a traumatic experience with their mother abandoning them, legal issues, and being in foster care. The mom's actions had a significant impact on their life. The author's choice to not respond could stem from unresolved trauma, anger, or a protective mechanism. They might not be ready to forgive or reconnect, which is a personal decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to reach out, express regret, and wants to be part of the author's life. Not responding could be seen as cutting off a parent, which might be considered harsh. But given the history, it's more complicated. The author's emotional response is valid given their past. They might not feel obligated to reciprocate love or messages if they haven't processed their feelings yet. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, this is more about personal feelings and healing. The author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for not responding if they're not ready. They have the right to set boundaries. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the author's current actions are a reaction to that. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). They're dealing with complex emotions and a painful history, which affects their current behavior.\n"
