My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're an a**hole for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated. \n\nFirst, the mom had a lot of issues when the author was a kid. She was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, which led to the author being put in foster care and then adopted by someone else. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, it was emotional but also left the author with a lot of unanswered questions and unresolved feelings.\n\nThe author's adoptive parents are described positively, so they probably have a good support system. The mom, on the other hand, has a history of substance abuse, left them, and wasn't there during their formative years. Even now, she's trying to rebuild the relationship, but the author feels like a stranger to her. They don't return her messages because they can't find it in themselves to love her back.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the mother's past actions, the author's right to emotional boundaries, and the nature of their current relationship. The mother's history of neglect and drug use caused significant harm, and the author's trauma might make it hard to reconnect. Also, the author might feel that the mother didn't fulfill her parental duties, so it's reasonable to have anger or resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to make amends, and not responding to messages could be seen as cutting off a potential relationship. But considering the author's perspective, they have valid reasons for not wanting to engage. They might need time to process or might not feel it's their responsibility to reach out when the mother was absent for so long. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's decision to not respond is justified given the circumstances. Since they have a history of trauma and the mother wasn't part of their life when it mattered most, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're dealing with complex emotions and past trauma, which makes their stance understandable.\n"
