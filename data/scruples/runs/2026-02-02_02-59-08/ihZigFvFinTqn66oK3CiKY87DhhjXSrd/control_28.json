My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages over four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the background. The mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she reached out via Facebook, and the author had a lot of questions. However, the mom wasn't able to provide clear answers, and the author felt let down. Since then, the mom sends messages of love and support, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abandonment, the legal separation, the emotional trauma from discovering the mother's past, and the current lack of communication from the author. The author feels justified in not responding because they view the mother as a stranger despite her efforts to reconnect.\n\nI should think about whether the author is obligated to respond to their mother's messages. The mother has expressed remorse and is trying to rebuild the relationship, but the author has valid reasons for their distance. Emotional readiness to reconnect often takes time, especially after such a traumatic separation. The author's decision to not engage might be a protective measure rather than a malicious one.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is making efforts and deserves a response. However, considering the context of the author's upbringing and the lack of closure or answers, it's understandable that the author is hesitant. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but due to unresolved feelings and the complexity of their relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation is more about the author's emotional state and past experiences rather than a clear moral wrong. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author's current behavior is a reaction to that history. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to respond, especially if they haven't found a way to reconcile their feelings yet.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic childhood and have the right to set boundaries until they're ready to engage.\n"
