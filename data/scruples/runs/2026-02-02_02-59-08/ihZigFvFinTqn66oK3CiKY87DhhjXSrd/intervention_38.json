My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person hasn't responded to their mom's love texts for four years. The mom is reaching out, sending messages of love, birthday wishes, etc., but the author doesn't respond. The backstory is pretty heavy: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, forced to leave the state, couldn't contact them until they turned 18. Then she contacts them via Facebook, but the author feels disconnected and hasn't spoken to her since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in foster care and adopted, so their relationship with their birth mother was cut off legally for a long time. When the birth mother reentered their life, the author had a lot of unanswered questions and unresolved feelings. The mom admits to drug use during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity, which adds to the emotional complexity.\n\nThe author's non-response could be seen as a way of dealing with their own trauma and not being ready to reconnect. On the other hand, the mom is trying to reach out, showing she's trying to make amends. The author might feel that the mother abandoned them, so not responding is a form of self-protection. But some might argue that the author is cutting off a potential relationship without giving it a chance, even though the mother has her faults.\n\nI think the key points are the trauma the author experienced, the mother's past actions, and the author's current emotional stance. The author isn't rejecting the mom for trivial reasons; it's rooted in deep emotional wounds. The mom is trying to reach out, but the author hasn't had the opportunity to build a relationship with her. So, is the author being an asshole by not responding? Or is it understandable given their history?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But the author isn't being cruel or ignoring for selfish reasons. They're dealing with past trauma and not ready to reconnect. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
