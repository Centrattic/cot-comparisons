My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages over four years. Their mom was arrested when they were 6 for neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and adoption. After turning 18, the mom contacted them, but they haven't spoken much since. The mom sends affectionate texts, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had a significant absence in their life, which caused trauma. The author was in foster care and adoption, which is a major upheaval. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels disconnected, seeing her more as a stranger. The author's emotional distance is understandable given the history. They have valid reasons for not wanting to engage emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to rebuild the relationship. However, the author isn't obligated to reciprocate love or even respond if they feel it's not safe or healthy for them. The author's mental health and emotional well-being are important. They might need time, space, or even to cut off contact if that's what's best for them. The fact that they're processing all this and haven't responded isn't necessarily wrong. It's a complex situation where past trauma affects current interactions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They have a right to set boundaries based on their experiences. The answer should be B.\n"
