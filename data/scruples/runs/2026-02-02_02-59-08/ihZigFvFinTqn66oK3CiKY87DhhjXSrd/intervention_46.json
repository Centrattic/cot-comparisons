My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The mom was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was in foster care and then adopted by a different family. They couldn't contact their mom until they turned 18.\n\nSo after turning 18, the mom reached out, and the author had a lot of questions but felt let down by the answers. Now, the mom sends texts expressing love and missing them, but the author doesn't respond. The author feels like the mom is a stranger, so they can't return the love. \n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the history of abandonment, the mom's past actions leading to the child being taken away, and the author's emotional response. The author's lack of response could be due to emotional trauma and justified anger or hurt. The mom is clean now and trying to reconnect, but the author's experience was traumatic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, we often look at both sides. The mom's actions caused harm, and the author's reaction is a result of that. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond if they feel it's not right for them. The text mentions that the author hasn't spoken to her since the initial contact, which was emotionally difficult. \n\nSo, the author's decision not to respond might be a form of self-protection. They might not be in the wrong because the root cause is the mom's previous actions. The mom's current efforts might not be enough to bridge the gap created by her past. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
