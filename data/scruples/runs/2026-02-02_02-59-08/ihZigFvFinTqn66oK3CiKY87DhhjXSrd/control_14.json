My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The backstory is pretty intense: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being in a foster home and then adopted. The mom couldn't contact the author until they turned 18. Now, she's reaching out, expressing love and regret, but the author isn't responding. They feel hurt and disconnected because the mom didn't know their father or other details about their heritage, and the mom's past actions caused a lot of pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had a significant absence in their life due to legal issues and addiction. The author was adopted into a different family and has built a life with them. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author is emotionally closed off. The author isn't ignoring the mom without reason; there's deep-seated trauma and a lack of emotional connection. The mom's actions led to their separation, and the author is struggling with forgiveness and acceptance.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. From a moral standpoint, ignoring messages that express love and regret might seem harsh, but the author's history with their mother complicates things. The author isn't rejecting the mother out of spite but because of genuine emotional barriers. They were neglected and then lost for years. The mother's current efforts are sincere, but the author's hurt is valid. \n\nIn many cases, people need time to process such a history. The author isn't a bad person for needing that space. They have every right to feel conflicted. The mother's actions were harmful, and healing isn't linear. The author isn't being inconsiderate without cause. They're dealing with a complex mix of emotions, including anger, confusion, and maybe even guilt. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author's actions are a response to deep personal trauma and the absence of a meaningful relationship. They aren't ignoring the mother out of malice but because they haven't reconciled their feelings yet.\n"
