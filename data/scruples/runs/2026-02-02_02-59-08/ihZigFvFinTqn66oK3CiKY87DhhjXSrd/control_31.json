My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're an a**hole for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. Their mom had a rough past, was arrested when they were six, and couldn't contact them until they were 18. The user was adopted and has a good relationship with their adoptive parents.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect and abuse by the biological mom, the sudden reconnection after years of separation, and the user's emotional response. The user hasn't responded to their mom's messages because they feel she's a stranger now. They mention she didn't know things about their father or heritage, which added to their hurt.\n\nI need to consider if the user is in the wrong. Well, they were neglected as a child, which is a serious issue. The mother's actions had legal consequences, and she couldn't contact them until they were an adult. Now, she's trying to reconnect, but the user hasn't responded. But is that wrong?\n\nIt's about healing and emotional readiness. The user isn't obligated to respond if they feel hurt. They have the right to set boundaries. The fact that they were in foster care and adopted might also play a role in their current feelings. The mother's actions in the past have caused lasting trauma, so the user's hesitation is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother is trying to make amends and deserves a chance. But given the severity of the neglect and the user's justified trauma, it's not about being in the wrong but rather about their right to protect their emotional well-being. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
