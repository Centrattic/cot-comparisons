My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The mom sends messages expressing love, birthday wishes, encouragement, etc., but the author never responds. The backstory is that when the author was 6, their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom was legally barred from contacting the author until they turned 18. After turning 18, the mom contacted them via Facebook, but the author found out that the mom didn't know basic things about their father or their nationality. The mom has since been clean and found religion, but the author feels disconnected and can't return love.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had a troubled past and was absent for most of their life. The author was in foster care and then adopted, which likely affected their relationship with their biological mother. The mom was legally restricted from contacting the author until 18, so there's a long gap in their relationship. When they reconnect, the author is seeking information about their identity, but the mom couldn't provide it. The author feels let down and disconnected, hence not responding to the mom's messages.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abandonment, the legal separation, the sudden contact after 18, and the author's emotional response. The author isn't ignoring the mom out of malice but due to unresolved trauma and feelings of being a stranger to each other. The mom, while trying to reconnect, might not understand the author's emotional barriers.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The mom is trying to reach out, so the author's silence could be seen as cutting off a parent. However, the author has a history of neglect and abandonment. The trauma from being taken away and the mom's drug use during pregnancy could contribute to the author's inability to reconnect. The author might not feel ready, and it's not necessarily a matter of being in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their emotional distance.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom has made efforts to reconnect and maintain contact, and the author's silence might be hurting her. But the author's perspective is that the mom is a stranger, and the emotional disconnect is real. The author's right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic history, is important here. The author isn't ignoring the mom for no reason; it's due to a lifetime of pain and disconnection.\n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's not a simple yes or no. However, given the context, the author's actions are a result of their past trauma and the lack of a genuine relationship. They might not have the capacity to reciprocate feelings right now, which isn't their fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
