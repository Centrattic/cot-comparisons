My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. She was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the author until they were 18. When they reconnected, the mother admitted she was using crack cocaine during pregnancy, didn't know the father, etc. The author feels hurt and doesn't connect emotionally, so they don't respond to her messages. Now, the mom keeps sending love texts, but the author doesn't reply. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the author's reasons are rooted in past trauma and a complicated relationship. They were in foster care and adopted, so their current family is the one who raised them. The mother's return is recent, and the author is struggling with acceptance. They mention the mother is a stranger now, so not responding might be their way of coping.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to reconnect. But the author's non-response could be seen as cutting her off, which might be seen as harsh. But considering the history of abandonment and betrayal, the author has valid reasons for being distant. They're not ignoring her out of spite but because they have unresolved feelings and pain. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If someone is in a difficult emotional state and hasn't reconciled their past, it's not necessarily wrong to not respond. The mother's actions had legal consequences and caused long-term harm. The author's boundaries are understandable, even if the mother is trying to mend things. So, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author has legitimate reasons for not engaging and isn't being malicious.\n"
