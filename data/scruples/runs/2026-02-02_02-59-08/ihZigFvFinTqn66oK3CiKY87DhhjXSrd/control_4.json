My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they're the asshole for not returning their mom's love messages for four years. \n\nFirst, the background: The author was in foster care and adopted by a family they love. Their biological mom was arrested for neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, and couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did reach out, it was emotional, but the mom couldn't provide answers about their father or heritage, and admitted to drug use during pregnancy. Since then, the mom has been clean and religious, reaching out with messages of love and regret. The author hasn't responded, feeling she's a stranger now.\n\nSo, the key points here. The mom was legally prevented from contacting the author until they were 18, which is a significant part of the author's life. The author's current feelings are that the mom is a stranger, and they can't find it in themselves to love her back. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the author is hurt and hasn't responded to her messages.\n\nIs the author wrong for not responding? Well, they have a right to feel the way they do. The mom was absent for most of their life due to legal reasons, and when she reappeared, she couldn't provide the answers the author was seeking. The author's adoptive parents are important, and they've built a life with them. The author's decision not to engage could be a result of the trauma and lack of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is trying to rebuild the relationship, showing remorse and being clean. But the author isn't obligated to respond. They might be processing their emotions and dealing with the complexity of their feelings towards someone who was absent and then shows up with a different persona. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. They might need time to heal and decide if they want to reconnect. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might say that family bonds are important, but others understand that trust and safety are crucial. The author's mental health and emotional well-being should be a priority. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. They're dealing with a complicated situation that's deeply personal. So the answer should be B.\n"
