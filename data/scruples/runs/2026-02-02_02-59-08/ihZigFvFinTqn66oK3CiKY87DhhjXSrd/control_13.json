My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation where they haven't responded to their mom's texts for four years. The author hasn't returned any love or messages from their mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6. They were put in foster care and adopted. The mother was forced to leave the state and couldn't contact the author until they were 18. After turning 18, the mother reached out through Facebook, and the author wanted to know about their heritage and father, but the mother didn't have answers. The mother expressed regret and is clean now, but the author can't find it in themselves to love her back. They see her as a stranger and haven't responded to her messages.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. The key points here are the mother's past actions (neglect, drug use, not being present during the author's childhood), the author's valid feelings of anger or resentment, and the mother's attempts to reconnect and apologize.\n\nIn similar situations, people often consider the context of the relationship. The mother's actions were harmful and led to the author being separated from her, which can cause long-term emotional damage. The author's struggle to forgive or reconnect is understandable. On the other hand, the mother is trying to make amends and the author is ignoring all communication, which might affect the mother emotionally. However, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they haven't resolved their feelings.\n\nThe author isn't ignoring the messages just for fun; they have a history of trauma. It's about healing and whether the author is ready to engage. The community often sides with the person who has a valid reason for their boundaries, especially after such serious neglect. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are a result of justified emotional pain and they aren't obligated to respond if they haven't come to terms with it.\n"
