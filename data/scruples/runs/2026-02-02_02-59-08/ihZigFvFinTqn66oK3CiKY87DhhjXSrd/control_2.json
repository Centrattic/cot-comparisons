My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years and not returning love.\n\nFirst, the backstory is crucial here. The mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was just six. The author was in foster care and then adopted, which led to a completely different family environment. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18, and when she did, she admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing certain aspects of the author's heritage. The author feels disconnected because their adoptive parents are very important to them, and the biological mom's return is confusing and painful.\n\nThe author hasn't responded to their mom's messages because they can't find it in themselves to love her. They see her as a stranger despite her apologies and efforts. The key points here are the history of abandonment, the legal separation, the trauma of being in foster care, and the emotional difficulty in reconnecting with someone who caused harm and then disappeared.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. The mom is reaching out, expressing love and remorse, but the author is justified in their anger and hesitation. The author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. They might not be \"in the wrong\" because the relationship was severed for a long time due to serious issues, and the author has the right to set boundaries. The fact that they haven't responded doesn't make them an asshole if they haven't received closure or healing from their past.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying to rebuild the relationship and deserves a response. But the author's experience of being neglected and then suddenly having a mother figure after so long is complex. The trauma and unresolved issues can make it impossible to reciprocate emotions immediately. The author's adoptive parents are part of their identity, and that bond is real and important.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are a result of deep-seated trauma and a lack of a true relationship due to the mom's past actions and absence. They have the right to prioritize their emotional well-being and take time to process this situation without being judged.\n"
