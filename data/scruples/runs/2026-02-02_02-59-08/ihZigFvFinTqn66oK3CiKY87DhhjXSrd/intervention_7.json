My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love texts for four years. The context provided is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a history of child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being in foster care and then adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. When she did reach out, she was honest about her past and her addictions. Now she's clean and trying to reconnect, but the author won't respond emotionally. They feel disconnected and can't find it in themselves to love her back.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the mom is trying to rebuild a relationship after a long absence and a troubled past. The author's reasons for not responding are rooted in trauma and a lack of a real connection. They were raised by adoptive parents who they love, and their biological mom is essentially a stranger. The author isn't ignoring her out of malice but because they can't reconcile their feelings. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't obligated to have a relationship with someone who caused them trauma. It's about their emotional well-being. While it might be seen as harsh by some, given the context, it's understandable. The mom's actions in the past were harmful, and the author is prioritizing their own healing. So, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
