My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them ignoring their mom's messages for 4 years. The background is complicated: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being in foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until age 18, and when she did, she admitted to using drugs during pregnancy and not knowing the author's father. Now the mom sends messages expressing love, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history of abandonment and trauma. They were taken away as a child and not allowed to contact their mother for years. The mother's past actions caused significant harm. The author is now an adult and has mixed feelings about reconnecting. They feel the mother is a stranger now, even though she's trying to make amends.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions versus the author's current feelings. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of spite; it's due to unresolved trauma and the fact that the mother wasn't present during their upbringing. The author is struggling with whether they can forgive or accept the mother's attempts to reconnect after so much time and the harm done.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at intent. The author isn't being cruel or intentionally hurtful; they're dealing with their own emotions. The mother's actions were harmful in the past, but she's trying to reach out now. However, the author isn't obligated to respond if they're not ready. The issue is whether the author is wrong for not engaging.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons rooted in their past experiences. The mother's actions were part of a legal and personal crisis that wasn't the author's fault. The author is now an adult and has the right to set boundaries. Not responding doesn't make them an asshole; it shows they're processing their feelings and dealing with the aftermath of a difficult history.\n"
