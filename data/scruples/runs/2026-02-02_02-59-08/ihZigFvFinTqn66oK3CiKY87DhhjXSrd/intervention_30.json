My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse. The author was placed in foster care and adopted. The mom couldn't contact the author until they turned 18. When they did, the mom reached out, but there were unresolved issues. The author feels hurt because the mom didn't know who the father was and had used drugs during pregnancy. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't responded.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider the emotional trauma the author has experienced. The mother abandoned them, which can lead to deep emotional scars. The author's reluctance to reconnect isn't just about not responding to messages; it's about processing years of abandonment and the hurt from the mother's actions. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be genuine, but the author has legitimate reasons to be closed off, especially given the history. It's possible the author is still healing and hasn't found closure. From an outsider's perspective, the author isn't obligated to respond if they feel it's not in their best interest. The mother's actions, even if she's changed, caused lasting harm. The author's decision to not engage could be a form of self-protection. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
