My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the author had a really rough start. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6, leading to them being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they were 18. When she did reach out, the author found out that their mom didn't even know their father or nationality, which probably added to the emotional pain. \n\nNow, the mom is trying to reconnect, saying she's clean, found faith, and is sorry. She sends texts expressing love and missing them, but the author doesn't respond. The author feels conflicted because they can't bring themselves to love her back. They see her as a stranger.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, considering the history, the mom abandoned them due to serious issues, leading to the author being separated from her for most of their life. The author's feelings of not being able to reciprocate love might be a result of that trauma. They might be protecting their emotional well-being by not engaging. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is making efforts to reconnect, and the author isn't even acknowledging her attempts. But the key here is the context of their relationship. The author wasn't the one who cut off the relationship initially; their mom did when she was arrested. The author had no contact for years until after 18. The mom's approach might be a genuine effort to rebuild, but the author's emotional response is understandable given the history. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't being cruel or ignoring someone who was a regular, supportive presence. The mom's absence was forced by legal issues and personal struggles, and the author's reluctance to reconnect isn't out of spite but unresolved trauma. So, I think the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
