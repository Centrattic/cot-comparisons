My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. The mom had a troubled past, including child neglect and drug use, which led to her being separated from the author when they were young. After turning 18, the author reconnects but feels disconnected and can't muster love or respond to messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions as a parent were harmful and led to the child being placed in foster care and adoption. The author has a different family now, which has been supportive. The mother's attempts to reconnect come after years of absence, and the author feels conflicted about these overtures. The author isn't ignoring out of malice but because of unresolved trauma and the mother's past actions.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's history of neglect and the resulting emotional distance. The author isn't refusing to communicate entirely but isn't reciprocating affection. The mother is trying to reach out, but the author hasn't formed a bond with her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding emotionally or engaging in the relationship.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on intent and circumstances. The author isn't being cruel; they're dealing with past trauma and a complicated relationship. The mother's actions in the past were significant, so the author's reluctance isn't unreasonable. The author is prioritizing their emotional well-being and the family that raised them. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author's behavior stems from valid emotional reasons and past experiences.\n"
