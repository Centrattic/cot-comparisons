My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages for four years. The key points here are the history between the author and their mother.\n\nFirst, the mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted. The mother was legally barred from contact until the author turned 18. When they reconnected, the mother admitted to drug use during pregnancy and being unsure about the author's father and heritage. The author feels hurt and disconnected, seeing the mother as a stranger despite her efforts to reach out now.\n\nThe author hasn't responded to messages expressing love and support. The question is whether this makes the author the asshole. On one hand, the mother has a history of abandonment and substance abuse, which can impact the author's ability to trust or feel love. On the other hand, the mother is now trying to rebuild the relationship, and the author's silence might be seen as cutting her off without giving her a chance to make amends.\n\nBut considering the trauma and lack of a prior relationship, the author's reluctance is understandable. They have the right to set boundaries, especially if they haven't processed their feelings yet. The mother's actions in the past caused significant harm, and healing takes time. The author isn't obligated to respond immediately or reciprocate love without working through their emotions first. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author's emotional response is valid given the circumstances.\n"
