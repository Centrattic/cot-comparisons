My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's love texts for four years. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The mother was arrested when the author was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. She left the state, couldn't contact the child until the author turned 18. Then, after reconnecting, the mother sent messages expressing love and remorse, but the author hasn't responded. The author feels conflicted\u2014wants to know about their heritage but can't find it in their heart to love her back. They're ignoring the messages, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nFrom an empathy standpoint, the author's experience is traumatic. Being taken away at a young age, in foster care, then adopted. The mother's absence is significant. When they reconnect, the mother's lack of answers and the author's emotional turmoil makes sense. The author isn't in the wrong for not returning love immediately. Healing takes time. The mother's actions in the past caused harm, so the author's hesitation is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is reaching out, showing remorse, and trying to rebuild. The author's complete silence might be seen as cutting ties entirely. But given the history, maybe it's a necessary boundary. The author is dealing with complex emotions and trying to protect themselves. They might not be ready for reconciliation yet.\n\nI think the key here is the context of the past trauma. The author isn't being inconsiderate without reason. They have valid reasons for their emotional distance. So, they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
