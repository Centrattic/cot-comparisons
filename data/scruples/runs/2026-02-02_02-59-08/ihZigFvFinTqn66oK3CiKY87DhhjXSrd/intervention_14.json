My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for ignoring their mom's texts. The backstory is that the mother was arrested when the user was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the user being put in foster care and eventually adopted by a different couple. The mom couldn't contact them until the user turned 18. After that, she reached out via Facebook, but the user found out she didn't even know who the father was or their nationality. The user is now not returning her messages and feels she's a stranger who calls herself their mom.\n\nThe user is struggling with not being able to love her back. They mention she's clean and found religion, but he can't reconcile the past. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are but wants others' opinions.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mother's actions: she was neglectful, used drugs during pregnancy, left the state, and the child was adopted. The child had no contact with her for years, only two photos. Then, after 18, contact is re-established. The mother is expressing love and regret, but the child is hesitant, possibly due to trauma and lack of a real relationship.\n\nThe child isn't responding to messages. Is that wrong? Well, in terms of right and wrong, it's a complex emotional situation. The mother did wrong in the past, but the child has the right to feel hurt and disconnected. The child was adopted into a new family, which is their parents now. The biological mother is trying to re-enter the life, but the child may not feel responsible to reciprocate love or messages.\n\nIn many cases, people who were abandoned or neglected have a right to be cautious or even cut ties. The author isn't ignoring the messages out of malice but because of unresolved trauma and a lack of real connection. The mother, while expressing remorse, may not have earned the right to be included in the child's life again. The author's decision to not respond might be seen as self-protective rather than being in the wrong. However, some might argue that even if the relationship is strained, acknowledging the messages is a basic courtesy. But given the circumstances, the author's actions are more about their emotional well-being than being mean or inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons rooted in past trauma and the lack of a current relationship. They're prioritizing their own emotional health, which is understandable. The mother's actions were the cause of the initial pain, and the author isn't obligated to reciprocate love or messages they don't feel.\n"
