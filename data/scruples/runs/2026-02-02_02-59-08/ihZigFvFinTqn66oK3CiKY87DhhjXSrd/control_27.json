My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about ignoring their mother's texts for four years. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the background: the author was in a foster home, adopted by a different family. Their biological mother was arrested for neglect and drug abuse, which led to her leaving the state. They couldn't contact her until the author turned 18. When they did reconnect, the mother admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy and not knowing the father's identity. The author feels hurt and doesn't want to engage, hence not responding to her messages.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author wrong for not responding? Well, the mother did abandon them and had serious issues. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to reconnect. They might be dealing with trauma and trust issues. The mother's actions had severe consequences, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond immediately. On the other hand, the mother is trying to reach out, showing regret and wanting to be part of their life. But the author's hesitation is understandable given the history.\n\nThe key here is understanding the context. The author isn't being mean without reason; they have a history of neglect and abuse. Choosing not to engage isn't necessarily wrong because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. The mother's behavior in the past was harmful, so the author's reluctance isn't a sign of being an asshole but a reaction to their experiences.\n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic history. It's their choice to decide how and when to engage, if at all. The mother's actions were the main issue, not the author's current response.\n"
