My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hasn't been responding to their mom's love messages for four years after reconnecting after being separated due to the mom's past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the child being in foster care and adopted. The mom was legally prohibited from contacting the child until they turned 18. Upon reconnecting, the mom started sending messages but the child hasn't responded. The author feels conflicted but hasn't returned any love messages.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nKey points to consider: \n- The parent had serious past issues that led to the child's separation.\n- The child had a traumatic experience and was adopted by a new family they love.\n- The mother is now clean and trying to reconnect, but the child is struggling with their identity and the mother's role in their life.\n- The author hasn't responded to messages, which might seem heartless, but there's a history of abandonment and lack of parental presence.\n\nIn such cases, it's important to understand the emotional and psychological impact on the child. The author's decision not to respond could stem from unresolved trauma, fear of being hurt again, or difficulty in forming a relationship with someone who wasn't present during their upbringing. While the mother is making efforts to reconnect, the author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. It's about their emotional well-being and healing process.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether they're \"in the wrong.\" If we judge based on empathy and understanding of their situation, the author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with complex emotions and past trauma. The mother's actions in the past were indeed harmful, and the child has the right to take time or choose not to engage if it's not helpful for their recovery.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being harsh because the mother is trying to make amends. But considering the depth of the past issues and the child's need for time and space, the author's choice to not respond might be a healthy boundary. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
