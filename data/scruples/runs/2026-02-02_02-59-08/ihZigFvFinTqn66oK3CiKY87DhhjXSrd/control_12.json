My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person (let's call them the author) hasn't been responding to their mom's texts for four years. The mom sends messages expressing love and support, but the author doesn't respond. The backstory is pretty heavy: the mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was 6, leading to the author being in foster care and eventually adopted. The author was cut off from their mom until turning 18, and when they did reconnect, the mom's answers were unsatisfying and hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The mom's actions as a parent were severe and harmful. Abandoning a child, drug abuse, and neglect are significant issues that can cause lasting trauma. The author was raised by adoptive parents who loved them, which probably helped in their development. When the mom reconnected, she provided answers that the author wasn't ready for or didn't want to hear, leading to emotional pain.\n\nNow, the author's current behavior is not responding to messages. The mom is expressing love and trying to build a relationship, but the author feels unable to reciprocate. Is this the author's fault? Well, the author has valid reasons for their feelings. The mom's past actions created a rift, and the author's trauma might make it hard to form that emotional connection. The fact that the author hasn't been able to forgive or respond might stem from legitimate hurt and a need for space.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should make an effort to respond, even if they don't show love. After all, the mom is reaching out and expressing remorse. But considering the history, the author's right to set boundaries and protect their emotional well-being is important. They might not be ready for a relationship and that's okay. It's their own process, and they shouldn't be forced to show love when they can't.\n\nAnother angle: the mom's actions were her own, and while she's trying to make amends now, the author isn't obligated to accept her. The author's adoptive parents provided a loving environment, so maybe the author feels they don't need anything else from their biological mom. The author's struggle with identity and unanswered questions might also contribute to their inability to connect.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, some might say family should be prioritized, but others understand the complexity of such situations. The key here is that the author's lack of response isn't out of malice but due to unresolved trauma and a strained relationship. They're not ignoring the texts to be cruel but because they can't emotionally process it yet.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a history of neglect and abuse, and their current emotional state is a result of that. The decision to not respond is about self-protection and healing, not being an asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
