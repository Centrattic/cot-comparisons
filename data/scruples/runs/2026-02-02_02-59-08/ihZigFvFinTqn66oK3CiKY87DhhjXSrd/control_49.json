My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts. The situation is complicated. The mother had a history of drug abuse and neglect, leading to the child being put in foster care. They were separated for a long time, and when they reconnect, the author is hesitant to engage emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the background. The mother's past actions were harmful and led to the child's separation. The child was adopted by a loving family, which provided a stable environment. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels conflicted. They don't respond to her messages, not out of malice, but because of unresolved trauma and the fact that she's a stranger now. \n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the child's current emotional state, and the mother's attempts at reconciliation. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite; it's more about not being ready to reconnect. They have valid reasons for their hesitation. The mother's actions in the past were significant, and the author's choice to not engage is a form of self-protection. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their adoptive parents are the ones they love and consider family. The mother's attempts to re-enter their life might be seen as intrusion if the author isn't prepared. It's important to acknowledge that healing takes time, and the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond immediately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their actions are a result of past trauma and the need to protect their emotional well-being. The mother's behavior in the past is a major factor here, so the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
