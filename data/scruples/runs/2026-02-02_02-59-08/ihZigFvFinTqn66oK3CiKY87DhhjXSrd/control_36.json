My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the background: The author was taken from their mother at age 6 due to her drug abuse and neglect. They were put in foster care and then adopted by a loving family. The mom was legally barred from contacting them until they turned 18. When the author turned 18, the mom reached out via Facebook, but she couldn't provide answers about the author's heritage or father. The mom admitted to using crack cocaine during pregnancy. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond and is struggling with whether they're being an asshole.\n\nSo the key points here are the history of neglect, the mother's past actions, the author's trauma, and their current emotional response. The author is in their early 20s now, I assume, since they turned 18 recently. They've been ignoring their mom's messages for four years, but the mom is trying to reconnect. The author feels that their mom is a stranger, and they can't find it in themselves to respond or show love.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mom is trying to reconnect after making mistakes. On the other hand, the author has legitimate reasons to be upset and may not be ready to forgive. The author's actions are a form of emotional self-protection. They have the right to set boundaries, especially given the history. The mom, while remorseful, caused significant harm. The author isn't ignoring her out of spite but due to unresolved trauma and lack of trust.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, being an \"asshole\" usually implies acting unkindly without justification. Here, the author's actions are a response to past trauma. The mom is the one who caused harm, so the author isn't wrong for not wanting to engage. They're prioritizing their emotional well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
