My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. The author was then put in foster care and adopted by a new family. The mom was prohibited from contacting the author until they turned 18. After that, the mom reached out, and the author had many unanswered questions about their identity. The mom admitted to drug use during pregnancy and couldn't provide information about the father. Since then, the author hasn't spoken to her, even though the mom sends messages expressing love and regret. The author feels they can't love her back because she's a stranger.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of neglect, the legal separation, the traumatic experience of being in foster care, and the mom's past drug abuse. The author hasn't blocked her, just ignores the messages. The question is whether this is the author being in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the mom was absent for so long, caused harm, and now wants back into the author's life. The author has every right to feel hurt and not want to reconnect. The mom's actions led to the author being removed from her care, which is a significant betrayal. The author's decision to not respond could be seen as a form of self-protection, especially given the trauma involved.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is trying to make amends and deserves a response. But considering the history, it's understandable that the author isn't ready. The author is not cutting off the mom out of spite; they're maintaining distance because of past harm. The author's mental health and emotional well-being are important here. They might not be in a place to forgive or even acknowledge the mother's attempts, especially if there's unresolved pain.\n\nThe fact that the author has a loving adopted family also plays a role. Their current support system might be more important to them than a biological connection that was broken due to the mother's actions. The author's lack of response isn't about being ungrateful but about processing deep-seated issues from their past.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people often think that ignoring someone's love messages is wrong, but in this context, the author's situation is more nuanced. The trauma and neglect they experienced can't be easily reconciled with a few text messages. The author isn't obligated to reciprocate love or forgiveness, especially when it's not authentic. They have the right to set boundaries to protect their own mental health.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with the aftermath of significant personal and familial trauma. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
