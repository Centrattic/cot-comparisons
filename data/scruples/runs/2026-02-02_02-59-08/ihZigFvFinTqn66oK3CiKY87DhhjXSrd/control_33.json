My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts for four years. The background is that the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in foster care. At 18, the mother reconnected, but the author feels unresolved pain and doesn't want to reconnect, hence ignoring messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the mother's actions. She was involved in severe issues that led to legal consequences and the separation. The author was adopted by a new family, which provided a stable environment. The mother's return comes with apologies and attempts to reconnect, but the author is struggling with anger and a lack of trust.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and the author's right to set boundaries. The mother's past actions have caused lasting trauma, and the author is dealing with the emotional aftermath. Ignoring texts could be seen as a way to protect their emotional well-being, especially if the author hasn't been able to process their feelings yet. However, the mother is reaching out sincerely, expressing remorse, and the author's lack of response might be seen as cutting off a potential healing relationship.\n\nBut considering the severity of the mother's actions, the author isn't obligated to forgive or respond. The decision to not engage could be a personal boundary, which is their right. The question is whether that boundary is wrong. Since the mother's actions were harmful and the author hasn't had the time or ability to reconcile, it's reasonable for the author to not respond. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole). They are not in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional health after such trauma.\n"
