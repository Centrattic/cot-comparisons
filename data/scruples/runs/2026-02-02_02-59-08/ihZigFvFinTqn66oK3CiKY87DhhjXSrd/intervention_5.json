My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The author didn't return any love messages, birthdays, etc. The background is that the mom had a criminal history involving child neglect and drug use, which led to the author being placed in foster care and adoption. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18, and now she's trying to reconnect, but the author feels no connection and can't reciprocate love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had a significant role in their life being absent, especially during formative years. The author was in foster care and adopted, which might have caused trauma. Now, the mom is trying to reach out, but the author feels she's a stranger. The key here is whether not responding is wrong. \n\nThe mom is reaching out with positive intentions, expressing love and regret. The author's non-response could be seen as cutting off a potential relationship. However, the author's reasoning is valid\u2014they might not feel safe or able to trust their mom after the past. The author's trauma and the mom's past actions are critical factors. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if someone is choosing not to engage due to valid reasons (like past trauma and lack of trust), it's not necessarily their fault. However, some might argue that ignoring someone's attempts to connect could be seen as dismissive. But given the context, the author isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel comfortable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because their decision is influenced by valid past experiences and trauma. They aren't required to reconcile if it's not safe or healthy for them.\n"
