My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was taken from their mother when they were six due to her drug abuse and neglect. They were in foster care and adopted by a new family. After turning 18, the mother contacted them, apologized, but the author found out she didn't know their father or nationality, which was a big emotional hit. Now, the mother sends messages but the author doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's legal issues, the emotional trauma from being taken away, and the author's struggle to forgive. The mother is clean now and wants a relationship, but the author feels she's a stranger.\n\nThe question is whether not responding is wrong. The answer depends on understanding the situation. The author has valid reasons for not being able to show love or respond. They were wronged in the past, and it's natural to have trust issues. The mother's actions as a parent were harmful, and the author is dealing with the aftermath. Not responding doesn't make them an asshole because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. The mother's intentions might be good, but the author isn't in a place to engage. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
