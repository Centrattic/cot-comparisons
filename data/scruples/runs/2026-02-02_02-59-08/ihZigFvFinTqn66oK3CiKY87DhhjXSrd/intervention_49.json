My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The author has a complicated history with their mother, including neglect, drug abuse, and being separated as a child. They were adopted by a new family and reconnected with their biological mom after 18. The author isn't responding to her messages, not returning love, and the question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's past actions were harmful and legally problematic. The author was in foster care and then adopted, which is a significant trauma. The mother's return might be difficult because she wasn't part of the author's life growing up, and they have valid reasons to feel disconnected. The author's emotional response is understandable given the history.\n\nThe mother is now trying to connect, but the author feels they're strangers. The author isn't obligated to respond if they're not comfortable. It's about healing and setting boundaries. The mother's apologies and attempts to reconnect are good, but the author has the right to their feelings. The key here is whether not responding is wrong. Since the author has a history of neglect and the mother wasn't present, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not engaging. They're prioritizing their emotional well-being. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
