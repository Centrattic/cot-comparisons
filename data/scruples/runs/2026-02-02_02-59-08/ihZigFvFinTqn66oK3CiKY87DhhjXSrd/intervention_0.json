My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six. The author was then put in foster care and adopted. They didn't see their mom until they turned 18, and the mom reached out via Facebook. She expressed remorse, but the author found out she didn't know their father or nationality. The author hasn't spoken to her since and now isn't responding to her messages, even though she sends love and encouragement. The author feels conflicted because they don't know her well and can't bring themselves to love her back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had serious issues that led to the author being separated from her at a young age. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to connect, given the history of neglect and the mom's inability to provide answers. The author is still processing the past and hasn't been able to form a relationship with the mom despite her efforts to reach out and show regret.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect, the forced separation, the lack of information about the author's background, and the author's emotional response to the mom's messages. The author is struggling with feelings of betrayal and confusion, and hasn't been able to reconcile their feelings. The mom is trying to reconnect, but the author feels it's too soon or impossible.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue that the author is justified in their feelings. The mom did the unthinkable by being absent due to her actions, and the author has every right to be hurt and not want to engage. The author's decision not to respond is a personal choice based on their trauma and the lack of a real connection.\n\nHowever, some might say that the author should give the mom a chance to rebuild the relationship, even if it's slow. But the author is not denying the mom's efforts; they're just not reciprocating. The author's perspective is that the mom is a stranger, and they can't force themselves to love her. It's about their emotional well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the history and the author's justified emotional response, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The situation is complex, and the author's decision is rooted in their past experiences. They're not ignoring the mom out of spite but because they can't form an emotional connection yet. So the answer should be B.\n"
