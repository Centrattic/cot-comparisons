My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ignoring their mother's love messages for four years. The author has a complicated background where their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug use when they were 6, leading to their placement in foster care and adoption. After turning 18, the mom tried to reconnect, but the author hasn't responded beyond the initial contact and hasn't returned any affectionate messages since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional and psychological impact on the author. The mother's past actions caused significant trauma and separation. The author was taken from her and placed in a different home, which is a major disruption in a child's life. The fact that the mother used drugs during pregnancy adds another layer of harm. The author's hesitation to reconnect is understandable given the history of abandonment and lack of information about their biological father and heritage.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother has since cleaned up her act and is trying to reconnect, expressing regret and a desire to be part of the author's life. She's reached out through messages, which the author hasn't reciprocated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to these affectionate messages.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's past actions versus the author's current feelings and actions. The author isn't ignoring the mother out of malice but because of unresolved trauma and emotional distance. They've already received some information from the mother but chose not to maintain contact. The author's decision not to respond might be a way of protecting their emotional well-being.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and context. If someone is avoiding contact due to past trauma, they're generally seen as not in the wrong. The mother's perspective is about wanting to reconnect, but the author's perspective is about healing and safety. The author's actions are a result of their experiences and emotional state, not a lack of empathy or care.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not responding. They're dealing with the aftermath of significant neglect and abandonment, which makes it difficult to form or maintain a relationship with someone who caused them harm. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
