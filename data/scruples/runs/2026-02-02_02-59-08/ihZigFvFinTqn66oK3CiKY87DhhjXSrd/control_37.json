My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not responding to their mother's messages for four years. The backstory is pretty heavy: the mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to the author being placed in foster care and then adopted. The mother was cut off from contact until the author turned 18.\n\nSo, the author's mom reached out after all that time, expressing regret and wanting to reconnect. The author is struggling with their feelings because they don't know their mom anymore. They're hurt and confused, not sure about their identity, and can't bring themselves to respond with love or affection. The question is whether the author is wrong for not responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's actions were severe and had a lasting impact on the author. The author was taken from her when he was very young, and they were legally separated. Now, after 18, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author feels no connection. The mother's behavior in the past was harmful, and the author is dealing with the aftermath of that trauma.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a straightforward yes or no. The author isn't obligated to respond to their mother's messages if they feel it's too painful or if they don't feel a connection. The mother's actions were a major betrayal, and the author's feelings are valid. The fact that the author is struggling to find love or acceptance for someone who abandoned them isn't a moral failing. They have a right to their emotions and boundaries.\n\nHowever, some might argue that ignoring someone who is trying to reach out could be seen as harsh. But given the history, the author's decision to not respond is a form of self-protection. They're not ignoring out of spite but because of unresolved trauma and a lack of a relationship. The mother's attempts to reconnect might be genuine, but the author isn't in a place to reciprocate. \n\nIt's important to note that the author is not being mean or cruel; they're dealing with complex emotions. The mother's actions were wrong, and the author's current stance is a result of that history. There's no obligation to forgive or accept someone who caused significant harm without the person making genuine amends. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and setting boundaries.\n"
