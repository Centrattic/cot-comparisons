My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's love messages for four years. The author has a complicated background with their mom being absent due to legal issues and drug abuse. They were adopted by a different family and have grown up with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was absent for a significant part of the author's life, which is a major factor. The author's emotional response to reconnecting and discovering that the mother didn't even know certain details about their father or heritage might contribute to their feelings of not being able to reciprocate love. The mother, on the other hand, is trying to reconnect but the author feels she's a stranger now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to the mother's messages. The key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's past actions (narcotics, neglect), and the author's current emotional state. The author isn't ignoring out of malice but because of past trauma and lack of a real current relationship.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intent and circumstances. The author isn't being mean or cruel; they're dealing with unresolved feelings and a complex past. The mother is reaching out, but the author isn't in a place to respond. The author's actions are more about emotional boundaries than being a jerk. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
