My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The author has a complicated background. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when the author was six, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. After reconnecting, the author hasn't responded to her messages, even though she's clean now and expresses regret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was taken away from their mom due to her actions, which were severe enough to result in legal consequences. The author grew up in a different environment, with an adoptive parent they love. When they turned 18, they tried to reconnect but found out the mom had been using drugs during pregnancy and couldn't even identify their father. That's a lot to process. The author feels conflicted\u2014there's a biological connection, but the mom isn't really a mother figure to them. They might be struggling with forgiveness and trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is reaching out, trying to rebuild a relationship. She's clean and shows remorse. The author not responding could be seen as cutting off a parent, which is a traditional role in many cultures. But given the context, it's not a typical parent-child situation. The author was essentially a victim here, so expecting them to respond with love and affection might be unrealistic. They might need time or closure, especially if the information they received was painful. \n\nThe key factors here are the history of abuse and neglect, the author's right to set boundaries, and the mom's current efforts to reconnect. The author isn't rejecting her for no reason; there's a valid history of trauma. Even if the mom is trying to make amends now, the author isn't obligated to reciprocate immediately or at all. They might be dealing with complex emotions that aren't resolved easily. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at it from a standpoint of family obligations, maybe. But considering the circumstances\u2014child neglect, drug abuse during pregnancy, the author's need to process these revelations\u2014it makes sense why they might be distant. The mom's actions as a parent were harmful, so the author's reluctance isn't unfounded. It's about personal healing and setting boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
