My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mother was arrested when the author was six for child neglect and drug abuse. She left the state and couldn't contact them until the author turned 18. The author was adopted by other parents and grew up with them. After turning 18, the mother reached out, but when the author asked questions about their identity and past, the mother couldn't provide answers. Now, the mom sends messages of love and support, but the author doesn't respond, feeling that the mom is a stranger.\n\nThe author is struggling with whether they're the asshole for not responding. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nHmm. The key points here are the history of abandonment, the mother's legal issues and drug use, the author's trauma, and the current non-response. The mother has expressed regret and is clean now, but the author hasn't forgiven her. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, does the author have the right to be upset? Yes, considering the mother's past actions. The author was neglected and abandoned, which is a serious issue. The sudden contact after 18 years could be overwhelming. The author's decision to cut off contact might be a protective measure. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is trying to reconnect, expressing love and regret. The author's silence might seem cold, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The author isn't obligated to accept the mother back into their life. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? I think not. They've experienced trauma and have the right to set boundaries. The mother's actions in the past caused harm, so the author's non-response isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
