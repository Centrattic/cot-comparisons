My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user asks if the author is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author had a really tough childhood. Their mom was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. They were put in foster care and then adopted by a loving family. After 18, the mom tried to reconnect via Facebook. The author had a lot of questions about their identity and their mom admitted to using crack during pregnancy and not knowing their father. Now, the mom sends texts expressing love and support, but the author doesn't respond. They feel conflicted because they don't know who she is anymore, just that she's a stranger.\n\nHmm. The author is dealing with a lot of trauma and abandonment. Their mom was absent for most of their life, left them in foster care, used drugs during pregnancy, and now wants to reconnect. The author's silence could be a protective mechanism. They might not feel ready to engage due to past pain and betrayal. But the mom is reaching out, trying to show regret and love.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, cutting off all communication might seem harsh, but considering the context, it's a form of self-preservation. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic experience. They might not be ready to forgive or accept her back into their life. The mom's actions caused lasting harm, and the author's emotional distance is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a response, even if not affectionate, could acknowledge her efforts and set clear expectations. But the author's decision not to respond is their choice. They're not obligated to maintain a relationship with someone who caused them significant pain. The key here is the author's right to prioritize their healing and decide their own boundaries.\n\nSo, taking all that into account, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). Their actions are a result of deep-seated emotional trauma and the need to protect themselves from further hurt. It's a complex situation where the author's well-being is the primary concern.\n"
