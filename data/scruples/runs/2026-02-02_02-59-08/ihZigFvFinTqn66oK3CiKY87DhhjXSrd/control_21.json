My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. Their mom had a history of drug abuse, child neglect, and was absent during their childhood. The user was in foster care and adopted, which had a significant impact on their life. Now, after reconnecting when the user turned 18, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the user doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The mother's actions in the past were harmful and led to the child being separated. The user's trauma from being neglected and the mother's absence is a crucial factor here. The user's current lack of response could be a result of unresolved trauma and emotional barriers. It's possible they haven't forgiven her or felt safe enough to open up again.\n\nThen, looking at the current situation. The mother is trying to reconnect, showing remorse and seeking to be part of the user's life. However, the user feels disconnected because they don't know her and she's a stranger. The user's emotional response is valid given their history. They might not be ready for reconciliation, and it's their right to set boundaries. The mother's efforts are commendable, but the user's right to emotional distance can't be overlooked.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the question is whether the user is at fault. The mother's past actions are the main cause of the estrangement. The user's non-response isn't a lack of love necessarily, but a coping mechanism from past trauma. The user isn't ignoring her out of spite but due to deep-seated issues. So, it's not the user's fault. They have the right to protect their emotional well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
