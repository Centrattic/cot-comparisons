My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's texts over four years. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The person had a very difficult childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse when they were 6, leading to their placement in foster care and eventual adoption. The mom wasn't allowed to contact them until they turned 18. When she did, she reached out on Facebook, but the conversation left the person feeling let down because the mom couldn't provide answers about their heritage or father. Now, the mom sends messages expressing love and regret, but the person doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the question is, is the person in the wrong for not responding? Well, considering the context, they have a history of significant neglect and abandonment. Their mom wasn't part of their life for most of their childhood, and the recent attempts to reconnect haven't healed old wounds. The person is struggling with trust and emotional closure. They might feel that the mom's current expressions of love come too late, especially after years of absence and the trauma caused.\n\nEmotionally, it's understandable that they can't just accept the mom's apologies or love without reservations. The mom's presence was absent during critical developmental years, and the sudden contact might trigger unresolved feelings. The person's decision to not reciprocate is a form of self-protection. They're not ignoring her out of spite but because they need time, space, or maybe even closure that the mom hasn't provided.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is clean now, has found faith, and is trying to reconnect. But the child's right to emotional boundaries is valid. Love isn't a transaction; it's a choice that requires mutual respect and understanding. The mom's texts might be well-intentioned, but if they're causing emotional pain, the child isn't wrong for not engaging.\n\nLegally and ethically, the person isn't obligated to maintain a relationship with someone who caused them harm. Healing takes time, and the person's current stance is a reflection of their unresolved pain. They're not being cruel without reason; they're prioritizing their mental health and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the history of neglect, the sudden reconnection without adequate reconciliation, and the emotional impact on the person, the answer would be that they are not in the wrong. Their response is a legitimate way to handle complex family dynamics and personal trauma.\n"
