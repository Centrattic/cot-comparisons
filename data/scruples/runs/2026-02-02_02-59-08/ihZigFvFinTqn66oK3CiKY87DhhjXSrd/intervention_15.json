My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex. The author's mom had a troubled past, was arrested when the author was 6, and they were separated. The author was adopted and had a good upbringing. After turning 18, the mom reached out, but the conversation left the author feeling disconnected because the mom couldn't provide answers about their heritage. Now, the mom is trying to reconnect, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mom had a major role in their separation, which happened when the author was very young. The author's adoptive parents provided a stable environment. The mom's actions in the past caused the separation, and even though she's trying to make amends now, the author hasn't been able to reconnect emotionally. \n\nThe key points here are the mom's past actions and the author's emotional state. The author isn't ignoring messages out of spite but due to unresolved trauma and a lack of a real relationship. The mom re-entered their life with incomplete information and the author might feel that reconnecting isn't possible right now. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting off contact entirely without any communication could be seen as harsh, especially if the mom is genuinely trying to rebuild the relationship. But given the author's history and the emotional barriers they've described, it's understandable. The author isn't in a position to forgive or accept the relationship easily. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely depends on the intent behind the author's actions. If the author is intentionally ignoring messages to punish their mom or because they don't care, then maybe. But based on the backstory, it's more about emotional distance and unresolved issues. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're dealing with the aftermath of their mom's past actions and the resulting trauma. They're not refusing to acknowledge a relationship out of spite but because they haven't been able to form a bond. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
