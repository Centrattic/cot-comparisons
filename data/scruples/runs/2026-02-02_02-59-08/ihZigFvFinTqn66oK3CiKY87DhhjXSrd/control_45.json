My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's messages. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mother was arrested when they were 6 for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being in foster care and adopted. The mom was cut off from contact until the author turned 18. After that, when they reconnected, the author learned that the mom didn't even know who their father was and had been using drugs during pregnancy. The author now ignores the mom's messages, feeling that she's a stranger and can't forgive her past actions.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abandonment and abuse. The mother's actions led to the author being separated from her for most of their life, which is a significant trauma. The author's lack of response could be seen as a form of self-protection, given the past. The mother is now trying to reconnect, but the author hasn't forgiven her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother is trying to reach out, and not responding might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the author has a history of trauma and might feel that reconnecting is not possible right now. The author's boundaries here could be justified as a way to protect their own emotional well-being. \n\nIn cases like this, people often have different reactions based on their experiences. The author's decision not to respond might not be wrong, considering the circumstances. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
