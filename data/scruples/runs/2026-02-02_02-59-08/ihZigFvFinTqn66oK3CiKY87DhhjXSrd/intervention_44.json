My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's messages for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a very difficult childhood. Their mom was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, leading to the author being placed in foster care and eventually adopted by a different family. The mom couldn't contact the author until they were 18. When they did reconnect, the author felt ignored and unloved, but the mom had turned her life around, is clean, and wants to be part of the author's life. However, the author can't bring themselves to reciprocate love and ignores the messages.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the mom was absent for most of their life, didn't know their father, and was using drugs during pregnancy. They feel like a stranger now, even though the mom is trying to make amends. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, trauma and abandonment can deeply affect someone's ability to trust and form relationships. The author's experiences might make it hard to accept the mom's attempts at reconciliation. The mom's actions in the past caused significant harm, and the author is still processing that. It's important to consider the emotional impact of neglect and addiction on a child.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mom is now clean and making efforts to connect, so the author should respond with kindness. But others would say that the author has the right to set boundaries, especially after such a traumatic history. The author isn't obligated to forgive or respond immediately; healing takes time. The mom's messages might be well-intentioned, but the author's lack of response could stem from valid emotional barriers.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the author's trauma and the fact that they're still healing. They aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and not being ready to engage. The mom's actions don't negate the author's right to feel how they do. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
