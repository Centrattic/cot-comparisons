My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ignoring their mom's texts for four years. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom was arrested when the kid was 6 for child neglect and drug abuse. The kid was put in foster care and eventually adopted. The mom couldn't contact them until they turned 18. When she did contact, there was a lot of emotional stuff\u2014she admitted to using crack during pregnancy, didn't know the father, etc. The author feels conflicted. The mom texts them love and support, but the author doesn't respond.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not responding. On one hand, the mom is reaching out, showing she's trying to reconnect. But on the other hand, the author has a lot of unresolved trauma and a history of abandonment. They might not be ready to forgive or engage. The author mentions feeling like the mom is a stranger now. It's understandable that they are hesitant, especially given the mom's past actions and the lack of closure.\n\nThe key points here are the history of neglect and the recent attempts to reconnect. The author's decision not to respond could be seen as a form of self-protection. They might be dealing with emotional pain and not ready to reconnect. People in their situation might need time to process. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they have valid reasons for their actions based on their experiences. The mom's outreach is good, but the author's response is influenced by deep-seated issues that aren't that simple. It's not a clear-cut case of being in the wrong.\n"
