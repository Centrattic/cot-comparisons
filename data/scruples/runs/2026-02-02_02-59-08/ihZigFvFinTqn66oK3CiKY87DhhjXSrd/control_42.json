My mother lives in Nevada. I'm out here on the West Coast so of course messaging is the only way she can contact me. She tells me she loves me and she misses me, she tells me happy birthday and Merry Christmas. She gives me encouragement and tells me to stay strong, and I never say a word back.\n\nSome backstory:\n\n When I was 6, my mother was arrested for child neglect, drug abuse, and most likely other charges I'm too scared to ask about. She's been married once and has had 5 children with all different men. All but one of us never met our fathers. I was put in a foster home, and eventually adopted by a Native-American Ex-Marine father and African American mother of whom I love dearly.\n\nI grew up alright. I struggled with learning disabilities such as ADHD, mild medical issues, and did alright socially. Due to the legality of the arrest, my mom had been forced to leave the state and was not permitted to contact me until I was 18. Until then, the only thing I had to remember her by was two photos of us taken in a DHS office that I had nailed to my bedroom wall. \n\nA couple months after my 18 birthday she finally contacted me via Facebook. It was an extremely emotional experience. I wanted to know so much about myself: who my father was, what my nationality is, why did she have to leave, and small things like who's personality did I get? Hers or dad's? Do I have her eyes or my dad's nose? The more I asked the more I my heart sank. She didn't know my father. It was between multiple men. She didn't know my nationality either. She then told me how sorry she was, and how much she missed me. And told me she was abusing crack cocaine for years, even for 4 months during her pregnancy with me.\n\nI haven't spoken to her since. She's sweet I guess. She's clean, found her faith in the Christian Church. She tells me how much she regrets what she's done and how she wishes she could take it back, that she just wants to be part of my life. But I can't find it in me to love her back. She's a stranger to me. She calls herself my mom but I have no idea who she is. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not responding to their mother's texts over four years. The author was neglected by their biological mother, put into foster care, and adopted. The mother was arrested for child neglect and drug abuse, couldn't contact the author until they turned 18. Now she reaches out, expressing love and regret, but the author doesn't respond. They feel hurt and disconnected, seeing her as a stranger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's biological mother caused significant trauma and wasn't part of their life for most of their life. The author was placed in a stable environment with an adoptive family, which they love. Now, the mother is trying to reconnect, but the author is struggling with the past.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not responding? Well, the mother is reaching out, which is good, but the author has valid reasons for not reciprocating. They were harmed and neglected, and it's taken time to process. Emotional healing isn't linear. The fact that the author hasn't spoken to her since the initial contact might not be the issue here. The question is about ignoring texts for four years. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that they can't find it in themselves to love her back. They see her as a stranger. The mother's actions in the past have caused lasting effects. The author's adoptive parents provided a stable environment, which is crucial. The biological mother's attempts to connect are genuine, but the author is dealing with complex trauma and possibly unresolved feelings. \n\nIs ignoring the texts justified? Maybe. The author isn't obligated to respond if they don't feel ready. They might be setting boundaries to protect their emotional well-being. The mother's outreach is positive, but the author's lack of response isn't necessarily wrong. They need to heal. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). They have a valid reason for not engaging. The key is whether they're being cruel or selfish, but given the context, it's about personal healing and boundaries. The mother's actions in the past are the main issue here.\n"
