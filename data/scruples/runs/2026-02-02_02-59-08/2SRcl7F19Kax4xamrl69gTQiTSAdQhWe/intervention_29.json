It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has five kids by different fathers and is single. The friend has been making some comments that the author found insulting. The author finally responds by telling her that having five kids with different dads and no child support makes it hard to find someone. The friend gets angry and hangs up, and now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author mentions that the friend has been making these comments for two years, which are not just questions but are framed as insults. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses. Then, after repeated provocations, the author responds truthfully about the friend's situation. The key here is whether the author's response was a valid and constructive way to address the issue or if it crossed a line.\n\nThe friend's comments about the author's weight, dates, and job seem pretty harsh and judgmental. The author points out that the friend tried to do the same job, which might indicate some insecurity or jealousy. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her being single. But the question is whether that's a fair or appropriate thing to say in the context of their conversation.\n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're not privileged and have worked hard. But the friends' perspective is that the author's comment was cruel and not helpful. It's possible that even if the author's statement is factually true, the way it was delivered could have been hurtful. The friend was vulnerable, and the author's response might have been more about putting her in her place than offering support.\n\nAlso, the author's friend might have deeper issues related to her situation that aren't immediately obvious. The author's comment, while perhaps well-intentioned, could have come off as judgmental rather than empathetic. In friendships, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like relationships and family, it's important to balance honesty with kindness. The author might have thought they were being honest, but the friends and the friend herself reacted negatively, suggesting that the approach wasn't appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author was justified in finally speaking up. If the friend's comments were consistently hurtful, the author might have felt justified in responding. However, the response focused on the friend's personal circumstances in a way that could be seen as attacking her character rather than offering constructive advice. Maybe there was a better way to address the friend's issues without pointing out her flaws in such a direct and potentially humiliating manner.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author was dealing with repeated insults and might have felt the need to respond, the way they did might have been unkind and contributed to the breakdown of the friendship. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was problematic, even if the underlying issue was valid. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the approach was likely inappropriate, making them partially at fault.\n"
