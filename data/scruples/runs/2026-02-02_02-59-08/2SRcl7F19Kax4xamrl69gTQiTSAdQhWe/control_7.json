It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and has been divorced five times. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's appearance and dating life for two years. The author kept brushing off the insults, giving advice like suggesting the friend focus on herself. Then, after the friend repeatedly asks why the author can get dates while she can't, the author responds by pointing out that having five kids with different dads and no child support makes it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets upset, hangs up, and now mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior was ongoing and hurtful. The author was being insulted repeatedly. The friend is using the author as a benchmark for her own problems, making comparisons that aren't fair. The author tried to deflect and give advice but eventually snapped, giving a direct answer that was truthful but maybe harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to respond that way. On one hand, the author was defending themselves after being insulted for two years. On the other hand, the response about the friend's personal situation might have been a low blow, even if true. The friend's issues with child support and multiple partners are sensitive topics. The author's comment could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life and possibly invalidating her feelings.\n\nThe author's friends are now side-eyeing them, saying they have \"skinny privilege\" and are entitled. But the author argues they've worked hard and aren't entitled. However, the comment about the friend's situation might have crossed a line, regardless of the prior insults. Even if the friend was being difficult, the author's response could have been more empathetic or constructive. Instead, it was a direct accusation that might have made the friend feel attacked, leading to the fallout.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. While the friend was being toxic, the author's response was a direct hit on the friend's personal choices, which might not have been constructive. There might have been a better way to address the situation without being hurtful. The author could have acknowledged the friend's struggles while still asserting their own boundaries. But considering the long history of insults, maybe the author felt cornered. Still, the final response might have been too harsh. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong for the way they replied, even if the friend was being difficult.\n"
