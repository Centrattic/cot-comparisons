It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she's single. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life for two years. The author has been brushing off these insults. Then, when the friend asks again why she can't get dates, the author responds by pointing out her situation with five kids and no child support. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the insults and the author's response. The friend's comments were personal and possibly hurtful. The author's response, while blunt, is addressing a real factor that might affect her dating life. However, the problem is that the author's comment, while possibly true, could be seen as judgmental. \n\nThe question is whether the author was justified in making such a direct statement. Even if the insults were low quality, responding with a potentially hurtful truth might not be the best approach. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment crossed a line, even if the friend was being insulting. \n\nAlso, the author's own situation is different\u2014having kids with one dad and a stable arrangement. But the author's response might have come off as condescending, implying that the friend's choices are the reason for her situation. The friends' reactions about privilege might be valid because the author's response could be seen as not understanding the complexities of the friend's life, even if the friend made mistakes. \n\nSo, while the friend was being insulting, the author's response might not have been the right way to handle it. The author could have addressed the insults without making a judgmental comment. There might have been a better way to set boundaries without attacking the friend's situation. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
