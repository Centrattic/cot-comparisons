It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and has been divorced five times. The friend keeps making hurtful comments to the author about her dating life and work. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason she might be struggling to find someone. The friend is upset, and now their mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author mentions that she's been brushing off the insults for two years, which is a long time. The friend's comments are not just teasing but are actually personal attacks, implying that the author's looks or job are the reasons she's successful in relationships. The author's response is direct and points out the friend's situation as a barrier to finding a partner. \n\nNow, is the author justified in her response? The friend's behavior has been hurtful and repetitive. The author tried to be supportive with general advice like \"focus on yourself,\" but that didn't stop the friend from continuing the attacks. When the friend keeps pushing, the author finally tells the truth as she sees it. But the problem is that the author's statement about the friend's five kids and lack of child support might be a sensitive topic. Even if true, bringing up such personal issues could be seen as crossing a line, especially in a friendship where there's a history of mutual insults. \n\nThe mutual friends are now saying the author is privileged and in the wrong. The author feels that she's not entitled and has worked hard for her achievements. However, the key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's reply might have been too harsh or judgmental. The friend's situation is complicated, and pointing out the child support issue could be seen as adding insult to injury, especially if the friend is already struggling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending herself after being insulted repeatedly. The friend's comments were untrue and personal. The author's response was honest feedback, but maybe she could have phrased it more compassionately. However, considering the friend kept attacking, the author might have felt justified in her response. Still, friends often have boundaries about what's acceptable to discuss, and child support and having multiple children might be sensitive topics that the author shouldn't have brought up, even if they're true.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in how she delivered the truth rather than the truth itself. But given the context of ongoing insults, it's a tough call. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was perceived as harsh, which might mean she was in the wrong. Alternatively, standing up for oneself after prolonged abuse could be seen as justified. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend was being hurtful, the author was defensive, and the response was direct but possibly too personal. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because she was responding to years of insults, but there might be a more constructive way to handle it. However, since the question is a yes/no, the author could be considered in the wrong for how she delivered the message, even if the content had some truth.\n"
