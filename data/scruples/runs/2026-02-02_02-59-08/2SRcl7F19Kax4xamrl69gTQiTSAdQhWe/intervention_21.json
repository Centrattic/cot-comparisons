It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about a friend who has five kids by different fathers and is single, and the author told her that this is why it's hard to find a partner. The friend got really upset and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is in the wrong because of things like \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was getting insulted by their friend for two years with comments about her body, dating life, and work. The friend's remarks were personal and seemed to be a way to deflect from her own issues. The author finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation with the five kids and child support. \n\nThe key points here: Was the author justified in responding as they did? The friend's comments were rude and personal, so the author might have felt they were being attacked. However, when responding, the author brought up the friend's personal circumstances, which could be seen as attacking her for her choices. \n\nEven if the friend was being mean, the author's response could be seen as cutting and potentially shaming her. The mutual friends think the author is privileged and doesn't understand her struggles. The author works in the adult industry, which might be a sensitive topic, but they also have an MBA and a stable income. The friend tried to work in the same field, so maybe that's a point of contention. \n\nIs it fair to tell someone that their personal choices (having multiple children with different partners) are the reason they're struggling? It's possible the author was trying to be honest, but the way they delivered it might have been harsh. The friend could take it as a personal attack, even if it's true. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of their words. \n\nAlso, the author's own situation is different\u2014they have two kids with the same father, so maybe the friend felt they couldn't relate. The author's job in the adult industry might be a point of judgment, but the friend also tried that, so maybe that's why she comments on it. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was hurtful. Even if the author was tired of being insulted, responding with a direct critique of the friend's personal life might not have been the best approach. It's possible that the author could have addressed the insults without attacking the friend's situation, perhaps by setting boundaries or not engaging. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author was defending themselves against insults, but the method might have been inappropriate. The friend's behavior was unkind, but the author's response could have been seen as crossing a line. The friends might be right in saying that the author's response was harsh, even if the insults were unwarranted. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is at fault because even if the friend was being mean, the response was potentially hurtful and didn't address the insults in a constructive way. The author could have handled it better without making personal attacks.\n"
