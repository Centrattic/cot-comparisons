It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author finally responds with a comment pointing out the friend's situation. The friend then gets upset and ends the conversation. The mutual friends are now siding with the friend, saying the author was wrong to comment like that.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's response was justified. The author argues they were just telling the truth after enduring insults. The friend's behavior seems to be a pattern of putting down the author, maybe to deflect from her own issues. \n\nBut when someone responds with a direct criticism about a sensitive topic like having multiple children with different fathers, even if it's true, it can come off as judgmental and hurtful. Relationships require mutual respect, and while the friend's insults were unkind, the author's response might have crossed a line by being personal and potentially stigmatizing.\n\nThe author's comment about child support and needing someone to accept that could be seen as shaming the friend. Even if the author's intent was to be honest, the delivery and content might not be constructive. Mutual friends seeing it as an example of \"skinny privilege\" or entitlement suggests that they believe the author didn't understand the friend's struggles, possibly because the author used a personal attack instead of a supportive approach.\n\nThe author could have handled it differently, maybe by setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal life. It's possible that the author's frustration led them to respond in a way that was more hurtful than helpful, which is why friends are now taking the friend's side.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be yes, the author is in the wrong for making a personal and potentially stigmatizing comment, even in the context of a friendship where insults were ongoing. The key point is that responding with a direct attack on the friend's personal situation, especially one that's sensitive and could be seen as judgmental, isn't the right approach, regardless of the provocation.\n"
