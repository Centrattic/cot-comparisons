It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author for two years. The author has been brushing them off with polite responses. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds honestly about her friend's situation. This causes the friend to get angry and hang up. Now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was defending herself after years of insults, and she gave a honest but blunt answer. But the mutual friends are calling the author privileged and a bad friend.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was justified. Was she just protecting herself from ongoing insults? Or did she overstep by pointing out her friend's situation, even if it's true?\n\nThe friend's comments were personal and possibly untrue (like the comment about the author being skinny, when she's not). The author's response was factual, pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulty in dating. However, even if true, delivering it in a way that might be perceived as judgmental could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend tried to do the same job but maybe didn't succeed, which might add context. The friend's behavior seems toxic and insulting, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is wrong. In relationships and friendships, honesty is important, but the way it's delivered matters. The author might have been within her rights to set a boundary after being insulted repeatedly. However, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that they see the author's response as harsh or privileged, which complicates things.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to set a boundary. If the friend was being abusive, the author might not be in the wrong for defending herself. However, the content of the response could be seen as attacking the friend's character, which might not be the best approach even if the insults were ongoing.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she was responding to a history of insults and was honest about her perspective. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. The answer might be B (No), as she was protecting herself from ongoing negativity. But some might argue that even if the friend was wrong, the author's response was too direct and hurtful. It's a bit of a toss-up, but considering the context of the friend's behavior, the author's response might be justified.\n"
