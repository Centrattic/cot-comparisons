It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their friend she's single because she has five kids with different fathers. The friend was making hurtful comments, and the author finally responded with that statement, leading to the friend being upset. The author is now getting backlash from mutual friends who say the author is being unkind and has privilege.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was insulting the author for two years, which is a long time. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses like \"focus on yourself.\" But when the friend kept attacking, the author gave a direct answer about the five kids and child support. \n\nNow, the key points are whether the author's response was appropriate. The author's friend has a history of making untrue and cutting remarks. The author's response was factual but could be seen as pointing out a sensitive issue. The friend's five children with different fathers and lack of child support might make it hard for her to find a partner, but the author's way of phrasing it might have been harsh. \n\nThe mutual friends are reacting by saying the author has privilege, but the author feels they've worked hard. The author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, which might be a sensitive topic. The friend also tried that job but failed. \n\nI need to weigh the friendship and the context. The author was defending against ongoing insults but maybe crossed a line by directly linking their friend's personal situation to her relationship issues. It's possible that while the friend was wrong to insult, the author's response was also unkind and potentially hurtful, even if true. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone has been rude, responding with a personal truth that could be seen as blaming might not be the best approach. The question is whether the author's response was justified. Since the friend was asking for advice, the author could have suggested focusing on self-improvement without attacking her circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a line in their response, even if the friend was being difficult. The author could have handled it more compassionately. Therefore, answer A.\n"
