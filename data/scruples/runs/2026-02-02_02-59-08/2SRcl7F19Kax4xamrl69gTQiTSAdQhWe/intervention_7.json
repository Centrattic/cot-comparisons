It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's still single because she has five kids by different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author for two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the truth they thought was relevant. Now the mutual friends are on the friend's side, saying the author has privilege and is being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior was ongoing and hurtful, with comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses like \"focus on yourself\" but eventually felt the need to be honest. The key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable and respectful way to address the situation.\n\nThe author's reply was about the friend's own situation\u2014five children with different fathers and no child support. This is a sensitive topic because it's personal and could be seen as judgmental. Even if it's true, bringing it up as a reason for being single might come across as blaming the friend for her choices, which can be very hurtful. The friend's reaction was anger and hanging up, which suggests the message was poorly received.\n\nThe mutual friends are reacting to the author's comment by bringing up \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement, which the author denies. The friend's comments were untrue and derogatory, so the author's frustration is understandable. However, responding with a direct accusation about the friend's personal history might not have been the best approach, even if the author was trying to be honest.\n\nI should think about whether the author had the right to address the friend's behavior in that way. While it's important to stand up for oneself, the method of response matters. Instead of pointing out the friend's own faults, maybe a better approach would have been to set a boundary, such as saying that the comments are hurtful and they don't want to hear them anymore. \n\nThe author's intention was to be honest, but the delivery was harsh and likely made the friend feel attacked. The friend's own issues (like child support, multiple partners) are part of her life and the author might not have the full context. For example, maybe the friend is in a difficult situation where getting child support is challenging, or she's actively working on her dating life. The author's blunt statement could be seen as insensitivity or judgment, which is why mutual friends are upset.\n\nAlso, the author's own situation (working in the adult industry, having an MBA, etc.) might have led to comparisons, but the friend's insults were low-quality and untrue. The problem is that the author's response, while addressing the root of the friend's issues, might have crossed a line into personal criticism rather than confronting the friend's behavior.\n\nIn summary, even if the author's intention was to be truthful and stop the insults, the way they delivered it was likely unhelpful and hurtful. The better approach would be to address the behavior without attacking the friend's personal choices. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong), but with the nuance that the friend's behavior was bad too. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and from a social perspective, calling out a friend's personal failings in a direct and unkind manner can be seen as crossing a line, even if the friend was being toxic first.\n"
