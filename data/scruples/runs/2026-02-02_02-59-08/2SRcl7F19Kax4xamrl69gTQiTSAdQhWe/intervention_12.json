It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are making it hard to find a partner. The friend was being insulting for two years, and finally, the author gave a blunt response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and possibly untrue. The author tried to brush them off but eventually snapped. The main question is whether the author's honest reply was justified or if it crossed a line.\n\nThe friend has a history of making low blows about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author's response was pointing out the friend's own issues, which might be a valid observation. However, even if true, the way it's delivered can matter. Calling out someone's problems in the middle of an argument might not be the best approach, especially if the person is already sensitive.\n\nThe mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, accusing the author of privilege. This could indicate that the author's comment was perceived as judgmental or hurtful, regardless of the truth. People often react badly to truths that are delivered harshly or in the heat of the moment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions working hard and not being entitled, but the friend's response was emotional, suggesting that the truth was not what she wanted to hear. Even if the author's statement is factually accurate, it might have come off as attacking rather than supporting.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might have had the right intention but used the wrong method. There could have been a better way to address the friend's issues without being confrontational. So, while the author's comment might be true, it's possible they were in the wrong for how they delivered it.\n"
