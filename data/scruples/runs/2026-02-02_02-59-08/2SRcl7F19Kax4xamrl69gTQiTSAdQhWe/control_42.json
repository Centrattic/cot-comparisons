It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children by different fathers is why she's having trouble finding a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making passive-aggressive comments about the author's dating life and job. The author has been trying to brush them off with advice like focusing on themselves. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds directly about the kids and child support. The friend reacts angrily and hangs up.\n\nLooking at the dynamics, the friend's comments seem to be insults disguised as questions. The author felt targeted and decided to address the root cause they believed was affecting the friend's dating life. But the friend took it as a personal attack. \n\nThe key here is whether the author was within their right to make that comment. The author's intention was to give an honest answer, but the delivery might have been harsh. Relationships can be complex, and while the author thinks the friend's situation is a factor, it's a sensitive topic. Friends might see this as crossing a line, even if the statement is factually true.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're being unfairly judged. However, the friend's actions (making insults) and the author's response (calling out the friend's situation) are both part of a conflict. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's not appropriate to publicly shame someone about their personal life, especially regarding sensitive topics like having multiple children. Even if the author's statement is true, the way it's delivered can be seen as a personal attack rather than constructive advice. The author might have had the right intention but used the wrong approach. \n\nAdditionally, the friend's history of insults and the author's frustration is context. But the friend's reaction isn't the excuse for the author's response. Both parties have contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author is not in the wrong for stating the truth as they see it, but the manner might have been unkind. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the author's honest response, though perhaps tactless, is based on their truthful perspective. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
