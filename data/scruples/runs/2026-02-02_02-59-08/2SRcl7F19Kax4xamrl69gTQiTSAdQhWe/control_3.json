It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. The situation involves a lot of back and forth between the two friends, with the friend making repeated comments that the author finds insulting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend has been making comments that are not only personal but also insulting. The friend's remarks are about the author's appearance, dating life, and job, which the author has been brushing off for two years. The final straw is when the author responds honestly, pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her difficulty in finding a partner. The friend then gets angry and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful, but the author's response was direct and critical of her personal choices. Even if the author's statement is factually true, the manner in which it was delivered might be problematic. The friend's situation is complex, and while the author's intent might have been to be honest, it could come off as judgmental without empathy.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend tried to work in the same industry, but that's a separate point. The main issue is the direct criticism of the friend's life choices. Even if the friend's behavior was irritating, the author's response might not have been the best approach. Maybe there was a more constructive way to address the friend's insecurities without pointing out the negative aspects of her situation, which could be seen as attacking her rather than offering support.\n\nAdditionally, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that they perceive the author's comment as lacking understanding or privilege. The author might not have considered the sensitivity of the topic, as having multiple children with different partners can be a stigmatized situation. The author's response could be seen as adding to the friend's emotional burden rather than offering constructive feedback.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the author had been defending themselves against insults, their response might cross a line by being critical of the friend's personal life in a way that's hurtful. The friend's actions might be problematic, but the author's approach could be seen as unkind, even if their intention was to be truthful.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because the response was unkind and potentially harmful, even if the friend's behavior was annoying. The better approach would have been to address the insults without attacking the friend's personal choices directly.\n"
