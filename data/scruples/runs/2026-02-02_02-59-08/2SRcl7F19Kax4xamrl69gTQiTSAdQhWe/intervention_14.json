It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of making hurtful comments and insults towards the author. The author tried to brush them off, giving advice like focusing on oneself. But when the friend continued to pester with more insults and questions, the author finally responded honestly, pointing out her situation with the kids and child support. The friend was upset, hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being entitled or having privilege.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend was being rude and judgmental, so the author felt justified in calling out the friend's behavior. But friends are saying the author was wrong. The question is, was the author in the wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author was responding to years of insults and felt that their friend was projecting her own issues onto them. The author's comment was a factual observation that having multiple children with different fathers without child support could make it hard to find someone. But on the other hand, even if the statement is true, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, especially in the context of a friendship where the friend was already sensitive about her situation. The author's tone and the fact that they were being defensive could have made it come off as judgmental rather than supportive.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions might be pointing out that the author's response could be seen as privileged or not understanding the friend's struggles, even if the author is working hard themselves. The friend's history of making personal, insulting remarks might have contributed to a toxic dynamic where the author's defense was a reaction to being attacked.\n\nIn terms of whether it's right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author had a right to set boundaries after repeated insults, but the response might have been too direct in a way that didn't consider the friend's feelings. A better approach might have been to address the friend's behavior without directly accusing her of the root cause of her situation. Maybe focusing on how the friend's comments were hurtful rather than pointing out her flaws. So, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled it, even if the underlying truth is valid.\n"
