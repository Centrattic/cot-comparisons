It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the author was justified in telling their friend that her being single with five kids by different fathers is the reason she's struggling to find a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has a history of multiple divorces and children with different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The author has been enduring two years of insults from the friend, which are both personal and untrue. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her single status. The friend reacts angrily, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and not understanding the friend's situation.\n\nThe key points to consider here are about the nature of the author's response and the appropriateness of addressing the friend's issues directly. The author felt that the insults were low-quality and untrue, so they decided to give an honest but blunt answer. However, the friend's behavior includes personal attacks, which the author had previously dismissed with generic advice. The author's response was direct and pointed out a specific aspect of the friend's life that could be affecting her relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author might argue that they were being honest and addressing a real issue. On the other hand, the friend's behavior was already toxic, and the author's response, while true, was potentially hurtful and might have crossed a line. The mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting that the author's comment was unkind or privileged.\n\nBut the author also had their own challenges, including working in a controversial job and managing two children from a split custody situation. The author's response could be seen as a defense mechanism after enduring two years of insults. However, even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered can affect whether it's considered inconsiderate or not. The author might have been justified in feeling frustrated, but the directness of their response could be seen as harsh, especially in a friendship where the friend's actions were already problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author's comment might have been valid in that having multiple children with different fathers without child support could indeed make it difficult to find a partner. However, the delivery was perhaps not the most supportive. The friend's behavior included personal attacks, which the author had been tolerating. The author's response was a direct answer to a direct question, but it might have been better phrased in a more compassionate way.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's statement was technically true, but the way it was delivered and the context of the friendship might make the author at fault for not handling it more sensitively. However, the friend's ongoing insults and the author's repeated attempts to brush them off could also be a factor. The author might have been within their right to set a boundary, but the method could be questioned. The mutual friends' reactions might reflect social norms that prioritize sensitivity over blunt honesty, even if the honesty is true.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because the response was a direct and potentially hurtful comment in a situation where the friend was already being unkind. However, the author's intent was to address an underlying issue that the friend might not have been considering. This is a bit of a gray area, but the consensus might be that the author overstepped, hence answer A.\n"
