It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are making it hard to find a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making constant, insulting comments towards the author, which the author has been brushing off for two years. The friend's comments are personal and seem to imply that the author's success in relationships is due to being skinny or \"basic,\" which the author finds hurtful. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds by pointing out her situation with five kids and no child support.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to handle the ongoing insults. The author feels they were just being honest and finally stood up for themselves. However, mutual friends are reacting negatively, suggesting the author is privileged and didn't understand the friend's situation.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and repetitive, so the author felt they had to respond. But the response might be seen as attacking the friend's personal life, which could be a sensitive topic. Even if the friend had it coming, bringing up her children and child support might be crossing a line. The author might have thought they were being honest, but the way it's phrased could come off as judgmental or condescending, especially since the author's own situation is different (stable relationship, same father for kids). \n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions are important. They think the author is being entitled and not understanding the friend's struggles. That might indicate that the author's response was harsh or not empathetic enough. Even if the friend was rude, the author's reply might not have been constructive and could have been more supportive while still setting boundaries. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for how they delivered their response, not the content itself. It's possible that a better approach would have been to address the insults without attacking the friend's personal choices. They could have said that the comments are hurtful and set boundaries without being critical of her life choices. \n\nIn conclusion, while the friend was being cruel, the author's response might have been too confrontational and judgmental, making them partly responsible for the fallout. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the way they handled the situation, even if their intent was to be honest.\n"
