It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids by different fathers. The friend was making hurtful comments, and the author finally snapped with that response. The friend got upset, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying things like \"skinny privilege\" and that they're being unkind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was on the receiving end of two years of insults from their friend. The friend made comments about the author's weight, work, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off but eventually responded with a statement linking the friend's situation to her difficulties in finding a partner. \n\nThe key points here are the nature of the insults and the author's response. The friend's comments were not just about the author's dating life but also personal attacks on her body image and career. The author's response pointed out a factual aspect of the friend's life that could realistically impact her dating options\u2014multiple kids with different fathers without child support. That's a sensitive topic, but is it fair to bring it up in this context?\n\nNow, mutual friends are saying the author is wrong because they have \"skinny privilege\" and are entitled. The author argues they worked hard and aren't privileged. The friend's issues might be seen as different from the author's, but the author's comment could come off as judgmental. Even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered might not be constructive. The friend was already upset, and the author's response might have crossed a line from honest feedback to personal attack.\n\nAlso, the friend had a history of making the author feel bad, but the author's response might not have been the best approach. Maybe there was a more empathetic way to address the underlying issues without pointing out the friend's personal situation. The author might have been trying to help, but it came out as harsh and damaging.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, friends might side with the person who was more visibly attacked, especially if the response was seen as the final straw. The author might be right to feel frustrated, but their method of responding could have been more constructive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that comment despite the provocation.\n\nConsidering all factors, even if the comment was truthful, the way it was delivered in the context of a strained friendship might make the author at fault. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They could have handled it differently, and their response might be seen as hurtful and judgmental, especially given the mutual friends' reactions.\n"
