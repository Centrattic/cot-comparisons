It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their friend she's single because of having five kids by different fathers is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's appearance and dating life for two years. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the kids and child support. The friend got angry and hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe author feels they were just being honest and defending themselves after years of insults. Their friend's comments were personal and untrue, so the author's response was based on what they saw as the real issue. But the friends think the author overstepped.\n\nI need to consider if the author was justified. The friend was making personal attacks, so the author's response was in reaction to those. However, bringing up someone's personal issues, especially sensitive ones like having multiple children and child support problems, can be seen as crossing a line even if the friend was being mean first.\n\nIs it okay to call out someone's behavior when they are being insulting? Maybe, but the way it was done might have been harsh. The author's response was direct and pointed out a specific issue that the friend might have found offensive. Even if the friend was being mean, the author's comment could be seen as attacking their personal situation rather than addressing the insults.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author might have hurt the friend's feelings more than necessary. The author's friend has her own issues, and the author's comment might have been insensitive, even if it's a valid observation. People often don't respond well to criticism, especially when it's personal and comes after a long time of being insulted.\n\nThe author worked hard, but the situation involves complex personal issues. Maybe the author could have responded differently, focusing on their own experiences without pointing out the friend's flaws. The friend's behavior might be rooted in her own insecurities, and the author's response might not have addressed that constructively.\n\nIn the end, while the friend was being rude, the author's response might have been too direct and could have alienated their friend and mutual friends. It's possible that the author was trying to help but did it in a way that came off as judgmental rather than supportive.\n"
