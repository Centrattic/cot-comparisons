It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if it was wrong for the author to tell their friend that her status as having five kids with different fathers is why she's single and not getting dates. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author for two years, and the author finally snapped with a truthful response.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The friend had been making repeated, insulting remarks that were not only personal but also untrue. The author mentions that they tried to brush off the insults with polite responses, but the friend kept pushing. The final comment was about the author's job in the adult industry and their financial situation. So the author felt attacked and responded with a truth they believed to be the case.\n\nNow, the author's reply was that the friend's situation with five kids by different fathers made it hard for her to find someone. The friend then reacted angrily and hung up. The mutual friends are now saying the author is in the wrong, citing things like skinny privilege and entitlement. The author feels this is unfair because they work hard and aren't privileged.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's response was justified. On one hand, the friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and persistent, so the author had a reason to feel defensive. On the other hand, pointing out a personal truth about someone else's issues could be seen as cutting in a way that's unkind, even if it's true. The key question is whether the author crossed the line, despite the provocation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend had a history of making untrue and low-quality insults. The author's response was a direct counter to the friend's accusations, which might be seen as self-defense in a conversation. However, the nature of the response\u2014highlighting a personal flaw (multiple children by different fathers) could be sensitive and might have been a harsh way to respond, even if the friend was being insincere.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions suggest that they see the author's comment as harsh and judgmental. They argue that the author is being privileged and not understanding the friend's situation. The author disagrees, saying they've worked hard and aren't entitled. This part might relate to the perception of the author's response as coming from a place of judgment rather than empathy, even if the friend was being difficult.\n\nAnother angle: the author's job in the adult industry is a sensitive topic, and the friend had tried to do the same. The friend's insults about the author's job might have added to the tension. The author's response about the friend's family situation might have been a way to deflect or counter the friend's attacks, but it could also be seen as unkind.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's true that the friend was being rude, the appropriate response is debatable. Telling someone they're single because of their personal choices, especially when it's a sensitive topic like having multiple children by different fathers, could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the author believes it's the truth, delivering it in a way that's blunt without considering the friend's feelings might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that \"none of them pay child support\" might imply judgment about the friend's past relationships, which could be hurtful. The friend might feel that the author is blaming her for her situation, which could be a sensitive issue given her history.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be partly in the wrong because their response, while perhaps motivated by defensiveness, was a personal attack that could be seen as unkind and judgmental, even if it was a truthful observation. However, the friend's prior behavior was also clearly inappropriate, which complicates the situation. But in terms of the author's response, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they addressed a sensitive topic in a way that escalated the conflict rather than resolving it. The friends' reactions also suggest they see the author as the one who overstepped, which is a common social perspective in such cases.\n\nBut wait, the author did say it was the truth. The question is whether truth justifies the response. In some contexts, honesty is appreciated, but when it's delivered in a hurtful way without considering the other person's feelings, it can still be seen as wrong. The author had been trying to avoid engaging with the insults, which is a reasonable approach, but when they finally responded, they used a personal truth that could be hurtful. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
