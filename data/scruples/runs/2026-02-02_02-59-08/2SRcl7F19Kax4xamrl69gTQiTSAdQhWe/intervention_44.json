It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and no child support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making comments that the author feels are insulting. For example, the friend questions how the author got a man at 30 with kids, implying it's because of being skinny, and makes other remarks like needing to stop eating or that guys only want basic blondes. The author has been brushing these off, but after two years of similar comments, finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a reason she's still single. \n\nThe author's main point is that the friend was being disrespectful and making untrue, low-quality insults, so they replied with what they considered the truth. The friend then got angry and hung up. Now, mutual friends are telling the author they have \"skinny privilege\" and are being a bad friend.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and targeted the author's personal traits, like weight, job, and appearance. However, the author's reply was about the friend's own situation. \n\nIn terms of friend dynamics, even if the friend was being mean, is it right to call out their personal choices in a way that might be seen as judgmental? The author mentions that the friend has five kids with different dads and no support, but that's part of her life. The author's response, while honest, might have been harsh or not the right way to handle it. \n\nAlso, mutual friends are now criticizing the author, suggesting that they were entitled and didn't understand the friend's struggles. The author's defense is that they work hard and aren't privileged, but the question is whether their response was justified. \n\nEven if the friend was being unkind, the author could have chosen a different approach. Instead of directly pointing out the friend's issues, maybe setting boundaries without attacking. For example, saying they don't want to discuss that topic or that the comments hurt. \n\nThe friend's own situation might not be the author's fault. The author's reply was factual, but it's possible that it came off as blaming the victim, especially if the friend is facing stigma or other challenges. The mutual friends might see the author as contributing to the friend's feelings of being judged. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend was clearly being rude and making personal attacks. The author might have felt they had to defend themselves. But the way they did it could have been more compassionate or tactful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because even though the friend was being insulting, the author's response might have been too direct and could have been hurtful. Friends should support each other, and while the friend's comments were bad, the author could have handled the situation differently without attacking the friend's personal circumstances. The fact that the mutual friends are now siding with the friend also suggests that the author's approach was problematic.\n"
