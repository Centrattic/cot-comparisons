It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers and no child support. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has a history of making hurtful comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush off the insults for two years but finally snapped and called out the friend's situation. The friend reacted angrily, hung up, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they're privileged and in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was subjected to two years of insults, which were personal and maybe untrue. The friend's comments were not just idle chatter but targeted the author's appearance, work, and personal choices. The author finally stood up for themselves by pointing out the friend's history of multiple divorces and children with different fathers as a potential reason for her difficulties in dating. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. In terms of directness, the author's response was honest but might have been harsh. Friends often have boundaries, and after repeated insults, it's natural to set one. However, the author's comment could be seen as judgmental. The friend's situation is complex\u2014having multiple children with different fathers might be due to various factors beyond her control. The author's comment assumes that the friend's choices are the sole reason for her current state, which might not be entirely fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was clearly toxic, with repeated insults that were personal and possibly untrue. The author was defending themselves, pointing out a possible reason that the friend herself might not have considered. However, the way it was delivered might have been more about deflecting the insults than genuinely helping. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are taking the side of the insulted friend, suggesting that the author's response was harsh and that they have \"privilege.\" The author feels they're being unfairly labeled as privileged when they believe they've worked hard. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally not acceptable to openly insult someone, but when the insults continue, the line between defending oneself and retaliating can be blurry. The author's response was direct but might have been more effective with more empathy. Instead of pointing out the friend's history as a reason, maybe the author could have said something like, \"I think your situation is tough, and maybe people are hesitant because of the complexities with the children.\" \n\nBut the author did state the truth as they saw it. However, \"truth\" in social contexts isn't always the best approach if it's delivered without sensitivity. The friend's actions were wrong, but the author's response might have crossed a line by focusing on the friend's past choices in a way that could be seen as shaming.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were defending themselves from ongoing insults. However, the manner in which they responded could have been more compassionate. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The user's question is a yes/no based on the options. Since the author was responding to repeated insults and tried to call out the root cause, even if harshly, they might not be in the wrong. But depending on cultural or social norms, some might say it's too direct. However, given the context, B seems appropriate.\n"
