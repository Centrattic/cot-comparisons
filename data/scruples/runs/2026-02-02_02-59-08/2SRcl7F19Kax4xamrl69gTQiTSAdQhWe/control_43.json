It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend has five kids from different fathers, all divorced, and the author is tired of her constant insulting questions. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her difficulty in finding a partner. The friend reacts angrily, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intent was to tell the truth they observed, but the manner might have been harsh. The friend's behavior included insults towards the author's job and appearance, leading the author to snap. The mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, suggesting that the author was rude.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Even if the friend was being insulting, is pointing out a factual reason considered an insult? The author's response might be seen as judgmental, even if true. The friend's situation is complex, and the author's comment could be hurtful regardless of the truth. Also, the author's past responses (like \"focus on yourself\") suggest they tried to be supportive, so maybe they felt they had a right to be honest.\n\nBut the way it's delivered could be problematic. Instead of a constructive approach, the author directly attributed the friend's single status to her past choices, which might come off as dismissive. The friend's reaction indicates that the message was received as a personal attack. The mutual friends' reactions also suggest that the author's comment wasn't perceived as supportive, even if the intent was to help.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether honesty about a sensitive topic is justified, even if it's true. But in relationships, sometimes the truth isn't the best approach, especially if it's delivered in a way that's hurtful. The author might have been within their right to be honest, but the way it was said likely caused harm, making them at least partially at fault. Alternatively, if the friend was being consistently insulting, the author might have had a right to defend themselves. However, the mutual friends' perspective is that the author was harsh and entitled, which implies that the author overstepped.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer is likely A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong because the response was harsh and unconstructive, even if the underlying truth is valid. They might have handled it better with more empathy.\n"
