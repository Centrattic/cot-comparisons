It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has gone through five marriages and is still single, with kids from different fathers. The friend has been making comments that the author feels are insulting, like implying that the author's success in dating is due to being skinny or only being a \"basic blonde.\" The author has been brushing off these comments, giving polite responses, but finally snaps and tells the friend that her situation with five kids and no child support is making it hard for her to find someone. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now the author is getting backlash from mutual friends who say the author was wrong and that the friend isn't going through much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was defending themselves against repeated insults, which is understandable. The friend's comments seem to be both personal attacks and maybe some projection. The author's response was pointing out a fact about the friend's situation that could be a barrier to dating. But the question is whether that was the right approach.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to be honest and set boundaries after enduring insults. The friend's behavior was toxic, and the author wasn't the one being cruel first. However, the author's response was a direct accusation about the friend's choices and circumstances, which could come across as harsh, even if true. Friends might see it as attacking the friend's personal life instead of just dismissing the insults. The mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, suggesting that the author's comment was insensitive or crossed a line, even if the statement itself was factual.\n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, which might be a sensitive topic. The friend had tried that as well, so maybe there's some jealousy or competitiveness there. The author's truth was likely meant to be a constructive point, but the delivery might have been too direct and hurtful, especially given the history of the friend's insults. The author might have felt justified, but the context of the friendship and the way the truth was delivered could have been handled better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author was trying to assert themselves after being insulted, which is valid, but the method might have been inappropriate. The key is whether the response was a proportional reaction to the insults. The author's comment was factual but potentially hurtful, and even if true, it might not be the best way to respond. The friend was in a vulnerable situation, and pointing out the challenges she created for herself could be seen as adding insult to injury, even if the author's intention was to be honest.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because while the statement was true and a response to insults, it's possible that a better approach could have been taken. The author could have addressed the insults without being offensive themselves. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was not well-received and might have been unnecessarily harsh. So the answer is probably A.\n"
