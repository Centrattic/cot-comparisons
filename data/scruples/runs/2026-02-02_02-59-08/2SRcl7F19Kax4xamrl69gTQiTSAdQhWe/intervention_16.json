It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single with five kids by different fathers is why she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments, and the author finally snapped and gave a direct answer. Now the mutual friends are saying the author is being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had been making snide remarks about the author's weight, dating life, and job. The author tried to brush them off for two years but then finally responded with something that hit on the friend's personal situation. The author's intention was to be honest and point out a possible reason for the friend's difficulties, but it backfired.\n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. Even if the author felt insulted and was tired of the friend's comments, does that justify making a personal comment about the friend's life choices? The friend's situation is indeed complex, with multiple divorces and no child support. The author's comment about it being hard for someone to accept that when the friend is actively seeking a father figure might be a valid observation, but the way it's delivered could be seen as hurtful and judgmental.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are criticizing the author for using the friend's situation as a punchline, which might be true. The author's response, while honest, might have crossed a line into personal criticism rather than constructive advice. Even if the friend was being difficult, the author's reply could be seen as attacking her rather than supporting her through her struggles.\n\nAnother angle: the author has their own challenges, like working in the adult industry and managing two kids, which isn't easy. However, the focus here is on the friend's reaction and the author's response. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was hurtful and not supportive. Even if the author's intentions were to help, the method was harsh and not kind, which can damage a friendship.\n\nIn terms of privilege, the author might not see their own situation as privileged, but others might. The friend's comments about the author's work and the author's industry could have been another point of tension. But the author's response might have come across as dismissive of the friend's real issues, even if the author had their own struggles.\n\nSo, even though the author had been put down, responding in a way that judges the friend's life choices might not be the right approach. The better approach might have been to set a boundary without attacking the friend's personal life. The author could have said something like, \"I don't feel comfortable discussing this,\" or addressed the friend's comments without making them personal. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they responded with a hurtful truth that was personal and judgmental, even if their intention was to be honest. The key is that the method of response was inappropriate, regardless of the intention. So the answer should be A.\n"
