It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and is single, divorced, and keeps asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author finally responds by pointing out that having five kids with different dads without child support might make it hard for someone to commit. The friend gets angry, and now mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they've been brushing off insults for two years. The friend's comments are about the author's weight, job, and dating life, which the author finds low quality and untrue. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as a reason for her difficulty in dating. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior (insulting), the author's response (truthful but maybe harsh), and the aftermath (mutual friends' reactions). \n\nThe author might feel justified because they were defending themselves from insults, especially since the friend was in the same industry. The author's statement about the child support could be a true factor affecting the friend's dating life. However, pointing that out in a conversation might be seen as attacking the friend's personal life, which could be hurtful even if accurate.\n\nOn the other hand, mutual friends are saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is being entitled. The author feels they are not privileged and have worked hard. But maybe the friends think the author's comment was out of line because it's a sensitive topic, and the friend's situation is complex. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of bringing up the child support issue, even if it's true. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong for making that comment. If the author was responding to years of insults, maybe they felt it was a valid point. However, confronting someone in anger or frustration, even if the statement is true, might come off as attacking rather than helpful. The author could have chosen a different approach, but does that make them wrong? \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction (insult fury and hanging up) suggests that the comment hit a nerve. The author might not be in the wrong for speaking the truth, especially if they were tired of the insults. But in terms of friendship dynamics, maybe the way it was delivered was harsh, making them at least partially at fault. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's comment was a truthful response to their friend's situation, possibly as a defense against ongoing insults. However, the method of delivery and the context of their friendship might have made it inappropriate. So, it's a bit of a grey area. But since the mutual friends are criticizing the author and the situation involved a sensitive personal issue, the answer leaning towards A (author is wrong) might be more likely. Alternatively, if the author was just standing up for themselves after being insulted, B (not wrong) could be valid. Hmm.\n"
