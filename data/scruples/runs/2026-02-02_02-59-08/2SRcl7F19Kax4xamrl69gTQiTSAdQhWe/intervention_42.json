It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend with five kids by different fathers and multiple divorces. The friend has been making hurtful comments to the author for two years. The author finally replied that the friend's situation is making it hard to find someone. Now, the mutual friends are saying the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend was making persistent, insulting remarks. The author tried to brush them off but eventually responded with a truth they felt was relevant. However, pointing out someone's personal issues, even if true, can come off as harsh, especially in the heat of the moment. The friend might have felt attacked, leading to the fallout.\n\nThe author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, and mutual friends are accusing them of privilege. Maybe the friends feel the author is minimizing the friend's struggles. Even if the author's statement was factually true, delivering it in a direct, unfiltered way without considering the emotional impact could be problematic. Friends might see it as an invasion of privacy or blaming the victim.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was also pretty toxic with constant insults. The author had a right to feel defensive. But responding by highlighting the friend's personal issues might not have been the best approach. There might have been a more constructive way to address the friend's insecurities without making a judgmental comment about her life choices.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's response, while perhaps a truthful observation, could be seen as crossing a line in the way it was delivered. The friends' reactions suggest that the comment was hurtful and not the right way to handle the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they responded, even if their intention was to set boundaries.\n"
