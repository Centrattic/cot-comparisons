It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers and has been divorced five times. The friend has been making insults towards the author for two years, asking why she's able to have a partner and kids while the friend is single. The author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with the five kids and no child support, which made the friend angry and hang up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author works in the adult industry and has an MBA, and the friend is also dating and being a mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of multiple divorces and children with different fathers. The author has been defending against these insults for two years, which is a long time. The friend's comments seem to be passive-aggressive and possibly hurtful, pointing out the author's appearance and job. The author's response was to call out the friend's situation, which might be the root of the problem. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that statement. The key point here is the content of the response. The author says, \"You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\" This is a direct critique of the friend's personal choices and circumstances. \n\nNow, the friend reacted strongly, leading to a fallout. The mutual friends are taking the friend's side, accusing the author of being privileged and not understanding the friend's struggles. The author feels that the friends are misjudging her and that she's not actually entitled, as she's worked hard and even has a non-traditional job. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was justified. The friend had been making hurtful comments for a long time, but when the author countered with what she believed was the truth, it escalated the conflict. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was perceived as harsh or judgmental, even if it's true. \n\nIn arguments like this, truth doesn't always make the comment okay. If the author's intention was to help by pointing out that the friend's situation might be affecting her dating life, maybe it's valid, but the way it was delivered could be seen as attacking the friend's character. The friend might feel judged instead of supported. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are emphasizing that the author should have handled it differently, perhaps not brought up the friend's personal life in such a direct and potentially shaming way. Even if the insults were untrue, the author's response might have crossed a line by focusing on the friend's past and implying it's the reason for her current situation. \n\nThe author might have thought she was being honest, but in the context of a friendship, honesty needs to be balanced with consideration and empathy. The statement could be seen as blaming the friend for her own circumstances, even if there's an element of truth. Friends are supposed to support each other, not criticize in a way that causes hurt. \n\nAdditionally, the friend's history of multiple divorces and children might make her more sensitive about her reputation and personal life. The author's comment about child support and looking for a father figure could be interpreted as attacking her, especially if the friend feels that her choices aren't the problem or if she's facing other challenges. \n\nThe friends' reactions about \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement might be part of the friend's narrative that the author is being judgmental. Even if the author isn't actually privileged, the way she responded might come off as dismissive of the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, while the friend's behavior was clearly insulting, the author's response, even if truthful, might have been delivered in a way that was hurtful and judgmental. The friends are likely pointing out that the author didn't have the right to make such a personal and potentially stigmatizing comment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here because the response, though honest, wasn't delivered with the necessary care to maintain the friendship and avoid further conflict.\n"
