It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making hurtful comments for two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out what they saw as the root of the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was clearly being rude and judgmental, making personal attacks about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush it off but was clearly frustrated. When the friend kept pushing, the author responded with the truth about the friend's situation. However, this response led to the friend getting angry and cutting off the relationship.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are siding with the friend, accusing the author of having privilege and being entitled. The author feels wronged because they believe they've worked hard and aren't privileged. The key issue here is whether the author's response was justified, even if the friend was being rude.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends are supposed to support each other even during conflicts. While the friend's insults were unkind, responding with a blunt truth about the friend's life might have crossed a line. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, the way it was delivered in the heat of the moment could be seen as attacking the friend's character. The author might have felt justified, but in social contexts, honesty is often tempered with empathy and tact. The fact that the mutual friends are criticizing the author's response suggests that others perceive the response as harsh or insensitive.\n\nAdditionally, the author's job in the adult industry and the friend's similar attempts might add another layer of complexity. However, the main conflict is the author's response to the friend's insults. Even if the friend was at fault, the author's reply could be seen as holding the friend's past actions against her, which might not be the best way to handle the situation. There might have been more constructive ways to address the friend's behavior without attacking her directly.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong, not because they didn't have a reason to be frustrated, but because their response escalated the conflict in a way that damaged the friendship. It's possible to stand up for oneself without being unkind, and the author's choice of words might have been too harsh, even if the underlying sentiment was a valid observation.\n"
