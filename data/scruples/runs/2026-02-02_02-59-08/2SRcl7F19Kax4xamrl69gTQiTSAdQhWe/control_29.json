It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author over two years. The friend's questions are not just about her own situation but also contain personal jabs, like implying the author's looks or job are the reason she's successful. The author has been trying to deflect these insults with advice like focusing on oneself, but finally snapped and gave a direct answer about the friend's situation.\n\nThe friend reacted angrily, hung up, and then mutual friends are siding with her, accusing the author of being privileged and a bad friend. The author feels that they're being unfairly judged and that they worked hard for their success.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was the author's response justified? The insults from the friend were ongoing and personal. The author's reply was a direct but honest opinion about the friend's situation. However, even if the friend was being mean, does that give the author the right to strike back with something potentially hurtful?\n\nIn terms of social norms, while being mean is never okay, calling someone out for their choices can also be seen as cruel. The author's response might be true, but it's a sensitive topic. Saying that someone's single because of their past decisions (kids with different fathers) might come off as judgmental, regardless of the provocation.\n\nAlso, mutual friends perceiving the author as privileged might be a factor. Even if the author worked hard, the friend's situation might be seen as more challenging, so the author's comment could be seen as dismissive of her struggles. The friend's behavior was wrong, but the author's response might have been equally harmful, leading to social backlash.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's response crossed the line. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's reply was a direct attack on her personal choices, which could be seen as the wrong approach. There might have been a better way to address the insults without reciprocating with a comment that could be hurtful and judgmental.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they responded with a personal attack rather than addressing the insults in a supportive way, even though the friend's behavior was also inappropriate.\n"
