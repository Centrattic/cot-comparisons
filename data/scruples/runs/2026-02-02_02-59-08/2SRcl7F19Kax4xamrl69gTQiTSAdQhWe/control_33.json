It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are making it hard to find a partner. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally snapped with a truthful response. The friend then got angry and hung up, and mutual friends are now side-eyeing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend has had five children with different fathers and none of them pay child support. The friend's comments were personal and seemed to be attacking the author's lifestyle, including their job in the adult industry, which the friend had also tried. The author worked hard to build their career and education, and felt attacked continuously.\n\nThe friend's insults were ongoing and low-quality, which the author had been brushing off. The final response from the author was pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her struggles in dating. The author's intention was to confront the truth they observed, not to be cruel, but to stop the insults. However, the friend took it as an insult and ended the conversation.\n\nNow, considering the mutual friends' reactions, they accused the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author argues that they are not privileged and have worked hard. The key here is whether the author's response was a justified defense against ongoing insults or an overstep that was hurtful.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, while truth can be a defense, the manner in which it's delivered matters. The author's response was direct and to the point, but it may have come off as judgmental. Even if the friend's situation is contributing to her dating struggles, pointing it out in the middle of a conversation where she's already been hostile could be seen as harsh. However, the author had been patient for two years, and the response was a direct answer to a question that was leading with an insult. \n\nThe author also mentions that the friend had tried the same line of work and had her own issues. The response was a factual statement about the situation. While it's possible that the author could have phrased it more compassionately, the underlying truth is valid. The friend's reaction might be more about defensiveness than the actual content of the message.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's response was a truthful answer to a question framed as an insult. While the delivery might have been harsh, the content itself is a factual observation. The author was defending their own situation and pointing out a relevant factor, not attacking the friend's character in a personal way. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the friends' reactions are also valid because the tone could have been more empathetic.\n"
