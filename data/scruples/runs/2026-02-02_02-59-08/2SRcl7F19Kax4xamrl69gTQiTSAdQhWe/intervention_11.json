It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because of having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally responded with the truth they felt was the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and seemed to mock the author's appearance and lifestyle, including their job in the adult industry. The author tried to brush off the insults, giving generic advice like \"focus on yourself.\" When the friend continued to question and insult, the author called out her behavior, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and inappropriate. However, the author's response points out the friend's life choices. The problem is that even if the statement is true, it might come off as judgmental or dismissive, especially if it's said in a confrontational way. Friends should support each other, but when there's a pattern of insults, the line between defense and being hurtful can blur.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are now blaming the author for having privilege and being entitled. The author feels this is unfair because they worked hard. However, the friend's situation might be more complex. Maybe she's facing stigma or other challenges that the author didn't consider. The author's response could have been perceived as invalidating her struggles, even if the friend's comments were wrong.\n\nIs there a better way to respond? Instead of directly attacking the friend's choices, perhaps the author could have said something like, \"I don't want to discuss this if you're going to make fun of me.\" But the author chose to address the root cause they believed was the problem. However, in doing so, they might have escalated the situation, leading to the friend's anger and the mutual friends' backlash.\n\nThe main issue is the toxicity of the friend's behavior. The author had the right to set boundaries. But the way they did it might have been harsh, especially if it was the first time confronting the issue. Friends might expect a more supportive approach rather than a direct accusation. The author's truth might be valid, but the method of delivery could have been unkind, making it seem like an attack instead of a constructive response.\n\nSo, while the friend was definitely in the wrong for the insults, the author's response, though truthful, might not have been the right approach. They could have handled it more compassionately. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they responded, even if their intent was to help.\n"
