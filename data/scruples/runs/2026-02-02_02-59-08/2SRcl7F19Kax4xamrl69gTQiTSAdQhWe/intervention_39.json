It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a friend to someone who has had five kids with different fathers and is currently single. This friend has been making a lot of comments over two years that the author feels are insulting. The friend's comments are things like questioning how the author managed to have a man at 30 with kids, implying it's because she's skinny, suggesting she should eat like that, and making remarks about her job and dating life. The author has been brushing these off with advice like \"focus on yourself.\" Finally, when the friend asks again why the author has dates while she doesn't, the author responds by saying the friend has five kids with different dads and no child support, making it hard for someone to take her seriously when looking for a partner. This leads to the friend being upset and others saying the author was in the wrong, accusing her of being privileged and a bad friend. The author feels this is unfair and is now upset.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was appropriate. The key here is whether the author's comment was a fair and constructive response to the friend's behavior or if it crossed a line. The author was defending herself against what she perceived as insults, but the way she responded might have been hurtful or judgmental.\n\nThe author's friend has a history of making personal and potentially hurtful comments, but the author's rebuttal focused on the friend's family situation. The friend's actions (multiple children with different fathers, lack of child support) are indeed personal and sensitive topics. By pointing out those specific issues, the author may have been addressing the root cause of the friend's dating struggles, but in a way that could be seen as shaming or blaming the friend. Even if the statement is true, the delivery and context matter. The friend was already upset and making negative comments, and the author's response might have been a direct jab rather than a supportive conversation.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions indicate that the author's comment was hurtful. They mentioned \"skinny privilege\" and that the author is entitled, which suggests that the author's approach might have been perceived as judgmental and invalidating. The author could have chosen a different way to address the situation without attacking the friend's personal life. For example, instead of pointing out the number of children and fathers, the author could have explained that everyone's circumstances are different and offered support without making a judgment.\n\nMoreover, the author's job in the adult industry is mentioned, which is a sensitive topic. The friend has also made comments about the author's job, and the author might have felt the need to counter that by bringing up the friend's own issues. However, this could come off as a tit-for-tat response, which isn't constructive. The author might have been trying to assert their own worth but ended up causing more harm.\n\nIn terms of the friend's behavior, while she has made some personal insults, it's possible that she's dealing with her own insecurities and frustrations, which led her to lash out. The author's response, while perhaps honest, might have been the breaking point that made the friend feel attacked, leading to the fallout.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their response was a direct attack on the friend's personal life, even if it was in response to insults. The better approach would have been to address the friend's behavior without making personal criticisms. The author's comment, while possibly true, was likely hurtful and contributed to the breakdown in their friendship. So, the answer is A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
