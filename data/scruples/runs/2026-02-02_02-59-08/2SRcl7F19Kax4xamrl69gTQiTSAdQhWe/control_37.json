It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their friend that her status as a single mother with five kids from different fathers is affecting her ability to find a partner.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments for two years. The author tried to brush them off, giving polite replies like \"focus on yourself.\" But when the friend keeps pushing, the author finally responds with the truth about her situation. The friend becomes upset and ends the conversation. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is wrong, accusing them of being privileged and not understanding the friend's struggles.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's persistent insults and the author's response. The author felt attacked for a long time and decided to be honest about the friend's situation. The question is whether that response was appropriate. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to defend themselves and address the root cause of the friend's issues. The friend's comments were personal and cutting, so the author's reply was a direct response to the underlying problem they observed. However, the way it was delivered (calling out the friend's situation directly) might have been harsh, even if the content was true. The friend's reaction was intense, leading to a breakdown in communication and the mutual friends' criticism of the author.\n\nBut considering the context, the author had a history of being insulted and giving constructive advice without success. The final response was a factual statement about the friend's situation, which might not be the author's place to point out, even if it's true. However, the friend's behavior was clearly disrespectful, so the author might feel justified in setting a boundary. \n\nThe author's job in the adult industry is a sensitive topic, and the friend's insults about that might have added to the tension. The mutual friends' reactions suggest they believe the author overstepped, but the author's intention was to address the root issue rather than just tolerate the insults. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while honesty is good, the method of delivery and the content can affect how it's received. The author might have been better off addressing the friend's behavior without directly calling out her personal situation. However, given the friend's continuous negativity and the author's efforts to stay patient, the author's response could be seen as a legitimate defense of their own boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author should have handled it differently. If the response was truthful but harsh, they might still be in the right for standing up for themselves after prolonged insults. However, if the method was too direct or judgmental, they could be seen as in the wrong. The mutual friends think the author is privileged, but the author argues they've worked hard. It's a tough call, but considering the friend's ongoing behavior, the author's response might be justified as a necessary boundary.\n"
