It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's having trouble finding a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making repeated, insulting comments about the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush off the insults for two years but finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her lack of success in dating.\n\nThe friend became angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled, even though the author mentions they work hard and have an MBA. The author feels wronged because they believe they're not privileged and were just defending themselves.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and insulting, but the author's response was direct and potentially sensitive. Even if the statement is true, bringing up someone's personal situation (like having multiple kids with different fathers) can be very hurtful and may not be the right approach, even if the friend was being mean.\n\nThe key here is whether the author crossed a line by addressing the root cause of the friend's situation. While the friend's comments were inappropriate, the author's response might have been seen as attacking the friend's personal life, which could be considered a low blow. Friends might feel that the author was being judgmental, especially if it's a sensitive topic. Even if the friend was in the wrong for the insults, the author's response could have been hurtful in return, escalating the conflict.\n\nAlso, considering the mutual friends' reactions, they might feel the author was being unkind despite the provocation. There might be a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries without attacking the friend's personal choices. So, even if the author had a reason to be upset, the way they responded could be seen as wrong because it targeted the friend's personal issues rather than just standing up for themselves without reciprocating the negativity.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they responded with a potentially hurtful statement about the friend's personal life, even if the friend had been insulting them. However, there's nuance because the friend was being a jerk first. But in terms of the situation as presented, the author's response is likely seen as crossing a line.\n"
