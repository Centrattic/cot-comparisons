It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author was in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids with different fathers. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author's weight, dating life, and job. The author finally snapped, pointing out the friend's situation as the reason for her difficulties. Now, mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned that the friend had been persistently making hurtful and inaccurate remarks over two years. They had brushed off the insults with polite responses, but eventually, the friend's comments became too much. The author's response was direct and pointed out the friend's situation as a barrier to finding a partner. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author's response was justified given the prior context. The friend's behavior included repeated insults, and the author's reply was a factual statement about the challenge of having five children with different fathers. The author also explained that the friend's approach might deter potential partners, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the response could be seen as harsh or insensitive, depending on how it was delivered. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that they felt the author was being judgmental. The phrase \"you have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support\" is a factual statement but could come off as blaming or condescending. The author might have used a more empathetic approach, perhaps offering support or understanding while still pointing out the challenge.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had been enduring a long line of insults and may have felt justified in pushing back. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful, and the author's response was a direct address of the underlying issue. The question is whether pointing out the truth in such a situation, while the other person is being antagonistic, makes the author wrong. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, calling out a friend's problematic behavior can be tricky. If the author's intention was to help the friend by pointing out a realistic obstacle, it's a valid approach. However, the delivery and timing might have been the issue. The friend might have felt attacked, especially after the author's previous attempts to offer advice. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's response was a factual statement that might have been necessary given the friend's persistent behavior. However, the author could have approached it with more compassion. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the tone was off-putting. But in terms of right or wrong, the author was responding to years of insults with a truthful statement. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong.\n"
