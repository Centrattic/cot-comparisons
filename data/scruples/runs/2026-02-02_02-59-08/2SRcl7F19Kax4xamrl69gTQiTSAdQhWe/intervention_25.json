It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has five kids with different fathers, all divorced, and the friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author. The friend's comments are things like implying the author is skinny, a blonde, and that guys only want basic girls. The author has been brushing these off with some generic advice. Finally, when the friend keeps pushing, the author responds by pointing out that the friend's situation with five kids and no child support is making it hard to find someone. This causes the friend to get angry and hang up. Then, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making personal and insulting remarks towards the author. The author tried to handle it by deflecting and giving advice, but after two years of this, they finally snapped. The key here is whether the author's response was justified.\n\nThe author's response was honest but directly called out the friend's situation. However, even if the friend's situation is a contributing factor to her dating issues, the author might not have been the best person to point that out. The author's friend was already being judgmental and offensive, so responding with a similar level of criticism could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered might be harsh, especially given the friend's history of making personal attacks.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends are saying the author is being entitled and not understanding the friend's struggles. While the author might not have intended to be hurtful, bringing up the friend's personal life in a confrontational way could be seen as attacking her character instead of just addressing her behavior. The author could have chosen a different approach, like setting boundaries or not engaging in the conversation, rather than retaliating with a comment that might make the friend feel judged.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own situation. They mention working in the adult industry and having an MBA, which might contribute to some of the friend's jealousy or insecurity. The friend's insults might be stemming from her own issues, and the author's response might have been a way to deflect the insults by turning the tables. However, that doesn't necessarily make it right. The author might have a right to be defensive, but the method they used could have been more constructive.\n\nIn terms of friendship dynamics, when someone is consistently making hurtful comments, the appropriate response might be to communicate boundaries or walk away from the friendship rather than engaging in a tit-for-tat exchange. The author's response, while a reaction to two years of insults, might not be the healthiest way to handle it. It's possible the author is also feeling hurt and defensive, but responding with a direct critique about the friend's personal life could be seen as escalating the conflict.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because even if the friend was being insulting, responding with a similar attack could have been unnecessary and hurtful. There might have been a better way to handle it without damaging the friendship. The mutual friends' reactions also suggest that the author's approach was not well-received and might have been insensitive in the way it was delivered.\n"
