It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend who has been making a lot of hurtful comments for two years. The author finally responds by pointing out that the friend's multiple children with different fathers might be affecting her dating life. The friend got angry and hung up, and now mutual friends are accusing the author of being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was justified. The friend had been making repeated, personal insults over two years. The author tried to brush them off and even gave supportive answers, but the insults kept coming. When the friend finally asks about the author's dating life and the author responds with the truth, maybe the friend felt attacked. But is it fair for the author to bring up the five kids with different fathers?\n\nOn one hand, the author's comment was a factual observation. The friend's situation could be a barrier in finding a partner, so the author might have been trying to be honest. However, even if true, bringing it up in the middle of a conversation where the friend is asking for advice might come off as harsh. The author might have been defensive because they were tired of the insults, but the response might not have been the best approach.\n\nThen there's the part about mutual friends saying the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The author is in the adult industry, which might be seen as controversial, and they mention working hard for their success. The friends' reactions could be influenced by their own biases or not seeing the full context. But maybe the way the author framed their response was too direct and didn't consider the friend's feelings, even if the friend had been rude.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author had the right to respond with that specific comment and if there's a better way to handle it. The author was defending themselves after two years of insults, but instead of offering support, they pointed out what they saw as the friend's issue. The friend might have interpreted it as blame, especially since the author's own situation is different (two kids with one dad, good custody). \n\nAlso, the author's comment could be seen as judgmental, even if based on truth. Friends might feel that the author is not a good listener and instead of providing support, they turned the conversation back on the friend's choices. So even if the author was tired of the insults, the response might not have been the right approach, leading to conflict with both the friend and mutual friends.\n\nIn summary, the author's intention was to be honest, but the method might have been hurtful. The friend had been making insults, but the author's response could be seen as crossing a line by pointing out the friend's personal issues, especially when they were seeking advice. So the author might be in the wrong for how they delivered the truth, even if the content was based on a real issue.\n"
