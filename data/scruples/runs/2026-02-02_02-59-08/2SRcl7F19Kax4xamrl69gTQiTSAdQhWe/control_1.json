It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers. The friend was making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend kept making personal and insulting remarks about the author's weight, job, dating life, etc. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses but eventually responded with the truth about the friend's situation. Now the mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's friend was being rude and making low-quality insults for two years. The author felt cornered and finally spoke their truth. It's possible the author was trying to defend themselves after years of being attacked. However, the response might have been harsh and could have been said in a more empathetic way.\n\nBut the friend's actions were continuous and hurtful. The author's response was a direct cause of the friend's behavior. The problem is that even if the friend was being mean, the author's response might have been the last straw. However, the author's comment, while honest, could be seen as pointing out a valid issue that affects the friend's dating life. \n\nThe mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, accusing the author of being privileged. The author feels they're being misjudged. The question is whether the author overstepped by pointing out the friend's situation, even if it's true. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The friend's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's response might have been confrontational. However, the author was defending themselves after enduring two years of insults. The answer might depend on cultural norms and social expectations. In some cases, being honest about a friend's problematic behavior is acceptable, but the manner and timing matter. The author might have handled it better by addressing the friend's behavior first, but given the context, it's possible they were within their rights to respond.\n"
