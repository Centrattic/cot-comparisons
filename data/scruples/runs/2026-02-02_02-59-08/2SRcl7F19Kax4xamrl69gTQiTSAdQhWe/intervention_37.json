It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single with five kids by different fathers is the issue. The friend had been making a lot of hurtful comments towards the author about their weight, dating life, and job. The author finally snapped and called out the friend's situation. Now, mutual friends are saying the author was wrong and has \"skinny privilege\" or is entitled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they've been brushing off insults for two years. The friend's comments were not just about her own life but directly attacking the author's appearance, dating success, and job. The author's response was pointing out the friend's situation as a reason for her being single. \n\nI think the key here is the nature of the insults and the response. The friend's comments were personal attacks, possibly stemming from her own insecurities. The author, after enduring this for a long time, responds with honesty about the friend's situation. But the author's job is also sensitive\u2014working in the adult industry, which might be a point of judgment from others. The mutual friends are siding against the author, suggesting they had it easier. \n\nHowever, the author's response might have been the trigger that caused the friend to lash out. Even if the statement is true, delivering it in that context could be seen as crossing a line. Friends are supposed to support each other, not use each other's problems as weapons. The author might have been justified in feeling upset by the constant insults, but the way they responded could have been hurtful and potentially invalidating. \n\nThe friend's issues with her dating life and child support are her own struggles, and pointing that out in a direct, unfiltered way during a conversation where the author was being attacked might not be the best approach. It's possible the author was trying to be honest but didn't consider the impact of their words, especially in the heat of the moment. \n\nAlso, the author's job in the adult industry might contribute to others' perceptions, and mutual friends might be biased. The author's response might have been a reaction to being attacked, but even so, it's possible they could have handled it differently. Maybe acknowledging the friend's struggles while also setting boundaries about the insults could have been a better approach. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a direct accusation that could be seen as shaming, even if it was in response to insults. The way they delivered the truth might have been unhelpful and contributed to the conflict. Alternatively, some might argue they had the right to defend themselves after being attacked. But in friendship dynamics, maintaining respect is crucial, and the author's response might have been too harsh given the circumstances.\n"
