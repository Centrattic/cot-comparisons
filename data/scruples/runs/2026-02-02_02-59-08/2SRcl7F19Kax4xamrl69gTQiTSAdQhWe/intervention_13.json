It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who has five kids with different fathers and is single, and the author told her that this is why she can't get a partner. The friend then got angry and hung up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been making comments that the author feels are insulting, like implying the author's looks or job status are the reason for her success. The author has been trying to brush these off but finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as the possible reason for her difficulty in finding a partner.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong to say that. Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, the author was defending themselves after enduring two years of what they perceive as insults. They might feel justified in pointing out the friend's situation as a possible barrier. However, bringing up someone's personal life, especially regarding multiple children with different fathers, could be seen as crossing a boundary. It's a sensitive topic and might come off as judgmental, regardless of the truth.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was anger and hanging up, which suggests the comment was hurtful. Friends often have disagreements, but the line between constructive feedback and personal attacks can be thin. Even if the author believes their statement is factual, delivering it in a way that's direct and critical without considering how it might be received could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the mutual friends' reactions. They mentioned skinny privilege and entitlement, implying the author's comment was dismissive of the friend's struggles. The author argues they've worked hard and aren't privileged, but the friends still feel the comment was unkind. This indicates a breakdown in communication and empathy.\n\nThe author's job in the adult industry and having an MBA might make them feel misunderstood, but the friend's comments were about the author's perceived advantages. The author might have felt the need to assert their own challenges, but the way they did it might have been harsh.\n\nIn terms of better ways to respond, maybe the author could have addressed the friend's issues without bringing up her personal situation. Offering support or suggesting professional help might have been a more constructive approach. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can lead people to say things they don't intend.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's statement was likely meant to be truthful and helpful but came across as hurtful and judgmental. Even if the underlying reason might be accurate, the delivery and the context of the ongoing insults make it a sensitive situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care and empathy.\n"
