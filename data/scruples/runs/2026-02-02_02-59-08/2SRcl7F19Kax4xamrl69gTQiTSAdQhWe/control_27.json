It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple kids with different fathers are making it hard for her to find a partner. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been making hurtful comments towards the author, like questioning how she got dates at 30 with kids, implying it's because she's skinny or only talks about sex. The author tried to brush these off and gave generic advice. Then, when the friend asked again, the author responded by pointing out the friend's situation with five kids by different fathers and no child support. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying she has \"skinny privilege\" and is being a bad friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was responding to a friend who was making personal and insulting comments. The author felt attacked and finally responded with her honest opinion about the friend's situation. The question is whether that response was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the friend was being rude and making assumptions, which might make the author's response seem justified. The author was defending herself after being insulted. On the other hand, bringing up the friend's personal situation in such a direct way might have crossed a line, even if the author felt provoked. The mutual friends think the author is at fault because she's criticizing the friend's lifestyle, even if it's true. \n\nI should consider if there were other ways to respond. Maybe the author could have addressed the friend's behavior without disclosing personal truths. But since the friend kept pushing, maybe the author felt cornered. Also, the friend's comments were about the author's job, which the friend tried but didn't succeed in doing. Maybe there's some jealousy or insecurity here.\n\nThe author's response was factual but potentially hurtful. Even if the friend's situation is making it hard to find a partner, stating it bluntly might not be the best approach. However, the author was defending herself against a friend who was being mean. The friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was hurtful, but the author might have felt that the insults were worse. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, friends often have different boundaries. The author might have overstepped by addressing the friend's issues directly, even if it's true. The friend's behavior was problematic, but the author's response might have been too harsh. So there's a balance between defending oneself and being considerate of others' feelings. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the friend was being rude, the author's response was a direct and personal attack that could have been avoided. There might have been better ways to set boundaries without revealing such a sensitive truth. However, some might argue that the author was justified. But considering the mutual friends' reactions and the potential for hurting the friend, the author's approach might have been inappropriate even if they were provoked.\n"
