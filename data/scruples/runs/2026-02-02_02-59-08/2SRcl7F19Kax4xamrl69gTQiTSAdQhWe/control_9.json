It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers and no child support. The friend was constantly insulting the author for two years, making comments about her weight, job, and dating life. The author finally snapped and gave a honest reply, which the friend took as an insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend was making repeated, hurtful comments over two years. The author tried to brush them off with generic responses. When the friend kept pushing and asking for the truth, the author responded with what they believed to be the reason. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a valid and constructive way to address the situation. The author's statement points out a specific issue (multiple children with different fathers and no child support) as a barrier to the friend's dating life. While that might be a factual observation, the way it's delivered could be seen as judgmental or insensitive. Even if the statement is true, it's possible that the friend already knows this and might feel criticized, leading to her anger. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are now side-eyeing the author, accusing them of privilege. This might be because the author's comment could be perceived as blaming the victim, even if the author's intention was to give an honest answer. The author might not realize how their words could come across as condescending or dismissive of the friend's struggles.\n\nThe author's background includes working in the adult industry, which the friend mocks. The author's job and personal situation are different, but the friend's comments are not valid. However, responding with a direct critique of the friend's personal life might not be the best approach, even if the friend is being rude. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend was in the wrong for making constant insults. However, the author's response might have crossed a line by attacking the friend's personal choices, even if it's a perceived truth. The author could have addressed the friend's behavior without being judgmental, perhaps by setting boundaries or clearly calling out the insults without making personal attacks.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to be honest, but the method might have been unkind. The question is whether honesty justifies the delivery. In friendships, even if someone is being rude, responding with more rudeness can escalate the conflict. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for defending themselves, but the way they did it could be seen as tactless. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in a gray area, but considering the friend's ongoing behavior, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was problematic. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the friend was rude, the author's response was a personal attack rather than a boundary-setting one.\n"
