It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who has five kids with different fathers and keeps making insulting comments to the author. The author finally snaps and tells her that having five kids with different dads and no child support makes it hard to find a partner. The friend gets upset, and now mutual friends are saying the author is in the wrong for being entitled and having \"skinny privilege.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was justified. The friend has been making personal, low-quality insults for two years, so the author was defensive. The key point is whether the author's truthful response was appropriate. The author points out a factual issue (five kids by different dads, no support) which is a real challenge in dating, so maybe that's a valid point. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. Even if the truth is valid, how it's said matters in relationships.\n\nThe mutual friends are criticizing the author for being entitled and implying that the author's own situation (like her job in the adult industry) is more privileged. But the author argues that she's worked hard and isn't privileged. There's a disconnect here; the friends might be projecting or not understanding the author's perspective.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of intent, the author was trying to be honest after years of insults. However, the method of communication might have been unkind. Even if the underlying message is true, it's possible that the author could have phrased it more sensitively. But given the context of two years of insults, maybe the author's frustration is justified.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at intent, impact, and whether there was a better way to handle it. The author's response was direct and might have been hurtful, but it was in response to ongoing insults. The friend's behavior is questionable as well, with the constant negativity and insults. However, the author's directness could be seen as crossing a line, even if the truth is accurate. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the way the truth was delivered could have been harsher than necessary. Even if the friend's behavior was inconsiderate, the author could have handled it with more empathy. However, some might argue that the friend's constant insults gave the author reason to respond honestly. The community typically frowns on unkindness regardless of context, so maybe A is the right choice here."
