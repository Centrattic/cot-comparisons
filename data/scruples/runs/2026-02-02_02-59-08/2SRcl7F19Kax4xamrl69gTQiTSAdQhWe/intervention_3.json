It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her single status is due to having five kids by different fathers. The friend had been making a lot of insulting comments, and the author finally responded with what they considered the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was making personal, hurtful remarks about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush these off and even gave advice, but when the friend kept pushing, the author felt compelled to address the root cause they believed was affecting her dating life\u2014her five children with different fathers. \n\nThe author's response was direct and possibly harsh, but it was a reaction to years of insults. The key points are the friend's behavior and the author's intent. The friend's comments were clearly low-quality and personal, which might have pushed the author to respond in kind. However, even if the friend was being insulting, does that justify making a direct accusation about her personal life? \n\nThe author's statement about the five kids being a barrier to relationships is a factual observation, but it might come off as judgmental or insensitive, especially if delivered without tact. The friend's reaction was anger and hanging up, which suggests the message was received as an attack rather than constructive feedback. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions also indicate that the author's statement was perceived as harmful. They mentioned \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement, implying that the author's words were hurtful and not supportive. Even if the author had a hard time, the way they responded may have crossed a line. \n\nAdditionally, the author's work in the adult industry and the friend's past attempts at the same job add another layer. The author might have felt defensive about their job, but bringing up the friend's child support issues could be seen as using personal information to deflect or counterattack. \n\nIn conflict resolution, it's important to address issues without attacking the other person. The author's response was direct and to the point, but it might have been more effective to express their feelings without blaming the friend. Phrases like \"I feel hurt when you say those things\" instead of directly calling out her situation could have been a better approach. \n\nConsidering all factors, while the friend's behavior was poor, the author's response was also unkind and contributed to the conflict. The author might have been justified in defending themselves, but the method used was likely unhelpful and damaging to the friendship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they responded, even if the underlying issue had validity.\n"
