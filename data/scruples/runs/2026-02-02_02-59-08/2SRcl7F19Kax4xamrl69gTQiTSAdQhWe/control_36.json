It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has five kids by different fathers and is single, and the friend has been making insulting comments about the author. The author finally tells her that having five kids with different dads and no child support is making it hard for her to find someone. The friend gets angry and the mutual friends are now side with the friend, saying the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author mentions that the friend has been making personal, sometimes hurtful comments for two years. The author tried to brush them off but eventually snapped. The key here is whether the author's response was justified given the context. \n\nThe friend's behavior\u2014repeated insults about the author's weight, dating life, and job\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response points out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulties in relationships. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author for not having \"privilege\" and being entitled. But is the author really in the wrong here?\n\nThe author might have overstepped by pointing out their friend's personal life, but the friend had been making similar attacks. The author's response was in response to years of insults. However, even if the friend was wrong, the author's approach might have been too harsh or public. Maybe there was a better way to address the issue without making a direct accusation. \n\nAlso, the friend's five different fathers and lack of child support could be sensitive information. The author bringing that up might have crossed a line, even if it's the truth. Sometimes, even if something is true, the way it's delivered matters. The friend might have felt attacked rather than helped.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was just trying to give an honest answer to a question that had been asked repeatedly. The friend's own behavior might have contributed to the situation. But the friends are now taking her side, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of social norms, calling out a friend's personal choices, especially in a way that could be seen as blaming, might be considered unkind. The author could have expressed concern without being so direct. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author was defending themselves against ongoing insults, maybe they're not in the wrong (B). \n\nI need to weigh the friend's history of insults against the author's response. If the friend's comments were truly hurtful and the author was trying to be honest, perhaps the answer is B. But the way it was delivered might have been too harsh. Hmm. Maybe the author's intent was to help but the method was poor. So, the author is in the wrong because they could have addressed it differently.\n"
