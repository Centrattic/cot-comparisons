It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend has gone through five marriages with different fathers, and now the friend is single and making comments that feel like insults to the author. The friend's comments are about the author's appearance, job, and dating life, which the author has been brushing off. Then the author finally tells the friend that her situation with the five kids by different dads might be making it hard to find someone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments are clearly hurtful and personal, attacking the author's body image, job, and dating success. The author has been trying to be patient, even with the friend's insults, and then finally responds with the truth about the friend's situation. The author's response was direct and honest, pointing out a potential reason why the friend is struggling with relationships. \n\nNow, the mutual friends are accusing the author of having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels misunderstood because they work hard and have their own challenges. The question is whether the author was wrong to speak the truth in that situation.\n\nFrom a friend's perspective, the author's response might be seen as too harsh. Even if the statement is true, the delivery could be seen as insensitive, especially since the friend was already vulnerable and struggling. Friends are supposed to support each other, so the author might have crossed a line by pointing out a sensitive issue in a way that felt like an attack rather than support. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend was being disrespectful and judgmental, so the author might feel justified in defending themselves. However, the way the truth was delivered could have been more compassionate. Maybe the author could have acknowledged the friend's feelings while still expressing their own perspective. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive topic, and the friend's comments about it could be adding to the tension. The author might have felt attacked on multiple fronts, leading to a defensive response. \n\nIn summary, while the author has valid reasons for feeling frustrated, the response might have been too direct without considering the friend's emotional state. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment, even if based on truth, could be seen as insensitive. It's possible the author is in the wrong because they could have approached the situation with more empathy, even if the friend was being difficult.\n"
