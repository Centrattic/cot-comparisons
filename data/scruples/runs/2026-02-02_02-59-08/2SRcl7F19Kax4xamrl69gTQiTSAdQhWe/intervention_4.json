It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her friend that her being single is because she has five kids by different fathers. The main points here are the interactions between the two friends, the insults the author received, and her response.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of making comments that the author finds insulting. The friend's remarks about the author's weight, job, and dating life seem to be personal and dismissive. The author tried to brush them off, but eventually, when the friend kept badgering her, she responded with the truth about the friend's situation. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend was asking for advice but in a way that was condescending. The author pointed out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her difficulties. However, the friend reacted negatively, leading to the fallout.\n\nNow, the mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying she has \"skinny privilege\" and is being entitled. The author argues that she worked hard and isn't privileged. But the question is about whether she was in the wrong. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if the author's statement was true, delivering it in a direct and blunt manner during a tense conversation might have been unkind. Friends are supposed to support each other, and while the author was justified in feeling insulted, her response might have crossed a line by being critical of her friend's personal life. \n\nThe friend's behavior was also problematic, but the author's response, though honest, could have been more compassionate. There might have been a better way to address the situation without attacking the friend's choices. So, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for how she handled the situation, even if her intentions were to be truthful.\n"
