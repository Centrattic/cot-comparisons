It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their friend the truth about her situation. The friend has been making hurtful comments, and the author finally snaps and calls out her friend's actions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend has a history of making insults about the author's weight, job, and relationships. The author tried to brush them off for two years, giving vague responses. Then, when the friend asks another question, the author responds by pointing out her five kids with different fathers and no child support. The friend reacts angrily and hangs up. Now, mutual friends are blaming the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled.\n\nThe core issue is whether the author was wrong to confront the friend about her situation. The author's intent was to be honest, but the friend took it as an insult. The author also mentions that the friend tried to work in the same industry, implying that the friend has some experience there, which might add context.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author tried to be supportive, but the friend's comments were toxic. The author's response was direct and might have been a valid observation, but it's possible that the way it was delivered was harsh. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment might have come across as judgmental or hurtful, even if it was true.\n\nAlso, the author's own explanation about their situation (working hard, having an MBA, etc.) could be a defense against the accusations of being privileged. But the question is about whether the author was in the wrong for making that statement. \n\nIn many cases, calling someone out for their own behavior can be seen as harsh, especially if it's done in the heat of the moment. Even if the comment was truthful, it might not have been the right approach. The friend's behavior was problematic, but the author's response might have been too direct, leading to the fallout. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's response was a justified confrontation of the friend's behavior or if it crossed a line. Given that the mutual friends are siding with the friend and the author is now isolated, it's possible that the author's approach was too blunt or triggered the friend's insecurities. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because even though the friend was being insulting, the response was a direct attack on the friend's personal life, which could be seen as unkind despite being factual.\n"
