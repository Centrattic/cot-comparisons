It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is because she has five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author over two years. The author has been brushing them off but finally responded by pointing out the friend's situation. The friend took offense and ended the conversation. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and were wrong to say that.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend's behavior was clearly hurtful and insulting, but does that justify the author's blunt reply?\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the friend's situation (multiple kids with different fathers, no child support) makes it hard to find someone. Is this a fair assessment? Well, it's a possible factor, but is it the only reason or even a major one? Also, the author's comment might come off as judgmental or blaming the friend for her own situation. Even if there's some truth to it, the way it's delivered could be seen as attacking her rather than offering support.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was justified in responding that way. The friend was being insulting, but the author's response might have crossed a line by focusing on the friend's life choices in a way that could be hurtful. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was perceived as judgmental, possibly even privileged, even if the author feels they aren't.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement about the friend's child support issue could be a sensitive topic. While it's a factual statement, pointing it out in the context of why she's single might be seen as invalidating her experiences. People might feel that the author is oversimplifying the friend's situation and not considering other factors (like the friend's personal choices, societal pressures, etc.).\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the insults, but the method might not have been the best. A more constructive approach could be offering support or understanding instead of pointing out the friend's flaws. The author's response could be seen as cutting off communication rather than resolving the conflict.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, friends often have boundaries about what they can discuss. The author might have thought they were being honest, but honesty doesn't excuse hurtful language that undermines someone else's circumstances. Also, the friend's history of multiple divorces and children is personal, and commenting on that could be crossing a line, regardless of the truth.\n\nConsidering all these points, even if the author's statement has some merit, the way it was delivered and the context of their friendship suggests that the author was in the wrong. The mutual friends' reactions back up the idea that the comment was inappropriate and hurtful. The author's frustration is understandable, but the response wasn't the right approach.\n"
