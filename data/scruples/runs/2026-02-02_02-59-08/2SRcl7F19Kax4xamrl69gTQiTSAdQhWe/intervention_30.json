It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are affecting her dating life. \n\nFirst, the friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments. The author tried to brush them off but finally snapped. The friend's comments are clearly mean and personal, attacking the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author's response was to point out the friend's situation as the possible reason for her dating struggles.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author crossed a line. The friend was being rude, so the author felt justified in responding with the truth. However, even if the friend was being mean, the author's response might have been a personal attack in return. The key here is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to handle the situation.\n\nThe mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author argues they're not privileged and have worked hard. But the friends feel the author's comment was harsh and not helpful. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, even if the friend was wrong, the author's response might not have been constructive. Calling someone out for their life choices can backfire, especially if not done with empathy. The author might have been trying to help but in a way that came off as judgmental.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior was clearly problematic, but the author's response could have been more tactful. Instead of directly pointing out the friend's situation, maybe addressing the insults without attacking her personal life. \n\nSo, while the friend was in the wrong for the insults, the author's response might have been too harsh. The right answer here is that the author is partially wrong for responding with a personal attack, even if they were provoked. The key is that both parties have issues, but the author could have handled it better.\n"
