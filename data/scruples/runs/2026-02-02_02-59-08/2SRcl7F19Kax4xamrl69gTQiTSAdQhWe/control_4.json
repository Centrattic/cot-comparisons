It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been divorced five times, each time with a different father for her kids. The friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting, like questioning why the author is successful in dating while she isn't. The author finally tells her that it's because she has five kids with different dads and none of the fathers are paying child support, making it hard for someone to accept her. The friend gets angry and hangs up, and now mutual friends are saying the author is in the wrong, talking about privilege and entitlement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The friend has been making personal and hurtful comments for two years, and the author has been brushing them off. Then, when the friend makes another comment, the author responds with something that points out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her dating struggles. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a valid and honest answer to the friend's question, or if it was a hurtful jab. The author says they were tired of the insults and felt it was the truth. However, even if it's true, the way it's delivered might be considered harsh. The friend might feel that the author is blaming her for her own situation, even if it's true. \n\nAlso, the mutual friends are pointing out that the author has some privilege (like not being underweight) and that they're being entitled. The author defends themselves by saying they worked hard and aren't privileged. But in the context of the friend's life, which includes multiple divorces and single parenthood, the author's comment might come off as dismissive or judgmental. \n\nEven if the author's intention was to give a truthful answer to the friend's question, the timing and the context (after two years of insults) might make it seem like a retaliation rather than a helpful insight. Friends are supposed to support each other, and pointing out someone's flaws in that context can be damaging. \n\nMoreover, the friend's situation is complex and might have deeper issues that the author isn't considering. The author's response, while possibly true, could be perceived as reducing her struggles to just the issue of multiple children from different fathers, which isn't fair or empathetic. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for responding in a way that was hurtful, even if it was a truthful observation. The friend's behavior was problematic, but the author's response could have been more compassionate. There might have been a better way to address the friend's question without attacking her situation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the response was unkind and contributed to the conflict.\n"
