It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers are affecting her chances of dating. The friend had been making personal and sometimes insulting comments about the author's dating life and job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had been making snide remarks for two years, and the author finally responded by pointing out her situation. The author's response was direct and maybe harsh, but it was in response to ongoing insults.\n\nThe author mentions that they work in the adult industry but also have a stable income and an MBA. The friend tried the same job but perhaps didn't succeed. The mutual friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" or being entitled, which might not align with the author's actual experiences.\n\nNow, the key points are whether the author's response was justified. The friend's questions were invasive and insulting, so the author might have felt cornered. However, the response about her children and child support could be seen as hitting below the belt. The author's friends are now defending the friend, suggesting they feel the author overstepped.\n\nIn terms of friendship, honesty is important, but timing and delivery matter. The author's reply might have been truthful, but it's possible a more empathetic approach could have been taken. The friend's situation is undoubtedly complex, and the author's comment about needing someone to accept her situation could be valid, but delivered in a confrontational way.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions might be influenced by their perception of the situation, possibly not seeing the full context of the two years of insults. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way the truth was delivered might have been insensitive.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for the manner in which they responded, even if the content had some truth. The better approach could have been to address the behavior without attacking the friend's personal choices, perhaps focusing on how the comments made the author feel instead of making a judgment about her family situation.\n"
