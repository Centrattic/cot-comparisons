It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend who has gone through five marriages and is now single, and she keeps asking the author questions that come off as insults. The author finally responds by pointing out that having five kids with different fathers without child support might be a barrier to finding someone new. The friend reacts angrily, and mutual friends are now criticizing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were personal and seemed to be attacking the author's appearance and lifestyle, implying that the author's success in relationships is due to being skinny or being a \"basic blonde.\" The author tried to brush off the insults for two years but finally snapped by addressing the friend's situation directly.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's response was justified. The author's comment was based on the observation that the friend's history of multiple children with different fathers and no child support could make it harder for someone to commit. Is that a valid point or an insensitive one?\n\nOn one hand, the author was responding to ongoing insults and felt that their friend's situation was a relevant factor. They might have thought they were being honest and pointing out a realistic barrier. On the other hand, bringing up such a sensitive topic might be seen as crossing a line, even if it's true. The friend's past is complicated and potentially stigmatized, so the author's comment could have been hurtful regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was insensitive. They mention \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement, which implies that the author's response was perceived as judgmental. The friend's history of multiple marriages and single parenthood is a personal matter, and the author may not have the right to make that public or use it as a comeback, even if it's true.\n\nThe author also works in the adult industry, which might be a point of contention with the friend, as she tried to do the same. However, the friend's insults about the author's job and appearance might have been the root of the conflict. The author's response was a direct counter to the friend's own issues, which could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation.\n\nIn terms of friendship, honesty is important, but so is tact. The author might have felt justified in finally speaking up after two years of being insulted, but the way they chose to respond could have been harsher than necessary. A better approach might have been to set boundaries earlier or address the friend's behavior without attacking her personal history.\n\nSo, weighing the situation, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their response was likely poorly handled. They were responding to repeated insults, but their reply targeted a sensitive and personal issue, leading to further conflict. The mutual friends' reactions highlight the potential insensitivity of the comment. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong, even if their intent was to be truthful."
