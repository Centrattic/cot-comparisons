It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been making hurtful comments about the author for two years, like implying their success in dating is because they're skinny or because they're \"basic.\" The author tried to brush off these insults but eventually snapped by pointing out the friend's situation with the kids and child support. Now, the mutual friends are defending the friend, saying the author had it easy, and the author is upset about that.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was right to respond the way they did. The friend was being insulting, but the author's response was also a personal attack. The author's comment about the friend's kids and child support seems like a direct hit at her personal life. \n\nI should consider if the author had other ways to respond without being judgmental. Maybe pointing out the behavior without attacking her situation? The friend's comments were rude and possibly untrue, but the author's response might have crossed a line. \n\nAlso, the author's friend is struggling with personal issues, and the author's comment might have been a trigger. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's response could be seen as unkind. However, the author was defending themselves after ongoing insults. \n\nThe key here is whether the response was an appropriate defense or an overreaction. Since the author was tired of the insults and felt they were being attacked, their response might be seen as a justified defense. But pointing out someone's personal life in a judgmental way, even if true, might not be the best approach. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because they could have responded differently. However, they were also on the receiving end of insults. It's a bit of a gray area, but the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was harsh. So, maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong for making a personal attack instead of addressing the insults in a different way.\n"
