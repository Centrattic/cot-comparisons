It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend that she's single because she has five kids by different fathers. The friend had been making a lot of comments that the author found insulting over two years. The author's friend would ask things about how the author got a man at 30 with kids, implying it's because they're skinny, and other similar remarks.\n\nSo the author finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation with five kids and no child support, suggesting that's a reason why she's having trouble dating. The friend got upset, hung up, and now mutual friends are saying the author is privileged and a bad friend. The author feels they weren't being privileged and worked hard for their success, and they're also in the adult industry but have a stable arrangement with their kids' father. They're wondering if they were wrong to say that and if there's a better way.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was appropriate. The friend was making repeated, hurtful comments, possibly projecting her own insecurities. The author tried to brush it off but felt cornered. When the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer, which caused an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about how to respond to hurtful comments. The author's friend's behavior is problematic, but the author's response might have been confrontational. Even if the truth is that the friend's situation affects her dating life, delivering it in the middle of an argument or when the friend is clearly sensitive about it might have been the wrong approach. \n\nAlso, mutual friends criticizing the author for \"skinny privilege\" and entitlement suggests they felt the author's comment was dismissive. The friend's situation, while not ideal, might be more complex. The author's reply could come off as judgmental, especially if the friend is already struggling and seeking support. \n\nEven if the friend is making untrue or low-quality insults, the author might have better addressed it by not engaging in the same negative tone. A better approach could have been to set boundaries, explain their hurt feelings, or redirect the conversation without attacking the friend's personal choices. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to be honest, but the method of delivering that honesty might have been unkind. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They could have handled it more compassionately without attacking the friend's circumstances, even if those circumstances were a factor in her dating life.\n"
