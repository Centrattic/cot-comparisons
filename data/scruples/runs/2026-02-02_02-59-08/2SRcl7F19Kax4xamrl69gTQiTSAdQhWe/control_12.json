It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids by different fathers is why she's single. The friend had been making insulting remarks about the author for two years, and the author finally snapped by pointing out the friend's situation. The mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, saying the author was entitled and has \"skinny privilege,\" among other things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's friend was repeatedly making personal attacks, which the author tried to brush off. The friend's behavior was clearly inconsiderate and hurtful. The author felt that after enduring these insults for a long time, they had to respond with the truth, which they believed was the reason the friend was single.\n\nBut the question is whether the author was right to say that. The key factors here are: was the author's response justified, and did it cross the line into being hurtful or judgmental? The friend's comment about the author's job in the adult industry and the author's own situation (two kids with one dad, stable custody, working in a job that she manages well) are important context.\n\nThe author's response was direct and pointed out a specific issue (five kids with different fathers and no child support) as a barrier to finding a partner. Is it fair to point that out? Well, sometimes people do need honest feedback, even if it's hard to hear. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh, especially after a history of insults. Also, the author's friend took it as an insult and hung up, indicating the conversation turned negative.\n\nBut the mutual friends are now blaming the author, suggesting issues like \"skinny privilege.\" The author argues they're not privileged and have worked hard. The problem here might be that the author called out their friend's situation in a way that was perceived as judgmental, even if it was true. Friends might expect a more compassionate approach rather than a blunt truth.\n\nAnother angle: the friend was being insincere and maybe projecting her own insecurities. The author's frustration is understandable, but responding with a direct accusation might have been the wrong approach. Maybe a more empathetic way to address the friend's issues without being confrontational would have been better.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention was to be honest, but the method might have been inappropriate, especially given the context of ongoing insults. The author could have been more sensitive in their response. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the truth was spoken, the delivery and the context of the prior interactions may have made it an unkind or unhelpful response. However, some might argue the author had the right to speak up after enduring the insults. But in terms of social norms and friendship dynamics, blunt truths without empathy can come across as harsh, leading to the author being in the wrong.\n"
