It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her having five kids with different fathers is why she can't get dates. The friend was making a lot of insulting comments, and the author finally snapped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made repeated negative comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses, but eventually, when the friend asked again, the author gave a candid answer pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her struggles. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior over two years of insults, the author's attempts to deflect, and the final honest reply. The author's response was direct and pointed out a factual issue, but it might have come off as harsh or judgmental. However, the friend's actions were also problematic with the constant insults. \n\nNow, considering social norms and friendship dynamics, friends are supposed to support each other. The author's friend was being unkind and judgmental, which can be hurtful. The author's response, while direct, was in response to years of negative comments. But the way it was delivered\u2014calling out the friend's situation in a conversation that's meant to be supportive\u2014might have crossed a line. \n\nThe mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting that the author's comment was insensitive, possibly because they feel it was a personal attack. The author defends themselves by saying they were just being honest and that they're not privileged. However, the timing and method of delivering that honesty might matter. Even if the truth is valid, the way it's said can affect how it's received. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's behavior was toxic, but the author's response might not have been the healthiest way to address it. There could have been a more compassionate way to express the same sentiment without turning it into an insult. So, while the friend started it with her comments, the author's response might still be seen as contributing to the conflict. \n\nTherefore, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were defending themselves from ongoing insults, but the way they expressed it could have been more constructive. However, since the question is a yes/no, considering the typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, the author might be seen as the antagonist here because their response escalated the situation and was a direct jab, even if it was in response to years of provocation. So, the answer could lean towards A (Yes), but with some caveats. However, the user's situation is complex.\n"
