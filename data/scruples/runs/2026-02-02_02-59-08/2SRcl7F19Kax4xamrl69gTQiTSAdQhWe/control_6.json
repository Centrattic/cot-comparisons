It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author has a friend who went through five divorces and has five kids with different fathers. The friend has been making a lot of insulting comments towards the author for two years, questioning how the author managed to have a man and kids at 30, making fun of her weight, her job, and her dating life. The author kept brushing off these insults with polite responses. Eventually, when the friend asked again, the author finally told her that the problem is the five kids with different dads and no child support, which makes it hard for someone to commit. The friend got angry and hung up. Then, the author's mutual friends are saying she's in the wrong, accusing her of being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's response. The friend was being consistently insulting for two years. The author tried to handle it calmly but eventually couldn't take it anymore. The author's response was pointing out the friend's situation as the reason for her difficulty in dating. Is that a valid response or an attack?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified in pointing out the truth that having multiple children with different fathers without child support could make it hard for someone to commit. It's a factual observation. However, the friend was already being insulting, and the author's response might come off as blaming or shaming her, which could be seen as the author projecting their own insecurities or passing judgment. Also, the author's friends are criticizing the author for being entitled and not understanding the friend's situation.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the insults. The friend's comments were personal and low, so the author's response was a direct confrontation. The author might have thought it was time to call out the friend's behavior. But in doing so, the author might have crossed a line by making a direct accusation, even if it's true. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was taken as harsh and not supportive, which could be seen as a breach of friendship norms.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their own challenges, like working in the adult industry, having an MBA, and single parenthood. But the friends are saying that the author's situation is different and that they have \"privilege.\" This could be a factor in how the situation is perceived by others. However, whether that's accurate or not is part of the debate.\n\nThe key question is whether the author was justified in saying that the friend's situation was the problem, despite the insults. If the author had a valid point, but the way they communicated it was unkind or unnecessarily hurtful, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if the friend was being mean for so long, and the author was just defending themselves by pointing out the obvious, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The author had a right to feel hurt by the insults and might have had a valid reason to confront the friend. However, the way they framed the response could be seen as attacking the friend's personal life, which is a sensitive issue. The mutual friends' criticism might be based on the idea that the author should have handled the situation more gracefully, perhaps by setting boundaries without directly shaming the friend. \n\nIn AITA questions, the community often looks at whether the action was inconsiderate or cruel. If the author's comment was a direct and personal attack, even if true, it might be seen as AITA. On the other hand, if the author was just stating a fact that the friend's behavior leads to their situation, it's a different perspective.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because even though the friend was being insulting, the author's response was a personal attack on the friend's life choices, which is not the appropriate way to handle it. Friends are supposed to support each other, and the author's response might have been too harsh, even if the friend was being difficult. The mutual friends' reaction also indicates that the community perceives the author's actions as crossing a line.\n"
