It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has five kids by different fathers and is single, and the author told her that her situation is making it hard for someone to find a partner. The friend took it as an insult and ended the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author mentions that the friend has been making hurtful comments for two years, asking things that insult the author's appearance and dating life. The author tried to brush them off and give advice, but when the friend kept asking, the author finally responded with the truth about the five kids and different dads.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to address the situation. The author's intention was to be honest, but the friend's reaction was negative. The mutual friends are now side with the friend, saying the author is privileged and a bad friend. \n\nI should consider if the author's statement was a valid critique or an attack. The author is pointing out a fact that could be a barrier to finding a partner, but doing so might come off as judgmental. Even if the statement is true, the delivery and context matter. The author was responding to years of insults, which might have made the situation more charged.\n\nAlso, the friend's personal situation is complex, with multiple children and no child support. The author's comment might be seen as blaming her for her circumstances, which could be hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way it was phrased could be perceived as attacking the friend's choices or lifestyle, which isn't constructive.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions their own challenges and hard work, but the friend's friends are telling her she's being unkind. It's possible that the author overstepped by making a personal comment about her friend's personal life, even if it's true. The friend might have felt criticized for her life choices, which can be sensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending themselves against constant insults and trying to set a boundary. But maybe there was a better way to address the issue without pointing out the friend's situation in a way that could be seen as judgmental. Perhaps a more empathetic approach would have been better, even if the author was tired of the insults.\n\nIn summary, while the author had a hard time with the friend's comments, their response might have been too direct and could have been perceived as an attack on the friend's personal life, which is a sensitive area. The author might have been in the wrong in how they communicated their point, even if they felt justified.\n"
