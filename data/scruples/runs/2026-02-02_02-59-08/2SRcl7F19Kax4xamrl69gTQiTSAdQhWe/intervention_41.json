It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an analysis based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making a lot of hurtful comments over two years, attacking the author's body, dating life, and work. The author kept brushing these off, giving advice like focusing on oneself. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds by pointing out that the friend's five kids with different fathers might be a barrier to finding someone. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being a bad friend, even though the author mentions they work hard and aren't actually skinny.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend was being insulting for a long time, the author finally responded with a truthful but blunt comment, and the friends are now taking the friend's side. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was justified. The friend's behavior was pretty toxic\u2014repeated insults, maybe even passive-aggressive. The author tried to deflect and support, but when pushed, they gave a direct answer. The problem is that while the author might have been defending themselves, calling out the friend's situation as a reason for her being single could come off as judgmental. Even if the truth is that having multiple children with different fathers is a challenge, the way it's said might have been hurtful. The author might have crossed a line by being honest in a way that's not supportive, especially if it's meant to put the friend in her place. Also, the friends pointing out \"skinny privilege\" might be trying to say that the author isn't facing the same struggles, even if they're not actually skinny. The author's job in the adult industry might be a sensitive point too, but they mention that the friend tried it as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was being rude and attacking for a long time. The author might feel justified in finally standing up for themselves. However, the response might have been too harsh. Maybe there was a better way to address the issue without being so direct. Also, the friends' criticism could indicate that the author's approach wasn't the best in terms of friendship dynamics. Even if the truth is that the friend's situation is a barrier, the delivery might have been what caused the fallout.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a judgmental comment that, while factually true, wasn't supportive and could have been more compassionate. The friend was wrong to insult, but the author's response might have been the last straw in a toxic friendship. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because even if the friend started it, the author's response was harmful and not constructive.\n"
