It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids by different fathers is why she's single. First, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe friend has been making insulting comments about the author for two years. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses. Then, when the friend kept asking why the author is successful in dating, the author finally responded by pointing out her situation with the kids and child support. The friend got upset and hung up. Now mutual friends are saying the author is wrong, citing privilege.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was responding to ongoing insults, gave a direct answer that called out the friend's situation, and now faces backlash. The question is whether this response was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author was defending themselves against insults and pointing out a factual reason that might affect the friend's dating life. The friend's actions (multiple children with different fathers) could indeed make it harder to find a stable partner. The author didn't attack the friend for it but stated a truth that the friend was ignoring.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response might have come across as judgmental. Even if the statement is true, delivering it in a way that feels like an insult could be hurtful. The friend's history of making snide comments might have made the author defensive, but responding with a blunt truth might not have been the most empathetic approach. Also, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's words might have been perceived as insensitive, especially if they were used to deflect from the friend's own issues without offering support.\n\nAnother angle: the author's own situation. They have kids from one father and a different job. The friend's insults about the author's job might have added to the tension. But the main issue is the response to the friend's question. The author's answer was honest but perhaps not compassionate enough. Maybe a better approach would have been to address the friend's behavior first and then offer the truth with more empathy, or to set boundaries without attacking.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was justified in their response. Since the friend was the one making the initial insults and the author was finally addressing them, some might argue the author had a right to respond. However, the way it was delivered might have been harsh. The friends' reactions indicate that the author's words were hurtful, even if they were factual. The author might not be in the wrong for speaking the truth, but they could have handled it more sensitively. The question is whether the truth was the right thing to say in that moment, considering the friendship and the friend's history of making fun of the author.\n"
