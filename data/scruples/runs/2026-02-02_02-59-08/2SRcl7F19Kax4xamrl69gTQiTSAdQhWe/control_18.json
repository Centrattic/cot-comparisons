It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers is why she can't get a partner. The situation involves two friends with different life circumstances.\n\nFirst, the friend has been making insults and asking condescending questions about the author's dating life, which the author has been tolerating for two years. The final straw comes when the author directly addresses the friend's situation, pointing out the challenges of having multiple children with different fathers. The friend reacts angrily, and mutual friends criticizes the author, saying they have privilege and were entitled.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend's insults were personal and hurtful, targeting the author's appearance, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush them off with polite responses. But when the friend continued to attack, the author finally responded with a truthful but blunt comment about the friend's own situation. \n\nThe key question is whether the author crossed a line. The author's response was factual, pointing out a real-life challenge the friend faces. However, even if true, delivering such a response without empathy might have been harsh. The friend was likely feeling vulnerable, and the author's comment could come off as judgmental. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend had been persistently making condescending remarks, and the author had been patient. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the comment was seen as unsympathetic, possibly because it's a sensitive topic. The author's friends might feel that the comment was too direct and invalidated the friend's feelings, even if the truth was spoken. \n\nIn terms of friendship, it's important to support each other without judgment. The author might have been justified in feeling hurt and defending themselves, but the method could have been more compassionate. Instead of pointing out the friend's issues, perhaps focusing on the friend's emotional state would have been better. \n\nSo, while the author's intention might have been to be honest, the way it was delivered could have been harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy, even if the statement was true. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
