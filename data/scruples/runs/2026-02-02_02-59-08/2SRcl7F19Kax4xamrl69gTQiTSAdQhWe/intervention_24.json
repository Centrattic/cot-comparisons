It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her multiple children with different fathers is why she's single. The friend has been making insulting comments for two years, and the author finally responds with their honest opinion. Now the mutual friends are siding with the friend, saying the author was privileged and a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has a history of making hurtful remarks, and the author has been trying to brush them off. The final straw was the friend's constant questioning and insults. The author's response was direct and addressed the root they believed was causing the friend's issues. But maybe the way they delivered it was harsh or unkind, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n\nThe author's friend has a lot going on: multiple children, no child support, which can be a significant stressor. The author's comment about her having five kids with different fathers and the difficulty in finding someone might be true, but pointing that out in a confrontational way could be seen as blaming the victim. It's possible that the author's friend needed support rather than criticism, even if the comment was based on a realistic obstacle.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions are also important. They feel the author is privileged and doesn't understand the friend's struggles. The author mentions working hard and having an MBA, but that doesn't negate the fact that their friend is dealing with a different set of challenges. The author's response might have been valid in some way, but the approach might have lacked empathy.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior was aggressive and insulting. The author had been trying to be patient but finally snapped. However, even if someone is being a jerk, the best response isn't always to attack them. There might have been a more constructive way to address the issue without making it personal.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a truth that could be hurtful and might not have considered the emotional impact on their friend. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's response could have deepened the conflict rather than resolving it. The key here is whether the response was constructive or destructive. Since the friend became furious and the friendship is now broken, it's possible the author's approach was too harsh. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
