It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by telling their friend that her situation with five kids by different fathers is why she's single. The friend had been making insulting comments about the author for two years, and finally, the author snapped and called out the friend's issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The friend had been consistently insulting the author, making comments about her weight, job, and dating life. The author tried to brush off the insults, responding with advice like \"focus on yourself.\" But after repeated taunts, the author felt justified in pointing out the friend's own problematic behavior. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable reaction to the ongoing insults. The author's statement about the friend having five kids with different fathers is a factual observation, not just a random jab. It's a valid point that having multiple children with different fathers without child support could make it harder to find a partner, especially if the friend is actively seeking a father figure. \n\nHowever, even if the statement is true, the delivery might be an issue. The author could have handled it more tactfully. Instead of bluntly stating the issue, maybe they could have expressed concern or offered support. But given the friend's history of insults and the author's attempts to deflect earlier, the author might have felt that a direct approach was necessary to stop the cycle of negativity.\n\nLooking at the responses from mutual friends, they're calling the author privileged and a bad friend. That suggests the friends felt the comment was harsh, even if true. The author's friends might be defending the friend who was criticized, but they also might be unaware of the prior insults. The author's defense is that they worked hard and are not privileged, which adds context about their own struggles.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intent was to point out the truth behind the friend's situation. Friends often have the right to be honest, especially when a friend is being self-destructive. However, the way the truth was delivered could have been more empathetic. The question is whether the author overstepped by being direct. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author was responding to long-term insults and tried to address the root cause. While the delivery might be rough, the content itself isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
