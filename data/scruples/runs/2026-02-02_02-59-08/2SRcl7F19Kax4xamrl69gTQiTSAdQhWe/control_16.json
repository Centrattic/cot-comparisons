It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that having five kids with different fathers is why she's single. The friend has been making insults for two years, and the author finally responded with what they believe is the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of making personal, potentially hurtful comments, and the author has been trying to brush them off. The final straw was when the friend asked a question that led the author to point out her situation regarding the children and child support. The author's response was factual but could be seen as a direct criticism of the friend's choices.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's intention was to be honest and stop the insults, but the way they delivered it might have been harsh. The friend's reaction was anger and hanging up, indicating that the message was received as an attack rather than constructive feedback. The mutual friends are siding with the friend, suggesting that the author's statement crossed a line, even if the content was true.\n\nI should also consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author mentions that they've been trying to be supportive by saying things like \"focus on yourself,\" but when the friend continued to push, the author felt justified in their response. However, the friend's own behavior (making insults and not accepting constructive replies) complicates things. \n\nAnother angle is the validity of the author's statement. It's true that having five kids with different fathers without child support could make finding a partner difficult. But bringing this up in a conversation where the friend was already being critical might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author's response was more about defending themselves rather than genuinely helping the friend. \n\nThe mutual friends' reactions are also important. They argue that the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is entitled. The author denies this, but the perception from the friends matters in social contexts. Even if the statement is true, the way it's delivered might make it seem like an attack, especially if the friend is already sensitive about her personal life.\n\nIn terms of friendship advice, it's often recommended to offer support and understanding rather than pointing out flaws, even if well-intentioned. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of addressing the friend's issues might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the author's response was justified or if there was a more constructive way to handle it without causing further conflict.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because, despite their intent, the response was likely hurtful and contributed to the breakdown of the friendship. While the friend's behavior was problematic, the author's direct approach might not have been the best solution, especially since the friend was already defensive and the conversation was filled with insults. The author could have chosen a more empathetic approach or set boundaries without making personal comments about the friend's choices.\n"
