It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their friend that her situation with multiple kids from different fathers is why she's single. The friend had been making repeated insults and the author finally responded with the truth, which led to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the two. The author mentions that their friend had been making personal, sometimes insulting comments over two years. The author tried to brush them off with generic advice. When the friend asked why the author has dates, the author pointed out the friend's situation as a barrier. \n\nNow, the key points here are the content of the response and the intent. The author's comment was factual\u2014having multiple children from different fathers without child support can indeed make it harder to find a partner. However, delivering this as a direct jab in response to insults might come off as hurtful, even if it's true. \n\nThe friend's reaction was an insult \"fury,\" and the author's friends are now criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. The author feels they're not privileged and worked hard for their success. However, the friends' reactions suggest that the author's response was perceived as cruel or judgmental, even if it was meant to be honest.\n\nIn terms of friendship, honesty is important, but so is compassion. The author might have gone too far by pointing out a sensitive issue in a way that felt like an attack. The friend's behavior was inappropriate, but responding in kind could escalate the conflict. The author could have approached it differently, perhaps with more empathy or support, to address the underlying issues without making the friend feel blamed.\n\nThe mutual friends' reactions indicate that the author's comment crossed a line. Even if the statement was true, the delivery and context might have been unkind. The question is whether the author had the right to make such a personal comment in response to insults. While the friend was acting out, the author's response might have been an overreaction, leading to the loss of the friendship and others' disapproval.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's response, though honest, was likely unkind and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
