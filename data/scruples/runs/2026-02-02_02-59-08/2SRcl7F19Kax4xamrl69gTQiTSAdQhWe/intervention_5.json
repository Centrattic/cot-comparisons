It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's been making hurtful comments, and the author finally responds by pointing out their friend's situation. The friend is single, has five kids with different fathers, and the author told her that this is why she's struggling to find someone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the friend has been making insulting remarks for two years. The friend's comments are not only personal but also imply that the author's success in dating is due to superficial reasons like being skinny or being a blonde. The author tried to brush these off with polite replies but finally snapped when the friend kept asking the same questions in a hurtful way.\n\nThe key point is when the author responds by pointing out the friend's situation. The author says that having five kids with different fathers and no child support makes it hard for someone to commit. The friend got angry and hung up. Now, mutual friends are criticizing the author for being privileged and insensitive.\n\nI need to determine if the author's response was justified. On one hand, the friend's comments were clearly hurtful and personal. The author might have felt that the friend was attacking her for no reason. But on the other hand, the author's response was also a personal jab. Even if the friend's situation is a contributing factor, pointing it out in that context might have been harsh, especially since it's a sensitive topic. The author could have handled it more compassionately, perhaps by explaining their own situation without attacking the friend's personal choices.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was considered harsh. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, the delivery might have been unkind. The question is whether the author had the right to make that comment in response to the insults. Maybe there's a better way to set boundaries without being offensive.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because while the friend's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response was also a personal attack. The situation might have been handled more constructively by addressing the friend's behavior without reciprocating with a hurtful comment. The author could have stood up for themselves by explaining that their dating success isn't about superficial traits and that the friend's comments are unkind, without bringing up the friend's personal situation in such a direct and potentially hurtful way.\n"
