It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her friend that her multiple children by different fathers are affecting her chances of getting a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend has a lot of kids with different dads and none of the fathers pay child support. The author is tired of the friend's insults about her dating life and work. The friend's comments were personal and maybe a bit hurtful, but the author decided to call out the friend's situation directly. The friend then got angry and the author is now facing backlash from mutual friends who say the author is privileged and in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's behavior (insulting the author), the author's response (pointing out the friend's situation as a possible reason for her dating issues), and the consequences (friendship damage and mutual friends' reactions).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The friend was making personal attacks, which is rude. The author tried to brush them off but eventually snapped. The response the author gave was honest but might have been harsh. The question is whether pointing out the friend's situation was justified or if it crossed a line.\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to set a boundary after repeated insults. On the other hand, pointing out someone's personal life, especially in a judgmental way, might not be the best approach. The author's comment could be seen as implying that the friend's choices were the root of her problems, which might not be fair or helpful. Also, the mutual friends feel that the author is being privileged, which could mean the author didn't consider the friend's struggles in the right way.\n\nI think the author's intention was to be honest, but the delivery might have been hurtful. Even if the friend was being rude, responding with a judgmental statement that singles out her situation as the problem could be seen as attacking her character. It's possible the friend's issues are more complex than just her number of kids. The author might have a valid point, but the way it was delivered likely caused more harm than good. So, the author might be in the wrong for not choosing a more empathetic approach.\n"
