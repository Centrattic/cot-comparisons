It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a friend who went through five marriages and is now single again. This friend has been making some pretty hurtful comments about the author's dating life and job. The author finally snaps and tells her that having five kids with different dads might be why she's struggling to find a partner. The friend gets upset and hangs up, and now mutual friends are saying the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The friend's comments are clearly insulting and personal. The author tried to brush them off for two years, which shows they might have given their friend the benefit of the doubt. When the author finally responds, they point out a factual issue\u2014multiple children with different fathers could be a barrier for some people. But the problem is whether it's appropriate to say that in a friendship. \n\nThe friend's behavior was hostile, but the author's response might have crossed a line. Even if the comment is true, making it in a personal and judgmental way can hurt feelings. The author's friend might have felt judged, especially if she's already in a vulnerable position. Also, the mutual friends are reacting by calling the author privileged, which suggests there's a perception that the author didn't consider the friend's situation carefully. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was being insulted repeatedly and might have felt it was time to set a boundary. The friend's comments were about the author's weight and job, which were untrue or unfair. The author's response was a direct answer to the friend's question, which was about why they have dates while the friend doesn't. \n\nBut the key issue is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to address the insults. Even if the author's statement is true, it's possible that a different approach could have been more constructive. Maybe the author could have addressed the friend's behavior first instead of giving a direct but hurtful answer. \n\nAlso, considering the friend's history, the author's comment might have triggered deeper insecurities. The author's own situation (having kids with one dad and working in a different field) might mean they don't fully understand the friend's challenges. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might have been within their right to call out the friend's behavior, but the way they did it could have been hurtful. However, since the friend was being insulting first, the author might not be entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. But given that the friend's actions were provoking, and the author's response was a direct answer to a question, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the response might not have been the best way to handle it. So, maybe the answer is A or B? Hmm.\n"
