It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who keeps asking the author questions that are insulting, and the author finally calls out their friend's situation, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend has five kids with different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The friend has been making comments about the author's body, dating life, and job. The author, after a year of brushing off these insults, finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as a reason she's having trouble finding a partner. The friend is upset, and mutual friends are now blaming the author for being privileged and a bad friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to speak the truth. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, what's the standard here? In AITA scenarios, the key is whether the author acted unreasonably. The friend was making personal attacks, and the author responded with what they considered the truth. The author's job is in the adult industry, which the friend also tried, but mutual friends are now criticizing the author for their job. However, the author's statement was about the friend's situation being a barrier to finding a partner. \n\nThe author's response was direct, but was it crossing a line? The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and untrue (like implying the author's weight is the reason she has a partner). The author's response was pointing out a factual reason: having multiple children with different fathers without child support might deter potential partners. That's a valid observation, but maybe the way it was said came off as judgmental. However, the author had been defending themselves from insults for two years. \n\nThe mutual friends are saying the author has privilege, but the author argues they worked hard. The issue here is whether the author's comment was a justified response to years of insults. The author's friend's behavior was toxic, and the author's response was a truth they believed. In AITA contexts, if someone is being bullied or insulted and finally stands up for themselves in a truthful way, it's often not considered their fault. The friends' reactions might be more about deflection or not seeing the friend's toxic behavior.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
