It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's friend has been through five marriages and is currently single, which the author attributes to her having five kids with different fathers and no child support. The friend has been making a lot of insults towards the author over two years, questioning her dating life, her weight, her job, etc. The author tried to brush off the insults by giving generic advice like \"focus on yourself.\" But when the friend asked the same question again, the author finally told her that her situation (multiple kids with different dads) is a barrier. The friend got angry and hung up. Now, mutual friends are side-eyeing the author, saying she has \"skinny privilege\" and is being entitled. The author feels wronged because she worked hard and isn't privileged, and she's upset that her honest response is seen as an insult.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The friend was being insulting and the author was defensive. The author's response, while honest, might have been a low blow. But was it in the wrong? \n\nFirst, is it okay to tell a friend the truth that could be hurtful if they're being hostile? The friend was asking leading questions that were insults. The author's response was a straightforward answer to the underlying question. However, even if the friend was being a jerk, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line. The friend's situation is personal and sensitive. Even if true, pointing out someone's flaws in the middle of a conflict can be seen as unkind, especially if the person is already struggling. The mutual friends think the author is being privileged, which might indicate that the author's tone or delivery was harsh, not just the content. The author could have addressed the issue without attacking the friend's personal life. Maybe a better approach was to set boundaries without being confrontational. So, the author's intention was to be honest, but the method might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the author's response was a justified truth or an unkind jab. In relationships, honesty is important, but it's also about how you deliver it. Since the author was defensive and the friend was already hostile, the interaction escalated. The answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong because they were responding to years of insults, but the way they responded could have been better. However, since the user is asking for A or B, the options are \"Yes, the author is in the wrong\" or \"No, they're not.\" Considering that the author told a truth that the friend was sensitive about, but did so in a confrontation, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong) because even if the friend was mean, the author's response could be seen as cruel. Alternatively, the author might have been justified in defending themselves after being insulted. It's a bit of a toss-up. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author overstepped. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
