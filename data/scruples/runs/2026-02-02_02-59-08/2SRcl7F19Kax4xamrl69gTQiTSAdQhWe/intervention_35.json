It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's friend has been divorced five times, with five kids from different fathers, none of whom pay child support. The friend has been making comments that the author finds insulting, especially about the author's dating life and job. The author finally tells her that the issue is her having five kids by different dads and no child support, which makes it hard for others to accept her. The friend gets angry and hangs up. Now mutual friends are saying the author was wrong, suggesting the author has \"skinny privilege\" and is being a bad friend.\n\nThe author is in a similar situation but with two kids from the same dad. They work in the adult industry but also have an MBA and another job. The author feels they've been working hard and that the friend's comments were untrue and low-quality, so they responded honestly.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong? Answer A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's behavior. She's been making repeated insulting comments about the author's weight, dating life, etc. The author has tried to brush them off with polite responses. Then, when the friend asks again, the author responds with a blunt truth about her situation. The friend reacts angrily and ends the call.\n\nThe author's friends are now criticizing the author, saying they have privilege and are not understanding. The author feels they're not privileged and that they've worked hard.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author crossed a line. The key point is whether the author's response was an appropriate way to handle the insults or if it was an overshare or judgment that wasn't their place.\n\nThe friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014repeated insults and pushing the author's buttons. The author's response was addressing the root cause they believed was the problem. However, in doing so, they might have made the situation worse by publicly pointing out the friend's situation, which could be seen as shaming or judgmental, even if it's the truth.\n\nIn social situations, even if someone is being irritating, the way you respond matters. The author might have felt justified, but by pointing out the friend's situation, they could have breached trust or privacy. The friend's children's fathers not paying support is a sensitive issue. Maybe the author shouldn't have brought up personal details that could be seen as private or hurtful.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's approach was not well-received. They mention \"skinny privilege,\" which the author denies. The author's friends feel the author is being entitled, which might indicate that the author's response came off as condescending or judgmental, even if they didn't intend to be.\n\nHowever, the author was tired of the insults and finally stood up for themselves. In some cases, people feel they need to confront the issue directly. But the method might have been inappropriate. Maybe a better approach would have been to address the insults without revealing potentially sensitive information about the friend's personal life, especially regarding her children's fathers and child support.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they responded with a personal truth that could be seen as an attack rather than a constructive response. Even if the friend was being rude, the author's response could have been more tactful. The friends' reactions back up the idea that the author's approach was not appropriate, possibly crossing a line into judgmental behavior despite the friend's provocations.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
