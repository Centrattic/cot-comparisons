It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who has gone through multiple divorces and now has five kids with different fathers. The author is fed up with the friend's insults and finally tells her that her situation with the kids makes it hard to find someone. The friend gets angry, and mutual friends are blaming the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making comments about the author's weight, job, and dating life, which the author has been brushing off. But after two years, the author confronts the friend about the root issue. The author's response was honest but maybe harsh. The question is whether that was justified.\n\nThe key points here are about friendship dynamics. Friends should ideally support each other, but the friend was being hostile. However, the author's response was direct and pointed out a sensitive issue. Even if the author felt insulted, responding with a critique of the friend's personal life might cross a line. The friend's actions (multiple children with different fathers) are personal choices, and the author's comment could be seen as judgmental, even if they believe it's the truth.\n\nAdditionally, mutual friends are reacting negatively, suggesting that the author's approach wasn't well-received. The author's friends are pointing to \"skin privilege\" and entitlement, implying that the author's own situation allows them to make such comments. The author's job in the adult industry and having an MBA might make their perspective different, but the way they delivered their response might have been hurtful.\n\nThe friend's behavior\u2014insulting the author repeatedly\u2014doesn't justify the author's response in a way that cuts to the core of the friend's choices. Even if the author was tired of the insults, the response was about the friend's life choices, which can be sensitive. The author might have had the right to set boundaries, but the method of doing so could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of better alternatives, the author could have addressed the insults without attacking the friend's personal circumstances. Maybe focusing on their own feelings rather than the friend's situation. Instead of saying \"you can't find someone because of your kids,\" they could have said something like, \"I feel uncomfortable when you make these comments about me. Let's talk about something else.\"\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong because the response was judgmental and potentially hurtful, even if the underlying sentiment was a reaction to provocation. Friends should communicate issues without personal attacks, especially on sensitive topics like family and relationships.\n"
