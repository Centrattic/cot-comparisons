It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids with different fathers. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's weight, job, dating life, etc., for two years. The author tried to brush it off with polite responses each time. Finally, when the friend asked again, the author gave a direct answer pointing out the friend's situation as a reason she's still single. The friend got angry and hung up. Now mutual friends are calling the author out for being privileged and a bad friend, even though the author feels they're not privileged and that the friend's comments were hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are about the context of the insults and the friend's behavior over time. The author was defending themselves after repeated attacks, which might justify their response. However, the way the author phrased it could be seen as harsh or judgmental. The friend's actions might be part of her own issues, but the author's response might have crossed a line by pointing out the friend's situation in a way that could be perceived as shaming.\n\nBut considering that the author had been insulted multiple times and finally stood up for themselves, some might argue that the response was a legitimate defense. However, the content of the response\u2014mentioning the friend's five kids with different fathers\u2014could be hurtful and stigmatizing. Even if it's true, it's a sensitive issue, and bringing it up might not be the best approach, even in the face of insults.\n\nAlso, the mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's statement was hurtful in a way that wasn't appreciated, possibly due to the friend's personal circumstances. The author's job in the adult industry might add to the perception of privilege, even if it's not the case. The author's response could be seen as invalidating the friend's struggles, even if the friend is acting out.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending themselves against untrue and low-quality insults, which might make their response more understandable. The question is whether the response was proportionate. The friend's behavior was definitely problematic, but the author's truth-telling might have been an appropriate reaction in a healthy friendship. However, in this case, the friend's behavior was hostile, and the author's response might not have been the best way to handle it.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line even if the friend was being difficult. The better approach might have been to set boundaries without attacking the friend's personal situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because their response was a direct attack that likely exacerbated the situation, even if the friend's behavior was bad.\n"
