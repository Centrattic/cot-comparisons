It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend that her being single is due to having five kids by different fathers. \n\nFirst, the friend has been making a lot of insulting comments over two years. The author has been brushing them off, but finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation. The friend then gets upset and hangs up. The mutual friends are now taking the friend's side, saying the author was mean and had \"skinny privilege,\" etc.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author was constantly on the receiving end of insults and low-quality comments. The response was a truthful statement about the friend's situation, which the author believed was the root of the problem. However, the author's truth might have been a personal attack, even if factual. \n\nThe key points are: 1) the friend was being insulting, 2) the author's response was factual but could be seen as harsh, and 3) mutual friends are now blaming the author. \n\nEven if the author was tired of the insults, responding with a personal truth might have crossed a line. The friend's actions (insults) don't justify the author's response, but the author's motivation was to be honest. However, in such situations, the way you respond matters. Telling someone they have multiple children by different fathers as a reason for being single is a sensitive topic and can come off as judgmental, regardless of the truth. \n\nAlso, the author's own situation (working in the adult industry, etc.) might make them feel judged too, but that doesn't excuse a harsh response. The mutual friends' reactions suggest that the author's comment was perceived as hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, the delivery might have been unkind. \n\nIn terms of social norms, calling out someone's personal choices, especially in a sensitive area like family and relationships, can be seen as crossing a boundary, even if it's true. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more compassionately, even if the friend was being rude first. \n\nBut then again, the friend was being insulting for two years. The author might have felt justified in finally standing up for themselves. However, the response was direct and factual, which could be seen as a low blow. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the friend was being mean, the author's response was a personal attack that might have been unkind and unnecessary, despite being truthful.\n"
