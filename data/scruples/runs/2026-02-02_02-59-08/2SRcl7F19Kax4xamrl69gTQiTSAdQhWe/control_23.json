It\u2019s because you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo I have to stop eating like you? Haha haha\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has so many dates. Guys only want basic blondes who are girly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you only talk about sex with them?!\u201d\n\nFor two years I\u2019ve brushed off the insults, and replied: \u201c You\u2019re in a small town\u201d or \u201cfocus on yourself , and someone special will come around\u201d\n\nFinally she asks for the billionth time \u201cHow did you get any dates at 30 with kids?!? You don\u2019t even have a real job! Tell me the truth- why can\u2019t I get anyone?\u201d\n\nI replied honestly and said: \u201c You have five kids with different dads and none of them pay child support. It\u2019s going to be hard for someone to accept that when you openly are looking for a father figure.\u201d\n\nThis launched her into an insult fury, and she hung up on me. \n\nFor reference: I\u2019m not skinny but I work out (healthy weight). I eat more than her, honestly, not starving. I\u2019m girly about some things I guess. I have two kids by the same dad and we split custody 50/50. I work in the adult industry, but only need to put in 8-10 hours a week to make a way better than average income. She keeps insulting my work even though she tried to do it, as well. I also have a vanilla job and an MBA. \n\nI was tired of being hit low quality and untrue insults, so I replied with what I thought was the truth.\n\nNow, all of our mutual friends are saying I have skinny privilege and such. I\u2019m entitled and don\u2019t understand what she\u2019s going through. They said it was messed up to say that and I\u2019m a shitty friend, and I get whatever I want. She\u2019s not going through anything that major. She\u2019s just dating and being a mom like I had to do. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with my mouth shut, and I\u2019m mad at everyone because I\u2019m not privileged or entitled at all- I\u2019ve worked very hard for anything and everything I have.  And side note- the girl keeps talking about her\n\nAITA for saying that? Was there a better thing to say? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their friend that her having five kids by different fathers is why she's still single. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been making insulting comments about the author's weight, job, dating life, etc. The author has been brushing them off, but finally responds by pointing out the friend's situation as the reason for her struggles. \n\nThe key points here are the nature of the insults and the appropriateness of the author's response. The friend's comments seem to be personal attacks, possibly rooted in insecurity. The author's response is a direct address of the friend's situation, which might be true but could come off as harsh.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was justified. While the friend was being insulting, responding with a personal truth about their situation might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the statement is factually accurate, it could be hurtful and not the right way to handle the situation. The author might have been trying to shut down the insults but used a method that caused further conflict.\n\nAlso, mutual friends are criticizing the author for having \"skinny privilege\" and being entitled. This suggests that others perceive the author's comments as judgmental, even if they were responding to the friend's insults. The author's job in the adult industry might make the friend's comments more sensitive, and the author's response might have been a way to defend themselves, but perhaps not the best approach.\n\nIn conflict resolution, it's often advised to avoid personal attacks even when being attacked. The author might have been trying to be honest, but the way they delivered it might have been damaging. There could be a better way to address the friend's behavior without making personal comments about her choices.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for responding with a direct and potentially hurtful truth, even if the friend was being insulting. The answer would lean towards \"Yes\" (A), as the response could be seen as crossing a boundary despite the provocation.\n"
