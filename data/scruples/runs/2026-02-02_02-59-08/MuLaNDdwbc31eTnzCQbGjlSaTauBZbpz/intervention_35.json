Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they've been loudly heckling cat-callers by making a \"booo!\" sound like a silent movie villain. They get some backlash, mostly from the cat-callers, and people around them think they're being an asshole. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. But others think they're drawing attention and making it worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful, so trying to stop it is good. But the method here is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The author is trying to use peer pressure to stop the behavior. But is it their place to do so? \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't physically confronting them, just making a loud noise. They're not engaging in violence, so that's a plus. But cat-calling is a form of harassment, and intervening is a form of support for the victim. However, the question is whether the method is appropriate. \n\nSome might argue that publicly shaming the cat-caller could escalate the situation. The author mentions that people think they're an asshole, but maybe that's because the method is inconsiderate. Also, the author is using humor or mockery, which might not be the best approach in a serious situation. \n\nAnother angle: the author's intention is to discourage the behavior, which is good. But the outcome could vary. If it's effective, then maybe it's justified. But if it makes the situation worse for the person being cat-called, like drawing more attention, then it's not helpful. \n\nAlso, the author is physically imposing, which might make others not take their threats seriously. But the main issue is the method. Is it acceptable to mock someone publicly to stop their harassment? \n\nIn some contexts, public shaming has been criticized as a form of mob justice, which isn't ideal. However, in this case, it's a small act, not a trial. The line between standing up against harassment and becoming a harasser yourself is thin here. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions might be well-intentioned but the approach could be problematic. They might not be in the wrong because they're trying to do something good, but the method could be counterproductive. However, if others perceive them as an asshole, maybe they are overstepping. It's a bit of a grey area. But since they aren't using violence and the intention is positive, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But then again, their approach could be seen as aggressive and not effective. Hmm.\n"
