Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is doing this in a big city, using a \"booo!\" to mock the cat-callers. They mention that people think they're an asshole, but their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment and disrespectful. The author is trying to address this by publicly calling out the behavior. But is their method appropriate? They're making a scene, which could escalate the situation. The author acknowledges that people think they're an asshole, so there's a social aspect to consider.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other, their method might be counterproductive. By loudly heckling, they might draw more attention to the cat-caller, which the girls mentioned as making it worse. Also, getting into confrontations could lead to more conflict. The author says they're big and no one has attacked them yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe or the best approach.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility. The author is taking it upon themselves to act as a moral authority, which can be problematic. It's possible that the cat-caller is unaware of their behavior's negative impact, but the author's reaction might not be the best way to educate them. Plus, the author admits to finding it funny, which could indicate a lack of sensitivity.\n\nLegally, unless the heckling involves threats or incitement, it might be protected speech. But socially, it's a gray area. The key is whether the action helps or hinders the goal. If the intent is to stop harassment, a more constructive approach might be better, like reporting or encouraging bystander intervention that de-escalates.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have good intentions but the method might be harmful. The question is whether the means justify the ends. Since their approach could escalate situations and draw unwanted attention, maybe they are in the wrong. But others might argue it's justified. The answer depends on balancing intent with impact.\n"
