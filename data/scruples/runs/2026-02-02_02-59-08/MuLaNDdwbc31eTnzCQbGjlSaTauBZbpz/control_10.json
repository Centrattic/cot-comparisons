Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to stop catcalling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They mention they've been doing this for two months in a big city. The methods involve loudly \"booo!\" at the cat-callers, which is similar to mocking a villain in a movie. \n\nNow, catcalling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author's action could be seen as standing up against such behavior. However, they're facing backlash from both sides\u2014some guys think they're a \"white knight\" who might get beaten up, and women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author also admits to finding it funny, which might be perceived as using the issue for personal amusement.\n\nOn one hand, confronting harassment in public can be a form of allyship, supporting those targeted. It might deter future incidents by showing disapproval. On the other hand, the method of using loud heckling might escalate the situation, putting both the author and others at risk. It could also be seen as confrontational rather than constructive. The author's approach might not align with more supportive strategies, like speaking out in a non-confrontational way or reporting the behavior.\n\nThe key points are intent vs. outcome. The author's intent is to discourage catcalling, which is positive. However, the method could be problematic if it leads to aggression or hinders a safer environment. The question is whether the means justify the end, and if the approach is effective or respectful. Since catcalling is an issue of respect and consent, the response should ideally promote safety without escalating conflict. The author's method might be seen as taking the moral high ground but in a way that's not universally accepted, hence the mixed reactions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer could hinge on whether the approach is constructive. If the author's actions are causing harm or drawing negative attention, then they might be in the wrong. However, if they're effectively supporting those targeted, they might not be. The community's mixed reactions suggest that there's no clear consensus, but the author's personal amusement complicates the justification.\n"
