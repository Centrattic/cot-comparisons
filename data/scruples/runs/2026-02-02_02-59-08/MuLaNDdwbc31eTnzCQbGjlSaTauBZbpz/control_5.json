Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months in a big city. They use a \"booo\" like a silent movie villain. The responses they get are mostly negative, with people thinking they're an asshole. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create a better atmosphere. But they're also getting backlash from both men and women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is negative. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. However, their method is public heckling. The question is whether their action crosses a line.\n\nThe author is using a confrontational approach, which might escalate the situation. The cat-caller is already in the wrong, but the author's response could be seen as vigilantism. They argue that they're creating an environment where others might also stop such behavior. But others think they're drawing more attention, which could make the victims uncomfortable or even worse. Also, some might see it as the author being a hypocrite if they have their own issues, as hinted.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is good\u2014they want to stop something harmful. On the other hand, their method might not be effective and could be counterproductive. The responses from others suggest that people see the author as an asshole, which is a red flag. Also, the author mentions being a \"big fucker\" and not facing consequences yet, but that doesn't mean it's right.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is using the right approach. Maybe there are more appropriate ways to address harassment, like reporting to authorities or supporting policies against it. Public heckling might not be the best solution because it can sometimes escalate tensions or put others at risk. The author's method could be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of doing good but in a way that respects others' rights is important. The author might be infringing on others' rights by confronting the cat-callers publicly without authority. Also, the effectiveness of their method is questionable\u2014discouraging the cat-caller through public shaming might work in some cases, but it could also harden the cat-caller's stance or make the situation more confrontational.\n\nMoreover, the author's personal enjoyment (\"I find it funny\") complicates things. It's not just about the cause but also their own satisfaction, which might be seen as self-righteousness. That could undermine their credibility and make their actions seem more like a personal vendetta than a genuine effort to help.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might be problematic. The author's actions could be considered inappropriate because they're using a confrontational and public approach that may not be effective or respectful. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The key points are the effectiveness, the potential for escalation, and the respect for others' rights in the approach.\n"
