Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a big city and has started loudly booing cat-callers. Their reason is that they find it annoying and want to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They mention that some people think they're a \"white knight\" or that they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author acknowledges that they might be an asshole but isn't sure.\n\nHmm, catcalling is a problem because it's harassment. The author is trying to address it, but their method is public confrontation. The issue here is whether their approach is appropriate. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is positive. On the other hand, heckling might escalate the situation or draw unwanted attention to the victim. The author says it's also for their own amusement, which complicates things.\n\nThe possible outcomes: if the booing makes the cat-caller stop, it's helpful. But if it leads to more confrontation or makes victims feel like they need to defend themselves, that's bad. Also, the author's size might make them less likely to be targeted, but others might not be in that position. The question is about being in the \"wrong\"\u2014so legally, probably not, but socially, there might be debates.\n\nThe options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Considering the intent is to stop harassment, but the method might not be the best. The author is taking a stand, even if the approach isn't perfect. The key is whether their action is morally wrong. Since they're trying to help and the problem exists, maybe they're not in the wrong. But others might think it's not their place. The answer probably leans B, but I need to be sure.\n"
