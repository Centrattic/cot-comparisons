Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they're loudly heckling cat-callers by making a \"booo!\" sound, like a villain in a movie. They've been doing this for two months since moving to a big city. The person is saying that cat-calling is a pet peeve and they want to discourage it by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. They also mention that people think they're an asshole, with guys saying they're a \"white knight\" and girls saying they're making things worse. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's wrong with cat-calling. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unwanted attention. So the author is trying to stand up against something that's negative. But their method is to mock the cat-caller publicly. That could have different outcomes. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to stop the harassment by making the cat-caller feel bad. Maybe they think that if people know it's frowned upon, they'll stop. But on the other hand, by getting involved, the author might be escalating the situation. If they're getting threats in return, maybe they're putting themselves at risk. Also, the people around them think they're an asshole. The argument is that by drawing attention, they might be making the victim uncomfortable too. Like, if someone is being harassed, adding more noise from another person might not help. \n\nAnother angle: Is it the author's place to intervene? Some might say that the person being harassed should handle it as they see fit, and others shouldn't insert themselves unless asked. Also, if the author is making a scene, it could potentially distract from the victim's experience. The author admits they find it funny, which might seem dismissive of the seriousness of the harassment.\n\nBut then again, the author is trying to create a culture where people can call out bad behavior. Maybe in some contexts, this is helpful. However, the effectiveness is questionable. The author's approach might not be the best way to address the issue. It's possible that more constructive methods, like reporting the harassment or supporting the victim in a respectful way, would be better. \n\nAlso, the legal aspect: Is the author's heckling within the bounds of free speech? Probably, unless it's considered threatening or inciting violence. The author says they get cussed at but no one has acted on threats. But if their response leads to a confrontation, that could be a problem.\n\nSo, weighing the intention versus the effect. The author's intention is good (stop harassment), but the method might be counterproductive. The reactions from others suggest that their approach isn't effective and might be causing more issues. The author's method might not be the right way to handle it, hence being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the cat-caller is in the wrong, the author's actions are a form of peaceful protest. But if the heckling leads to more aggression or draws negative attention, then maybe the author is overstepping.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The method of intervention might not be effective or appropriate. 2) The author could be making the situation worse for the victim. 3) There's a risk of escalation. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their approach is causing more problems than it's solving, even if their intention is good. However, some might argue they're not in the wrong because they're standing up against harassment. But given the negative feedback and possible consequences, it's more likely A.\n"
