Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author admits to doing this for two months in a big city, using a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. They get cussing and threats but haven't been physically harmed. People around them think the author is an asshole, with some saying they're a \"white knight\" and others that it makes the situation worse. The author's rationale is making the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe foster others to stop it. They also find it funny, though they acknowledge they might be an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author is trying to stop it, which on the surface seems positive. However, their method is public heckling with a \"booo,\" which might escalate the situation. The author is getting threats and curses, which suggests that their approach might be causing more confrontation than resolution. \n\nThe author's own friends and observers are split. Men think they're a white knight who might get hurt, and women think it's making things worse. The author's argument is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable could deter future behavior. But if it's leading to threats, maybe it's counterproductive. Also, the author is a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they're physically imposing, which might make others less likely to challenge them, but the threats still exist.\n\nI need to think about whether the method is appropriate. Publicly shaming someone in a confrontational way might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation, especially if the cat-caller is already hostile. The author's intention is good, but the execution might be problematic. Also, the fact that others, especially women, think it's making the situation worse suggests that the method isn't effective or is causing more harm than good.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking matters into their own hands. While cat-calling is wrong, intervening in a public, confrontational manner might not be the best way. It could lead to personal conflict, and if the cat-caller is aggressive, the author could be in danger, even if they're physically strong. The author's safety is a consideration here.\n\nAlso, the author admits to being hypocritical, as they have a pet peeve but engage in it themselves. That might suggest a lack of self-awareness. The humor they find in the situation might not align with the seriousness of the issue. Cat-calling is a serious form of harassment, and using humor in response could be seen as minimizing the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to create a positive change. If their method works in deterring the cat-caller, even temporarily, that's a positive. But if it's causing more harm (like drawing more attention, escalating the situation), then it's not helpful.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because their method is confrontational and could be exacerbating the problem rather than solving it. Even with good intentions, the approach is questionable. The fact that others, including women, think it's making things worse supports this. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
