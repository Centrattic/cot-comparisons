Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this after moving to a big city, motivated by a pet peeve against cat-calling. They use a \"booo!\" like in a movie, which sometimes gets them cursed at or threatened. People around think they're an asshole, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" and others believe they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a better environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the perpetrators. But is that justified? Public shaming can be a gray area. On one hand, it might deter the behavior, as the author hopes. On the other hand, it could escalate the situation or cause the cat-caller to react aggressively. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they can handle threats. But even so, using confrontational methods could lead to conflict. The question is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response or if they're overstepping. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. If the author's actions do reduce cat-calling without causing harm, maybe it's justified. However, if it's causing more harm (like drawing attention or making the victims uncomfortable), it's a problem. The author admits some people think they're making it worse, which is a valid concern. \n\nLegally, if the heckling is not threatening and is just verbal, it might be protected speech, but that varies by location. Ethically, it's about balancing the intent (to help) against the methods (public shaming). There's also the aspect of bystander intervention\u2014what's the most effective way to help without endangering oneself or others?\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent to stop harassment is commendable, the method of loudly heckling might not be the most effective or appropriate. It could lead to negative outcomes, so they might be in the wrong for not considering better alternatives. But others might argue that direct action is necessary. Since the answer is A or B, the user probably expects a single choice. Given the potential negative consequences and the fact that there are other ways to address harassment (like reporting or supporting the victims discreetly), the author's approach might be seen as counterproductive. So, likely A (Yes, in the wrong) because their method could exacerbate the problem despite good intentions.\n"
