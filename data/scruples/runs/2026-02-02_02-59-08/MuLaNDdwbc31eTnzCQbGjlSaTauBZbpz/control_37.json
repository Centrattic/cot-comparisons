Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is doing this to stop the behavior, but others think it's making things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention is to discourage cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They use loud \"boos\" to confront the cat-callers. On the flip side, some people think this approach is counterproductive because it might escalate the situation or draw more attention, which could make the victims feel worse.\n\nCat-calling is a serious issue. It's a form of harassment that makes people, especially women, feel unsafe. The author's motivation is to address this problem, which is commendable. But the method\u2014publicly shaming the cat-callers\u2014might have unintended consequences. If the cat-caller gets defensive or angry, they might escalate their behavior, putting the victim at more risk. Also, if the heckling leads to a confrontation, it could result in violence, as others have pointed out the threats.\n\nAnother angle is the bystander effect. The author is trying to be an active bystander, which is good. However, the method should be safe and effective. Shouting might not be the best approach. Maybe a more discreet intervention or supporting the victim without confrontation could be better. Also, some might argue that the author is inserting themselves into a situation where they could be putting others at risk if the confrontation turns physical.\n\nBut on the other hand, doing nothing is also an option. The author is taking a stand, which is important for creating a culture where such behavior isn't tolerated. However, the effectiveness of their method is debatable. It's possible that their actions are not helping the victims and might be making the situation more uncomfortable for them.\n\nI should consider whether the author's actions are considered acceptable forms of protest or if they cross into harassment. Publicly shaming someone could be seen as a form of vigilantism. Also, the author mentions being a \"fairly big fucker,\" which might be why they haven't been physically threatened yet. But others might not be so lucky, and this approach could lead to more harm if someone retaliates.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention is positive, the method might be counterproductive. The right answer might be A (they are in the wrong), because their approach could make the situation worse for the victim and others. However, there's a valid argument that they're trying to do something good. But since the question is about whether they are in the wrong, and the method might be causing more harm than good, the answer is likely A.\n"
