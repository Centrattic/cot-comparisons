Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is loudly making \"booo!\" sounds at catcallers, which is meant to mock them like a villain in a movie. He's getting some backlash, with both men and women having different opinions. Men think he's a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, while women think he's making things worse by drawing attention. His reasoning is that making the catcallers uncomfortable might discourage their behavior and create a better atmosphere. He also admits he finds it funny.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, catcalling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the catcallers. On one hand, standing up against harassment is commendable. On the other hand, his method might be seen as confrontational and possibly escalating the situation. \n\nThe key points to consider: Is his method of intervention effective or counterproductive? Public shaming can sometimes lead to more conflict. He's getting threats, which shows the catcallers are not taking it well. His size might prevent physical confrontations, but the threat remains. Also, his approach might not address the root issue and could make the environment more hostile. Women's concerns about drawing attention could be valid; it might make the victims uncomfortable seeing someone else involved. \n\nHowever, the author's intent is to discourage harassment, which is a noble goal. The question is whether his method is appropriate. Public heckling could be seen as taking a stand, but it's possible that a more supportive approach, like directly confronting the catcallers or supporting the victims, might be better. Alternatively, reporting the catcallers to authorities could be a more constructive method. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the method is causing more harm than good, maybe. But the intention is good. The answer might depend on cultural context and what's considered appropriate intervention. In some places, public shaming is accepted as a form of protest, while others might see it as aggressive. The fact that others are divided in their opinions (some think he's a white knight, others that he's an asshole) suggests there's nuance here. \n\nI need to decide between A (he's in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Considering that catcalling is the root issue, and his method may not be the most effective or respectful solution, but his intent is to stop harassment. However, by making a scene, he might be creating a more hostile environment rather than preventing harassment. Also, the threats he's getting indicate that his approach is causing conflict. On balance, maybe he's not entirely wrong because he's trying to stand against harassment, but the method could be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because his intent is good. If A, then because the method is inappropriate. \n\nHmm. I think the answer leans towards B because the author is trying to do the right thing, albeit in a confrontational way. While his approach has downsides, the core issue is the catcalling, and his intention is to stop it. However, there's a valid argument that he's making things worse. But in the AITA framework, the community often considers intent. So maybe B.\n"
