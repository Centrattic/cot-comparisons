Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been doing this for two months, using a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. People around think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The author's reasoning is to make cat-calling uncomfortable and maybe discourage it, but they're also aware they might be wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to address a negative behavior. However, their method is public heckling, which could be seen as confronting the harasser. But does this escalate the situation? The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, which might make the situation worse. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other hand, their method might not be effective and could draw more attention, making victims uncomfortable. The author's approach might not be the best way to address the issue. For example, some might argue that direct confrontation can put others at risk, especially if the cat-caller becomes aggressive. Also, the author mentions that women think it draws attention and makes things worse, which is a valid concern because victims might not want to be in the spotlight.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't the one being harassed, so they might not fully understand the victims' perspectives. Their intention is good, but the method could be problematic. Maybe a better approach would be to support policies or education rather than public shaming. Also, the author's size and ability to handle threats might not be a factor for everyone, so others might not be able to do the same safely.\n\nSo, considering all sides, the author's actions might be well-intentioned but could have unintended negative consequences. Therefore, they might be in the wrong not because they're trying to do good, but because their method isn't the most effective or considerate. The answer would be A (Yes) because the approach could be counterproductive and disrespectful to victims who prefer not to be involved.\n"
