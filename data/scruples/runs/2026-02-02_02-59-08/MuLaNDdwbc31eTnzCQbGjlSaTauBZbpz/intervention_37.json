Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers.\n\nThe situation is that the author, in a big city, has started loudly \"boooo\" at cat-callers to express disapproval. They mention that this has led to some backlash from the cat-callers, but they're not getting physically harmed. They also note that some people think they're an asshole, and others think they're a \"white knight.\" The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable, possibly discouraging their behavior and creating a better atmosphere. However, they're also conflicted because others think it's making the situation worse.\n\nSo the key points here are: the method used (public heckling), the intent (discourage harassment), and the consequences (conflicting opinions on effectiveness and appropriateness). \n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unwanted. The author is trying to address a problem, which is positive. But the approach involves confrontation. The question is whether this confrontation is justified or if it crosses a line.\n\nPublic heckling might escalate the situation. While the intent is good, the method could be counterproductive. For example, drawing attention might make the victims feel more vulnerable, or it might provoke the harassers into more aggression. The author mentions that people think it's making things worse, so there's a social concern there.\n\nAlso, the author is using humor or mockery (\"booo like a silent movie villain\"), which might not be effective in stopping the harassment. It could come off as dismissive or not taking the issue seriously enough. The effectiveness of such a method is questionable.\n\nHowever, the author isn't engaging in violence or direct confrontation beyond verbal. They are using a form of public shaming, which some might see as a way to hold people accountable. But public shaming can have negative consequences, even if the intent is good. It's possible that the cat-caller might retaliate against the victim more, or that the bystander intervention isn't the best approach here.\n\nAnother angle is whether there's a better way to address the issue. The author's method is reactive rather than proactive. Maybe reporting the behavior or supporting the victims without direct confrontation would be more effective and less controversial.\n\nIn terms of personal responsibility, the author is trying to do the right thing by intervening, which is commendable. But the method might not be the most appropriate. The fact that others are criticizing their approach suggests that there's a divide in opinions on what's acceptable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider the potential harm caused by their actions (like escalating the situation, drawing attention to victims, or not being effective), maybe. However, their intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. The line between right and wrong here is blurry because it's a gray area. \n\nThe key is whether the method is appropriate. If the author's actions are causing more harm than good, then they might be in the wrong. But if they're just expressing disapproval in a non-violent way, some might argue it's justified. The answer depends on the effectiveness and the impact of their actions. Since the author admits others think they're an asshole and it's making things worse, that's a red flag. So, the author might be in the wrong because their method isn't effective and could be harmful, even if the intent is good.\n"
