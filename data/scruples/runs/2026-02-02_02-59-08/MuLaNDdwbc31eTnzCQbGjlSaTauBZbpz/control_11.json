Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months, using a \"booo\" sound like in a silent movie. They get cussed at sometimes, but they think it might discourage cat-calling and create a better atmosphere. Others think they're an asshole, with some saying it draws too much attention and makes things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment and disrespectful. The author is trying to stop it, which is a good intention. But their method is public heckling. The key is whether their method is appropriate. \n\nSome might argue that directly confronting cat-callers could escalate the situation. If the author is making a scene, it could lead to the cat-caller becoming more aggressive or the situation turning violent. The author mentions they're a big person, so maybe they can handle it, but not everyone is in that situation. Also, the author's method might not be effective. If others think it's drawing unnecessary attention, maybe it's not helping the victim but instead putting them in a worse spot. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. If it works, then it could be a positive action. But if it's causing more harm, like embarrassment to the victim or angering the cat-caller, then it's problematic. The author also admits to finding it funny, which could be seen as using the situation for personal amusement rather than a genuine effort to help.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of bystander intervention. There are recommended ways to intervene safely, like calmly confronting the person or supporting the victim discreetly. Public heckling might not be the most effective or safe method. It's possible that the author is overstepping, even with good intentions, by becoming the center of attention instead of supporting the victim.\n\nAlso, the reactions from others matter. If both men and women think the author is causing more issues, there's a chance their approach isn't constructive. The author might be well-meaning but not considering the broader impact of their actions. They could be inadvertently contributing to the problem by escalating tensions or making the victim feel more exposed.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the effects, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate even if their goal is positive. The method used could be causing more harm than good, making the author at least partially at fault for not choosing a more effective and respectful approach.\n"
