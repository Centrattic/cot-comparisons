Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who is heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that they want to discourage cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They've been doing this for two months in a big city, and it's causing some backlash, with people cussing at them and threatening them. The author themselves is a big guy, so no one has physically confronted him yet.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing behavior. The author is trying to address that by publicly shaming the cat-callers. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. But the method they're using is loud heckling, which might escalate the situation. The author acknowledges that others think they're an asshole, both from men and women. Women think it draws attention and makes the situation worse, which is a valid concern because sometimes public confrontations can escalate tension or put the victims in a more uncomfortable position.\n\nThe author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to deter future behavior. While that's a good intention, the method might not be effective. Also, the heckling could be seen as aggressive or confrontational, which might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author is overstepping by inserting themselves into the situation, potentially making things more uncomfortable for the people involved rather than helping. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for de-escalation. Instead of loudly confronting the cat-caller, which might provoke a hostile response, a more effective approach could be to quietly support the person being harassed or to address the behavior in a way that doesn't escalate conflict. Also, the author mentions finding it funny, which might imply that their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic, but also a bit of personal enjoyment, which could be seen as hypocritical given their initial stance.\n\nHowever, the author's intent is to create a better atmosphere where other men might discourage such behavior. That part is a positive goal. But the method might not be the best. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or if they are indeed the asshole (AITA). \n\nIn terms of social norms, public shaming can be controversial. While the goal is good, the method can backfire. Also, the author is a big person and might feel safe doing this, but others might not be in the same situation. It's also possible that the cat-callers aren't aware their behavior is harmful, but that's a stretch given the prevalence of discussions around harassment.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while well-intentioned, might not be the most effective or appropriate way to address the issue. They could be causing more harm than good by drawing attention to the situation and potentially escalating it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their method of intervention isn't constructive and could make things worse for the people involved.\n"
