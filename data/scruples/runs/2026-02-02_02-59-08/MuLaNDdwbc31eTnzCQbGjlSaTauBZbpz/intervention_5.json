Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-calleurs. They started doing this after moving to a big city and they think it's a good way to discourage the behavior by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. Their methods include making loud boos and getting some backlash, but they're not backing down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author's goal is to stop catcalling, which is a negative behavior. Their method is to publicly shame the cat-caller. But does that make it okay? Well, public shaming can be a gray area. On one hand, it's standing up against harassment. On the other, it might escalate the situation or draw unwanted attention.\n\nThe author mentions that other people, both men and women, think they're an asshole. The guys think they're being a \"white knight,\" which might mean they see them as overstepping, while women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. But the author believes it could create a culture where others also call out the behavior. \n\nNow, the key points: Is the method effective? The author hasn't stopped the cat-calling, just made it uncomfortable for the harassers. Public confrontation can sometimes deter future actions, but it might also provoke a defensive reaction. Also, the author is physically capable and hasn't been harmed, but others might not be in that position. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are appropriate in public spaces. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, and intervening is generally seen as positive, but the method of intervention matters. Loud heckling might not be the best approach because it could lead to a confrontation or put the author at risk. However, the author hasn't faced physical harm yet. \n\nSome might argue that the author is taking justice into their own hands, which isn't the role of a bystander. Others might support it as a form of activism. The line between standing up against harassment and becoming a harasser themselves is thin here. Also, the author's own admission of finding it funny complicates things\u2014they might be enjoying the confrontation, which could be seen as hypocritical or insincere.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing movement to address harassment, but the methods vary. Some advocate for direct confrontation, while others prefer reporting or creating awareness. The author's method might not be the most effective, but their intent is to help. However, if it's causing more harm than good (like making the situation worse for the victims or escalating the aggressor's response), then it's problematic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's approach is justified. If their actions are causing more issues than they're solving, they might be in the wrong. But if they're effectively deterring the behavior without causing harm, then maybe not. The fact that others disagree with their method is a point to consider. The author should probably evaluate if there are better ways to address the issue, perhaps through community efforts or education rather than direct confrontation in a way that could escalate tensions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is good, their method might be inconsiderate and potentially counterproductive. They could be seen as in the wrong if their approach is causing more harm than good, even if their intentions are to stop harassment.\n"
