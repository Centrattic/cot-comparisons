Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers by making a \"booo!\" noise at them. The author is in a big city, has been doing this for two months, and gets some negative reactions. The main points are the methods used and whether they cross a line into being an asshole.\n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and unwanted. The author is trying to address this by making it uncomfortable for the cat-caller. Their rationale is to discourage the behavior and create a better environment. But others think they're an asshole because they might be escalating the situation. \n\nThe key here is the method. Using a loud \"booo!\" is a form of public confrontation. The author isn't physically confronting the cat-caller but using a non-physical, mocking sound. Is that acceptable? Some might argue that it's a form of peaceful protest or intervention. Others might say it's adding to the problem by drawing attention, making the situation more confrontational, and potentially putting others at risk.\n\nThe author mentions that the cat-callers respond with cussing and threats, but the author is physically capable and no one has acted on the threats. However, the effect on the environment is in question. If the author's actions are creating a more hostile atmosphere, maybe the cat-caller is just reacting to being mocked. Also, the author's own admission that people of both genders think they're an asshole adds to the consideration. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't physically harming anyone. It's a verbal response to a verbal issue. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If the author's intention is good, but the method is counterproductive or creates more problems (like making women uncomfortable or escalating the situation), then maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if the method is harmless and effective, then it's justified.\n\nAnother angle: public shaming can be a form of bullying. If the author is using mockery to stop the behavior, is that acceptable? Or does it cross a line into becoming the problem? Also, the author's own hypocrisy is mentioned, which might suggest a lack of self-awareness.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions could be seen as a well-intentioned but potentially counterproductive method. Whether they are in the wrong depends on whether their actions are seen as constructive or just adding to the problem. Since the author is not using violence but is causing discomfort, it's a bit of a gray area. However, given that others perceive them as an asshole and the possible unintended consequences, maybe the answer is that they are in the wrong.\n"
