Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author moved to a big city and started loudly \"booing\" cat-callers to make it uncomfortable for them and discourage the behavior. They get some backlash but haven't faced physical consequences. People around think they're an asshole, with some believing it could lead to trouble and others feeling it makes the situation worse. The author's reasoning is to change the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers and maybe encourage others to speak up. They also admit it's partly for their own amusement.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author's method involves public confrontation. On one hand, they're trying to address a problem, which is commendable. But on the other hand, loud heckling could escalate the situation. Even though the author is physically imposing, the threats suggest that their approach might provoke aggression. \n\nThe author's intention is to discourage the behavior, but does their method do more harm? If their actions lead to a more confrontational environment, maybe even putting themselves or others at risk, that could be problematic. Also, by drawing attention, they might make the victim feel more self-conscious or embarrassed. However, if their actions stop the cat-caller, it might be beneficial. \n\nIt's a tricky balance. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether their actions are justifiable as a form of intervention. Some might argue it's standing up against harassment, others might say it's not their place and could escalate things. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But if the author's method is effective without causing harm, then maybe not in the wrong. But if it's causing more issues, then they might be. The fact that others are calling them an asshole suggests some public disapproval. However, the author isn't physically attacking, just verbally confronting. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the effectiveness and the context. Since the user wants a definitive A or B, I need to weigh the pros and cons. The author is trying to address a valid issue, but their method could be counterproductive. But the alternative is passive, which might not help. \n\nIn many cases, public shaming or confrontation can be seen as a form of intervention. However, if it risks escalating to violence, maybe the approach is flawed. But the author hasn't faced actual harm yet. So, is it their fault? Maybe not, since they're trying to create a better environment. But the potential for harm exists. \n\nI think it's a gray area, but the author isn't in the wrong because their intention is to stop harassment, even if the method is debatable. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
