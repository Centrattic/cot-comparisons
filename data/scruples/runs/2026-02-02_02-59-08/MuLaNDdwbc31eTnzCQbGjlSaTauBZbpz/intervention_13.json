Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The person says they started doing this two months after moving to a big city, motivated by a pet peeve about cat-calling. Their method is to \"booo!\" like in a silent movie to mock the cat-callers, which sometimes leads to threats but no actual harm. They mention that others think they're an asshole, with some seeing them as a naive white knight and others as making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable, discourage the behavior, and create a norm where others tell the cat-caller to stop. They also admit they find it funny, but are unsure if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the morality of their actions. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing, so the intent to stop it is good. However, the method of loud heckling could be seen as confrontational. The key here is whether the means are appropriate. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem. Public shaming in this way might be seen as a form of intervention. Some might argue that it's a way to hold the cat-caller accountable in the moment, especially if the person is in a position to do so safely. The author mentions they are a \"big fucker\" and no one has physically confronted them yet, so maybe they feel confident in this approach.\n\nOn the other hand, loud heckling could escalate the situation. The cat-caller might become more aggressive, and the author's actions might put themselves or others at risk. The fact that others, especially women, think it draws attention and makes the situation worse is a concern. Also, the author's admission that they find it funny suggests a possible lack of seriousness about the issue, which could trivialize the harassment. \n\nAnother angle is bystander intervention. Effective bystander techniques often recommend direct but non-confrontational approaches, like calmly telling the cat-caller to stop, or supporting the person being harassed. Loud heckling isn't a standard recommended method. It could be counterproductive if it makes the victim feel more targeted or if it turns the situation into a spectacle. \n\nThe author's justification that it might create an atmosphere where others tell the cat-caller to stop is plausible, but the effectiveness of such a public shaming tactic is debatable. There's also the issue of personal responsibility. While the intent is good, the method might not be the best approach. The threats received indicate that the cat-callers are not taking it well, and even though no one has followed through, there's a risk involved.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a matter of whether the author's actions cross the line from intervention into provocation. If the goal is to stop harassment, but the method could potentially escalate it, then the author could be in the wrong for using an ineffective or harmful method. However, if the intent is positive and the author is not engaging in violence or threats themselves, then some might argue they're not in the wrong, just using a questionable method.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a form of activism, but it's possible they're not the most effective or safe way to address the issue. The key point is whether their method is causing more harm than good. Since they are not directly harming the cat-caller (just mocking them), but might be escalating the situation, it's a gray area. However, the fact that others, including those who understand the issue, think they are being an asshole suggests that there's a valid criticism here. The author might be overestimating the effectiveness of their approach and underestimating the potential negative consequences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, even if their intent is good.\n"
