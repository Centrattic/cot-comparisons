Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author says they started doing this after moving to a big city and their main argument is that they want to discourage the behavior by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. They also mention that people think they're an asshole, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" and others saying they're drawing attention and making it worse. The author's rationale is that they want to create an environment where other men tell each other to stop.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. However, the method they use is loud heckling, which could potentially escalate the situation. The author does get cussing and threats in return but claims they're big and no one has acted on it. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to stop a negative behavior, which is commendable. On the other hand, their method might be seen as confrontational and could lead to conflict. The fact that both men and women think they're being an asshole suggests that their approach isn't effective or acceptable to others. The women's perspective is particularly important here, as they are the ones most affected by cat-calling. If the author's actions are making the situation worse by drawing more attention or making the victims uncomfortable, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is using their size as a form of intimidation. Even if they don't mean to, their presence might be seen as aggressive. Also, the humor they derive from the situation might not align with the seriousness of the issue. While the intent is good, the method might not be the best approach. There are other ways to address cat-calling without creating a confrontational environment, such as educating others or supporting policies that address harassment.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author's intention is to stop harassment, their method of loud heckling could be counterproductive and potentially harmful. It's possible they are in the wrong because their approach isn't effective and might make the situation worse, despite good intentions.\n"
