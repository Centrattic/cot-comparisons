Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The writer says they've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior. But people around them think they're being an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unpleasant for those targeted. The author's intention is to stop this behavior, which is a good cause. However, their method of loudly \"booo\"-ing might be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this method is appropriate or if it escalates the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem. They see cat-calling as wrong and want to intervene. Their approach could be seen as a form of direct action, similar to public shaming. But public shaming can have negative consequences. For example, the cat-caller might become more aggressive, or the situation could turn violent. The author mentions that they get cursed at and threatened, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not the one being harassed. The victims might prefer not to have their harassment drawn attention to, as it could make them feel worse. The author's heckling might inadvertently make the situation more uncomfortable for the target rather than the cat-caller. Also, the effectiveness of this method is questionable. Simply making noise might not deter the behavior, and it could be seen as the author taking over the problem-solving in a way that's not constructive.\n\nAnother point is that the author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but that doesn't mean it's safe or right. Relying on personal strength isn't a sustainable solution. The author's approach might not be the best way to address systemic issues like harassment. There could be more effective methods, such as reporting incidents, supporting policies against harassment, or educating others in a non-confrontational way.\n\nThe author's own admission that they find it funny complicates things. If part of their motivation is personal amusement, that could be seen as insensitivity towards the seriousness of harassment. However, their main argument is about discouraging the behavior, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of social norms, publicly shaming others, even for a good cause, can be polarizing. While some might support it as a form of standing up against harassment, others might see it as escalating the conflict and not addressing the root issues. The opinions of those around them\u2014both men and women\u2014are split, which indicates that there's no clear consensus.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the intent is good (stopping harassment), but the method might be counterproductive or harmful. The author's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're not the direct victim. The effectiveness and potential for causing more harm (like increasing the victim's discomfort or provoking violence) are concerns. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, but perhaps in a way that shows good intentions. They might need to consider alternative, more supportive methods.\n"
