Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their method is making a loud \"booo!\" sound like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to curses or threats from the cat-callers. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage their behavior and create an atmosphere where others might intervene. However, people's reactions are mixed\u2014some think the author is a white knight, others, especially women, think it's making things worse. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing, so the author is trying to address a problem. But the method they're using\u2014publicly shaming the cat-callers with a loud \"booo\"\u2014might be seen as confrontational. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't engaging in physical confrontation, which could escalate the situation. They're using a non-violent method to express disapproval. Public shaming can be a form of social pressure, which some argue can be effective in changing behavior. The author's intention is to create an environment where such behavior is discouraged, which is a positive goal.\n\nOn the other hand, public shaming can also have negative side effects. It might escalate tensions, as evidenced by the threats the author receives. Moreover, some people, especially women, think it draws more attention to the situation and could potentially make victims feel more uncomfortable. If the cat-caller is made to feel targeted, they might react aggressively, which could endanger the victims. The author mentions they're a \"fairly big\" person, so maybe they feel safe, but others might not, and the situation could become more volatile.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of bystander intervention. Encouraging others to tell cat-callers to stop is good, but the method of intervention matters. A loud \"booo\" might not be effective in stopping the behavior on the spot and might not model the most constructive form of intervention. Some might argue that a more direct and calm approach, like telling the cat-caller to stop, could be more effective and less confrontational.\n\nAlso, the author's own admission that they find it funny complicates things. If the motivation isn't purely to help but also for personal amusement, that could be seen as insincere or even mocking, especially if the victims aren't comfortable with that method.\n\nConsidering all these points, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the key is whether the method is appropriate. While the intent is good, the approach might not be the most effective or safe. Public shaming can backfire, and the potential for escalation is a concern. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to address harassment, but their method could be problematic. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If \"in the wrong\" means they should stop, then maybe yes. If it's about moral wrongdoing, maybe not. But given the possible negative consequences and alternative methods, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
