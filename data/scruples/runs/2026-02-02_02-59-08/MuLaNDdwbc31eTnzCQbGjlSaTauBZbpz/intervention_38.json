Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author moved to a big city and has been loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers for two months. They do this to make the cat-callers uncomfortable, hoping to discourage the behavior and create an environment where others also speak up. However, people around them think the author is an asshole. Men think they're a \"white knight\" likely to get hurt, and women believe they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author acknowledges they might be wrong but is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what cat-calling is. It's a form of harassment, usually involving unwanted attention from men towards women or others, often in public spaces. The intent is to make the victim feel uncomfortable or objectified. Now, the author is trying to counter this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But the question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is noble: to stop harassment. Publicly confronting the cat-caller might discourage them. However, the method involves loud heckling, which can escalate the situation. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, which could make the situation more confrontational. Also, women's reactions are that it draws attention and makes things worse. This could be because in some cases, drawing a crowd or making a scene might intimidate the victim further, or the cat-caller might become more aggressive if challenged in front of others.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but this doesn't mean it's safe. If someone is threatened, even if they don't follow through, it's a red flag. Also, the author's approach might not be inclusive. Some people might not want public confrontation and could feel the author is overstepping. The author's method could be seen as taking the victim's place in addressing the harassment, which might not always be wanted.\n\nThe author's justification is based on creating an atmosphere where others also speak up. But is loud heckling the right way? Maybe alternative methods, like directly confronting the cat-caller in a calm manner, or supporting the victim without drawing attention, could be more effective. Also, the author admits they find it funny, which might trivialize a serious issue.\n\nLegally, in many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment and can be reported. The author's actions might not be illegal, but socially, there's a debate. The main issue is whether their method is effective and respectful, or if it's causing more harm by escalating tensions or not addressing the root issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to stop harassment, the method might be counterproductive. Public heckling could escalate the situation, potentially putting themselves and others at risk, and might not be wanted by the victims. Alternatives like supporting the victim discreetly or reporting the incident might be better. So, the author might be in the wrong because their approach, despite good intentions, could be harmful.\n"
