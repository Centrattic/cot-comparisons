Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author explains that they've been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their motivation is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable, potentially discouraging the behavior and creating an atmosphere where others might also tell the cat-callers off. However, they've received criticism from both men and women, with some thinking they're a \"white knight\" and others believe they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author is conflicted and seeks validation or reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether their actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author is intervening to stop this harassment, which is a positive intent. But the method they're using is loud heckling, which can be seen as aggressive or confrontational. The question is whether this method crosses a line into being problematic themselves.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong (Answer A): \n1. Their approach might escalate the situation, potentially making it more confrontational. While the cat-caller is at fault, the author's loud response could be seen as giving the cat-caller the attention they crave, which might inadvertently encourage further harassment. \n2. Some people (especially women) think it draws unnecessary attention, making the situation worse. If the goal is to stop harassment, creating a scene could lead to the victim feeling more targeted or embarrassed.\n3. The author mentions that others see them as an asshole, which suggests that their method isn't universally accepted. Even with good intentions, if the method is causing more harm or discomfort than good, it's worth reconsidering.\n\nArguments against the author being in the wrong (Answer B):\n1. The author is taking a stand against harassment, which is a positive action. Their intent is to deter future harassment by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, which aligns with the idea of creating a safer environment.\n2. The cat-caller is the initial aggressor. The author's response is a form of public shaming, which some might argue is a justified reaction to harassment.\n3. The author isn't physically confronting the cat-caller but using verbal disapproval, which is a non-violent method of intervention.\n\nAnother angle: The effectiveness of public shaming. While it might deter some, it could also lead to the cat-caller becoming more aggressive. The author isn't physically harming anyone, but the heckling could be seen as a form of harassment or retaliation. However, the original issue is the cat-caller's behavior, which is unethical. The author's response, while perhaps unorthodox, is in response to a harmful action.\n\nAlso, considering the author's size and the fact that no one has physically confronted them yet might imply that the response hasn't led to violence. But the question isn't about whether it's effective, but whether it's morally wrong. The author's intention is to stop harassment, which is a noble goal. However, the method might not be the best approach. It's possible to argue that the author is overstepping by making a scene, thus potentially causing more issues for the victims.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might not be the most effective or appropriate. The author's actions could be seen as creating a new problem (public confrontation) rather than solving the initial issue. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for their approach, even if the motivation is right.\n"
