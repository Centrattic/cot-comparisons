Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They provided the context from the AITA question.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is trying to stop cat-calling by publicly shaming the cat-callers with a \"booo!\" like in a movie. They mention that this has led to some negative reactions but they haven't been physically attacked yet. The question is whether this action is justified or if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, cat-calling is generally considered harassment and disrespectful. The author's intention is to discourage the behavior, which seems positive. But their method is public shaming and heckling, which might escalate the situation. The responses from others are mixed: some see them as a white knight, others as causing more attention. The author also admits to finding it funny, which might be a bit hypocritical given their stance against cat-calling.\n\nPossible points to consider: Is public shaming an effective or appropriate way to address harassment? Could it make the situation worse by drawing more attention or provoking the harasser? Are there better ways to intervene, like reporting or directly telling the harasser to stop? Also, the author's own admission of hypocrisy (their pet peeve but their action might mirror the issue) is a point against them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to stand up against harassment, which is a positive intent. They might be trying to create a culture where such behavior is not tolerated. However, their method might not be the best approach. The fact that others think they're drawing more attention and making it worse suggests that their approach could be counterproductive.\n\nLegal aspects? Depending on the jurisdiction, public shaming might not be illegal unless it's deemed harassment itself. But the question is more about moral wrongdoing rather than legal.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to use public humiliation to stop harassment? Some might argue that it's a form of justice, others that it's not their place to judge or humiliate others. The author's approach could be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which can have unintended consequences.\n\nThe author's method could potentially escalate the situation, leading to confrontations. Even if they are physically capable, it's risky. Also, the fact that they're getting threats shows that their approach is causing conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because their method, while well-intentioned, could be exacerbating the problem rather than solving it. There are more constructive ways to address harassment without resorting to public shaming. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
