Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been loudly booing cat-callers for two months in a big city. They mention that people around them have negative reactions: some get angry or threaten them, but the author isn't being physically attacked yet. The author's rationale is that they want to make cat-calling uncomfortable and maybe discourage it, but others think they're an asshole or making things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and can make people uncomfortable, especially towards women. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But is that acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against unwanted behavior, which could be seen as a positive. They want to create a better environment by discouraging harassment. However, the method involves confrontation, which might escalate the situation. The author mentions getting cussed at and threats, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does publicly shaming someone actually stop the behavior, or does it just create a hostile situation? Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might imply they're doing it for personal reasons rather than purely altruistic ones.\n\nSocially, what's acceptable? Some might argue that using public shaming is a valid form of protest, while others think it's not the person's place to intervene. The author's size might make them feel safe, but others might see it as someone using their physical presence to dominate the situation.\n\nAlso, the author is drawing attention to the situation. The women think it's making things worse by creating more attention. If the cat-caller is being booed, the victim might feel even more uncomfortable now with a confrontation happening. It could lead to embarrassment for the cat-caller in public, which isn't ideal either.\n\nLegal aspects? Probably not a factor here unless the heckling becomes a disturbance, but the question is about being in the wrong ethically or socially, not legally.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions are good, but their method might be counterproductive. The question is whether their actions cross a line. If their goal is to stop harassment, but their method causes more issues, maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if they're just expressing their disapproval without harming others, perhaps not. But since they're causing conflict, maybe they are.\n\nThe answer might depend on cultural context. In some places, public shaming is seen as acceptable protest; in others, it's considered rude. The author is in a big city, which might have more tolerance for such actions, but the responses from others suggest otherwise.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to address a problem but using a method that's divisive and potentially harmful. They might be overstepping by taking on the role of a moral enforcer in a public space. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
