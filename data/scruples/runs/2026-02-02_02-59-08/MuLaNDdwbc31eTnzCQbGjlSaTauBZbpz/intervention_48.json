Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author moved to a big city and started loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers to make them uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. People around them, both men and women, have mixed reactions. Men think they might be inviting trouble, women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might reduce the behavior and encourage others to stop. But they're unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of cat-calling itself. It's generally considered harassment and is unwanted. The author is trying to address this by confronting the cat-callers. But the method is public heckling with a \"booo\" like a silent movie villain. That's a form of public shaming. Public shaming can be seen as a form of confrontation, but it's also a way to use social pressure to change behavior. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legal aspects might not be the main issue here unless it escalates to physical confrontation, which hasn't happened yet. The author mentions getting cursed at but no actual assault. So legally, maybe they're not doing anything illegal. But ethics and social norms?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to combat harassment, which is a good intention. On the other hand, their method might be seen as counterproductive. When they \"booo\", they could be making the victim feel more embarrassed or drawing more attention to the situation. The women's perspective here is that it's making things worse. If the cat-caller is being loudly mocked, maybe they'll stop, but the victim might feel more discomfort. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they find it funny. That might be part of the problem. If the motivation is partially for amusement, that could be seen as insensitivity. Even if the outcome is good, the intent matters. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author is overstepping. Intervening in a harassment situation can be tricky. Sometimes it's better to report or support the victim rather than confront the harasser directly, especially if it could escalate. The author is a bystander, and their approach could have unintended consequences. For example, the cat-caller might get angry and target the victim more, or the author could become a target themselves. \n\nBut the author is also a big person and hasn't faced physical retaliation yet. They might feel empowered to take a stand. However, public shaming might not be the most effective method. Studies or social experiments might show that public shaming can work, but it can also backfire. It's a debate.\n\nThe author is seeking validation for their actions. They're aware they might be seen as an asshole but think they're helping. The key points are their intent to stop harassment versus the method's effectiveness and potential harm. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the method is causing more harm than good, like making the victim uncomfortable or not actually stopping the behavior, then the author might be in the wrong. But if it's working, and the cat-callers are being deterred, then maybe they're justified. However, the author's approach might not address the root issue and could lead to confrontations that are more harmful.\n\nI think the answer here hinges on whether the method is effective and respectful. The author's approach is confrontational and could be seen as aggressive, even if their intent is good. The women's feedback that it makes things worse is important. If the victim feels more embarrassed or unsafe because someone else is drawing attention, that's a problem. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because their method is causing unintended harm even if their intent is good. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
