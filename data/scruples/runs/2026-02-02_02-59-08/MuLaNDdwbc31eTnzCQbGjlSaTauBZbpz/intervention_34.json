Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author justifies it by saying they want to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere, but others think they're an asshole. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to confront it directly by making a public show of disapproval. On one hand, they're trying to support the person being harassed by showing solidarity. But on the other hand, their approach might be escalating the situation. \n\nThe author mentions that their heckling leads to cussing and threats but no actual violence. They are confident in their physical size, but that doesn't mean the situation is safe. Public confrontations can sometimes make things worse, as the cat-caller might get defensive and escalate their behavior. Also, the author's method draws attention, which the people being harassed might not want. \n\nThe user's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable could discourage future behavior. However, confrontation can sometimes lead to more aggression. The author also admits to finding it funny, which might indicate they're not taking the harassment seriously enough. The people targeted by the harassment might feel like the situation is now a spectacle, which isn't helpful. \n\nAnother angle is that by publicly shaming the cat-caller, the author might be adding to the problem rather than solving it. It's possible that the right approach would be to support the person being harassed discreetly, like through a non-confrontational intervention or reporting the behavior. \n\nBut then, there's the argument that public shaming can act as a deterrent. However, the effectiveness of that is debatable. The key point is whether the author's actions are causing more harm than good. If the cat-caller is being publicly humiliated, it might not address the root issue and could lead to retaliation. \n\nAlso, considering the reactions of others, both men and women, they don't think the author is right. That's a red flag. If the majority perception is that it's unhelpful, maybe the author should reconsider their approach. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is good, the method might be counterproductive. Public heckling could escalate the situation and potentially make things worse for the person being harassed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using a confrontational approach that could lead to more harm.\n"
