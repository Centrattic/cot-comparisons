Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-collars. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully. The author is in a big city and has started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers for two months. Their reasoning is that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they might discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others also tell off the cat-callers. They mention getting curses and threats in return but haven't faced physical harm yet. People around them, both men and women, have different opinions: men think they're being a \"white knight\" (which might mean they're overstepping) and women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author acknowledges they might be an asshole and asks if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment and is unacceptable. The author is trying to address it, which is a good intention. But their method is to mock the cat-caller loudly. The question is whether this method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, supporting the victim and stopping harassment is right. But the author's approach might be escalating the situation. The boos could be seen as confrontational. The author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't been physically harmed, but maybe their approach could lead to more conflict. The women's perspective that it's drawing attention and making it worse might be valid if the cat-caller then focuses more on the heckler instead of the victim. Also, the author is doing this for their own enjoyment, which might not be the best motive. Hypocrisy is mentioned\u2014they have a pet peeve but are acting in a way others see as problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to stand up against harassment. If their method is effective in deterring the behavior, even if it's not perfect, maybe it's justified. However, the effectiveness isn't clear. The threats and curses they receive suggest that it's not resolving the issue peacefully.\n\nI need to weigh intentions vs. consequences. The intent is good, but the method might be counterproductive. The author is inserting themselves into a situation where they might not be the best person to handle it. Women might prefer not to have a third party escalate the situation, as it could put them in more danger. It's possible that the author is overstepping by taking on a \"white knight\" role, which can be problematic because it's not the victim's responsibility to be protected by others in this way.\n\nAlso, the author's admission that they find it funny is a red flag. If part of their motivation is personal amusement, that's not a good reason to act. They should focus on helping the victim rather than their own satisfaction.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that public shaming of harassers can be a form of intervention. But it's a contentious method. There's also the aspect of de-escalation. Loudly heckling might not de-escalate but instead provoke more aggression. The fact that others around them consider them an asshole suggests that the approach is not socially accepted, even if the intent is good.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author's method might be counterproductive and could cause more harm than good. Even though the intention is to stop harassment, the means might be inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
