Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, the author's intent is to discourage harassment by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers. They mention being loud, like \"booo!\" which is similar to mocking. They've faced some backlash, including threats, but no physical harm yet.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether their actions cross a line. Cat-calling is definitely wrong, but responding with public shaming or heckling could have mixed effects. On one hand, it might deter the harasser. On the other, it could escalate the situation, making the victim uncomfortable or drawing more attention. The author notes that others think they're an asshole, with both men and women disagreeing with their approach. Women think it makes things worse, perhaps by adding to the harassment or not addressing the root issue.\n\nThe author's rationale is to create a deterrent effect, but is this a valid approach? Public confrontation can sometimes lead to more conflict. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might indicate a lack of empathy or a focus on personal amusement rather than the victim's safety.\n\nConsidering ethical angles: Is it right to use public shaming as a form of social justice? While the intent is good, the method might not be. The author could be infringing on the cat-caller's rights, even if those actions are offensive. However, cat-calling itself is a violation of others' space and dignity. There's a balance between free speech and preventing harassment.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, cat-calling is not a criminal act but is considered harassment. The author's heckling might be protected speech, but if it leads to threats or physical altercations, there could be consequences. So legally, maybe not in the wrong, but socially?\n\nSocially, the community's reaction is negative. The author might be seen as taking justice into their own hands, which can be problematic. It's possible that formal channels (like reporting to authorities) are more effective than personal intervention.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to stop harassment, their method might not be the most effective or appropriate. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the approach could escalate issues and isn't universally supported. However, there's a counter-argument for B (not in the wrong) as they're addressing harassment. But given the potential for harm and the community's negative feedback, A seems more likely.\n"
