Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has been doing this for two months in a big city. Their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, maybe even create a culture where others tell the cat-caller off. They also admit they find it funny. People around them think they're an asshole, with both men and women disagreeing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is wrong. The author is trying to address this, which is a positive intent. However, the method is loud heckling, which could escalate the situation. The author mentions getting threats in return but says no one has followed through. \n\nNow, is the method appropriate? Public confrontation can be a form of intervention. However, the key here is whether the author's actions are justified. By loudly \"boooing\" the cat-caller, they might be drawing attention, which could make the victim (the person being cat-called) more uncomfortable. The author acknowledges that women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. So, maybe the approach isn't effective in helping the victim and could even be harmful.\n\nAlso, the author's admission that they find it funny complicates things. While the intent might be to discourage harassment, the enjoyment aspect might suggest a lack of sensitivity. Cat-calling isn't a joke for the victim, and using humor in response could trivialize the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a problem. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might not be the best way to handle the situation. It's possible that direct confrontation could lead to more conflict. The fact that others think they're an asshole and that their method isn't universally seen as helpful might indicate that they are, in fact, in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that standing up against harassment is justified. But the method here might not be the most effective or respectful. The author is inserting themselves into a situation that's not theirs to correct, potentially making it worse for the person being harassed. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because their method isn't effective and could be counterproductive, even if the intent is good.\n"
