Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The author's main argument is that they're trying to discourage cat-calling by making the perpetrators uncomfortable. They mention getting threats but not being physically harmed yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of confrontation. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harmful, so the author's intention to stop it is understandable. However, the method here is to loudly mock the cat-caller with a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie. This is a public confrontation. \n\nThe author's friends and others think they're being an asshole. Some argue that it could escalate the situation, making it worse. The author acknowledges that they might be drawing attention, which could either deter the cat-caller or make the victim feel more targeted. \n\nAnother angle is the use of humor. The author finds it funny, but using mockery might not be the best approach. It's possible that the cat-caller isn't even aware they're doing something wrong, especially if they come from a culture where it's normalized. In that case, the heckling might not help and could make the person defensive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions being a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they can handle threats physically. However, the main issue is whether their actions are justified. Even if their intent is good, the method might be counterproductive. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If the heckling leads to a hostile environment, maybe the author is inadvertently contributing to the problem by creating more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, creating a culture where people call out bad behavior can be positive. But doing it in a way that's seen as humorous might not be taken seriously. The author should consider alternative methods, like addressing the behavior calmly or supporting the person being harassed without making it a spectacle.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might be flawed. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but the approach could be counterproductive. However, given that the question is whether they're in the wrong for the action itself, the answer hinges on whether the method is appropriate. Since the author's actions could escalate situations and aren't universally supported, it's possible they are in the wrong despite good intentions.\n"
