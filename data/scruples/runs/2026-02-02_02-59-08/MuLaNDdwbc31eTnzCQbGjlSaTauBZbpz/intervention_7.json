Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author says they do this by making a loud \"booo!\" sound, like at a villain in a silent movie. The responses from others are mixed: guys think he's a white knight but might be asking for trouble, while girls think he's making it worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nHmm. So first, cat-calling is generally considered harassing behavior, right? So the author is trying to stop something that's already inappropriate. But their method is public shaming or mocking, which might have unintended consequences. The author says they're making it uncomfortable for the cat-caller, which could deter them. But the girls think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. Maybe the cat-caller gets more attention when someone heckles them, which could escalate things.\n\nAlso, the author is getting some hostile reactions from the cat-callers, like cussing and threats. But they mention they're a \"fairly big fucker\" and no one has acted on the threats yet. However, relying on physical intimidation as a defense isn't a good strategy in the long run.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're trying to stand up against harassment, which is commendable. On the other hand, their method might not be the best approach. Public shaming could lead to confrontations. Also, maybe the author is overstepping by inserting themselves into someone else's problem. The person being cat-called might prefer not to have a scene made, even if it's to stop the harassment.\n\nSo the author's intention is good, but the method might be flawed. The key here is whether their actions are causing more harm than good. If the cat-caller is more likely to stop because of the public shaming, maybe it's justified. But if it's causing the situation to escalate or embarrass the person being cat-called, then maybe not. The girls' perspective is that it's making it worse, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't committing a crime, but their approach could be seen as inappropriate. Maybe there's a better way to address the issue without creating a spectacle. So, while the author's intention is to do good, their method might be problematic. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not considering the potential negative consequences of their approach.\n"
