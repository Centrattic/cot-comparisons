Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The author is asking if they're at fault for loudly heckling cat-callers. They do this in a big city, using a \"booo\" like a silent movie villain. Their reasoning is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. They mention getting cussed at and threats, but no one has physically attacked them. People around think they're an asshole for it, with men thinking they're inviting trouble and women thinking they're making it worse.\n\nHmm, so the main points are: the author is trying to stand up against catcalling, but their method is loud and public. The key question is whether their actions are justified or if they're overstepping.\n\nFirst, catcalling is a form of harassment, so the author's intention is to stop something negative. That's a good start. But how they're doing it is with loud heckling. Now, is this a reasonable response? Well, maybe. If someone is being harassed, intervening can be a good thing. But the method here is public shaming. The author is drawing attention to the cat-callers by making a loud \"booo\" sound. \n\nBut then the author is getting into a conflict situation. The cat-callers are responding with curses and threats. The author is confident they can take care of themselves, but there's a risk of escalating the situation. Also, the author is aware that others think they're an asshole. Women think they're making it worse by drawing attention. Is that true? If a woman is being cat-called, adding a loud \"booo\" might make her feel more targeted, or maybe it could deter the cat-caller. It's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nAnother angle: public confrontation can sometimes escalate situations. Even if the author's intention is good, their method could lead to a more confrontational scenario. For example, if the cat-caller is threatened, they might react more aggressively. The author is putting themselves in a position where they might become a target, but they're physically capable. However, the author is also possibly distracting from the person being harassed. The person being cat-called might not want the situation to escalate with someone else getting involved. \n\nAlso, societal norms: is it acceptable to publicly shame someone who's behaving poorly? In some contexts, yes, but it's a gray area. The author's approach is humorous (like a silent movie villain), which might not be taken seriously by the cat-caller. Or it could be a form of non-violent resistance. But if the goal is to create an atmosphere where others tell off the cat-caller, maybe the author's method isn't effective. It's possible that the author's actions are more about personal satisfaction than helping the person being harassed.\n\nThe author acknowledges that they find it funny, which might suggest that part of their motivation isn't purely altruistic. That could be a red flag. If they're doing it for their own enjoyment, even if it has a positive effect, it's a bit self-serving. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's intention is good (stopping harassment), but their method could be problematic. It might escalate the situation, not help the victim, and could be seen as disruptive. The fact that others, especially women, think it's making things worse is a point to consider. Women are the ones typically targeted by catcalling, so their perspective is crucial here.\n\nTherefore, even if the author's heart is in the right place, their approach might not be the best. It's possible they're in the wrong because their method is causing more harm than good, even if not intentionally.\n"
