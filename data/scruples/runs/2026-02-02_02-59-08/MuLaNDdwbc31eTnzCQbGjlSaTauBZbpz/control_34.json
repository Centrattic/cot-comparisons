Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has a habit of boos at cat-callers, trying to be a positive change. They mention that others think they're an asshole, with both men and women giving different perspectives. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and potentially discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny. They're unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and unwanted. The author is directly confronting it by public shaming. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI should consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so intervening could be seen as standing against harassment. However, the method of intervention\u2014publicly shaming with loud \"boos\"\u2014might be problematic. Is that escalation necessary? Does it create a hostile environment for the cat-caller, but maybe also draw attention to the situation? The author mentions that women think it makes the situation worse by drawing attention. Also, the author is using this method because they think it's effective in making the cat-caller uncomfortable. But is it the right way?\n\nAnother angle: the right to free speech. Can someone yell at someone else for cat-calling? Or does that cross into vigilantism? Also, the author is getting threats, but they don't back down because they're physically bigger. Is there a risk of encouraging a cycle of aggression?\n\nBut then again, the alternative is doing nothing. The author believes in taking action to stop harassment. So maybe they are justified. However, the method might not be the best approach. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment.\n\nIn some cultures, public shaming is a way to address bad behavior, but in others, it might be seen as adding to the problem. The author's intention is good\u2014to stop harassment\u2014but the method could be counterproductive. The women's perspective is that it draws attention and makes the situation worse. If the goal is to help the victim, maybe a better approach is to support them without confronting the harasser directly, especially if it leads to more conflict.\n\nAlso, the author admits to finding it funny, which might indicate that their motives aren't entirely altruistic. Mixing humor with a serious issue could be seen as trivializing it. However, the main issue is the cat-calling itself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're trying to do good by stopping harassment. On the other hand, their method could be harmful or ineffective. The answer might depend on whether the method is considered appropriate. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if their actions are causing more harm (like escalating tensions or drawing attention), then maybe they are in the wrong. But if their intent is good and the method is a form of peaceful protest, then not. But public shaming can be seen as a form of harassment too. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because their approach might not be the best and could be causing more issues than good. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they're trying to address a problem.\n"
