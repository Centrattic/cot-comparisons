Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is trying to stop the harassment by loudly making fun of the cat-callers, which has led to some backlash but also some support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing behavior. The author's intention is to discourage it by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. But is their method appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem they find offensive. Their approach is direct and confrontational. However, by drawing attention to the situation, they might be escalating it. The women mentioned in the post think it's making the situation worse by drawing more attention to the harassment, which could be true if the cat-caller feels more emboldened or if the victim now has to deal with both the original harassment and the heckling.\n\nAlso, the author's method uses public shaming, which can be a form of harassment itself. While the cat-calling is wrong, responding with similar tactics might not be the best approach. The author's size and confidence might protect them from physical retaliation, but others might not be as safe. This could be seen as taking justice into their own hands, which might not be effective or just.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to create a culture where such behavior is discouraged. If their actions lead to others speaking up, maybe that's a positive. But is it their role to act as a vigilante? The question is whether their method is appropriate even if the intent is good.\n\nI think the key points are the effectiveness and the method. Publicly shaming someone can be counterproductive and might not address the root issue. The author's approach could be seen as escalating the situation rather than de-escalating it. Even if the intention is good, the method could be harmful. So the author might be in the wrong because their approach, while well-meaning, uses a confrontational and potentially harmful method that doesn't address the underlying issue effectively.\n"
