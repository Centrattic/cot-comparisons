Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that when the author sees cat-calling, they respond with a loud \"booo\" like a silent movie villain. They get some angry responses from the cat-callers but haven't been physically harmed yet. The author's rationale is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe deter the behavior. However, others think this is making things worse, both from men and women. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and often makes people feel unsafe. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. However, the method used is loud and confrontational. While the intent is good, the means could be problematic. \n\nPublic shaming can sometimes escalate tensions. If someone is being cat-called, the immediate reaction might be to confront the person, but doing so in a public and loud manner might draw more attention to the situation, potentially making the victim feel more targeted. The author mentions that both men and women think they're an asshole, which suggests that there's a perception of causing more harm than good. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. The author's method relies on making the cat-caller uncomfortable. But does this actually stop the behavior? If the cat-caller is angry, maybe they become more aggressive. Also, the author is a \"fairly big fucker,\" so they might not be in danger, but others might not be in such a position. \n\nThere's also the aspect of drawing attention. If the author's \"booo\" makes others look, it could either help by showing solidarity or make the situation worse by creating a scene. Women might feel that their discomfort is now compounded by the author's actions, which don't address the root issue but instead add another layer of conflict.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, creating an atmosphere where people discourage cat-calling is a good goal. However, the method here might not be the best way to achieve that. Encouraging others to intervene in a constructive manner, rather than through loud heckling, might be more effective and safer. \n\nThe author's admission that they find it funny is a red flag. If the primary motivation includes personal amusement, it might undermine the seriousness of the issue for the victims. It's possible the author isn't fully considering the victims' experiences and instead is using this as a way to feel empowered themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is to stop cat-calling, the method used here\u2014publicly shaming the cat-caller in a confrontational way\u2014could be seen as exacerbating the problem. The author's actions might not be the most effective or considerate way to address the issue, making them at least partially responsible for the negative outcomes perceived by others. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
