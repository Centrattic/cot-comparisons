Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about loudly heckling cat-callers. The person is doing this for two months in a big city. They use a \"booo!\" sound like a silent movie villain, get some cussing and threats, but no actual fights. People around think they're an asshole, with different opinions from guys and girls.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Catcalling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is trying to address this by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. Their rationale is to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. However, others think they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They are actively trying to stop harassment, which is a positive intent. But their method involves public heckling, which might escalate the situation. The author gets threats but hasn't faced physical consequences. The girls' perspective is that it draws attention, possibly making the victims uncomfortable too. Maybe the heckling doesn't help the victims and could be seen as confrontational. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not directly confronting the victims but the perpetrators. The question is whether their approach is effective or appropriate. Some might argue that direct intervention could be helpful, while others think it's not the best way. The author also admits they find it funny, which could be seen as insensitivity.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is the asshole. The action is meant to stop harassment, which is a noble goal. However, the method might not be the best. But intentions matter. If the author's goal is to stop harassment, even if their method isn't perfect, does that make them in the wrong? Alternatively, if their approach is causing more harm, like making the environment tense without solving the issue, maybe they are.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't harming anyone directly, but their actions might not be the best solution. The response from others is mixed. The question is whether being \"in the wrong\" applies here. Since the author is trying to address a problem, even if their method is debatable, do they deserve to be called an asshole? Or is the intent enough to excuse the method?\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the method is considered appropriate. Some might say that public heckling is not the right way to address harassment because it could be seen as aggressive or attention-seeking. Others might support it as a form of intervention. Since the author is not causing direct harm and is trying to stop harassment, maybe they are not in the wrong. But if their method is counterproductive or makes things worse, then they could be. The fact that people are divided (guys vs. girls) adds complexity.\n\nIn the end, the author's actions are aimed at stopping harassment, which is on the right side. The method might not be perfect, but the intent is good. So the answer might be that they are not in the wrong. However, the author should consider alternative methods that are more supportive to victims and less confrontational. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. So answer B.\n"
