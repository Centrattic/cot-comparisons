Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The user thinks they are, but I need to determine if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author, in a big city, has started responding to cat-calling by making loud \"booo!\" sounds, like a silent movie villain. They acknowledge that other people think they're an asshole. Men think they're a white knight who might get hurt, women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, maybe even create a culture where others tell them to stop. They also admit it's funny to them, but are questioning if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions and the potential consequences. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, which is generally considered unacceptable and harmful. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-caller. But the question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to reduce harassment, which is a positive goal. Publicly confronting harassment can be empowering and may discourage the behavior. However, the method here is to mock the cat-caller. The problem is that this approach might escalate the situation. The author mentions getting cussed at and threats, which could lead to physical confrontation. Even if they feel confident in their physical ability, there's a risk of violence. \n\nAlso, the author's actions might not be the most effective. By drawing attention, they might inadvertently make the situation more confrontational. If a woman is being cat-called, adding a public heckle could make her feel more targeted or embarrassed. The author's method could be seen as taking the focus off the victim, but in reality, it might just make the incident more public in a negative way. \n\nAnother angle: the author is imposing their own judgment on the cat-caller. While cat-calling is wrong, the response should ideally support the victim rather than engage with the harasser in a way that could escalate tension. The author's approach might not be constructive for the cat-caller to realize their wrongdoing; instead, it's a form of mockery that could provoke defensiveness.\n\nHowever, it's also true that bystander intervention can be effective. But the method matters. The more effective approach is often to directly tell the harasser to stop, which can be done calmly and firmly. Mocking might not be the best method. Additionally, the author's actions could be seen as vigilantism, and while the intent is good, the approach might not align with constructive conflict resolution.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a debate about public shaming. Some argue it's a necessary tool for accountability, others say it can be counterproductive. The author's method might not be helping the situation; it could be creating a cycle where both parties are hostile. The fact that others are divided in their opinions adds complexity, but the key is the impact on the victims. If the author's actions are making situations worse for women, even if well-intentioned, that's a problem.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's intention is good, but the method is questionable. They might be causing more harm than good, even if their goal is to stop harassment. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their approach could escalate the situation, not effectively address the harassment, and potentially make things worse for the victims.\n"
