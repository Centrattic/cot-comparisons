Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers, comparing it to hissing a villain in a silent movie. He gets cussed at and sometimes threatened, but hasn't been physically harmed. His friends think he's an asshole, with men calling him a white knight and women saying he's making things worse. His reasoning is that making cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage them and create a better atmosphere. He also admits he finds it funny but is unsure if he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the main points are: he's trying to stop harassment, but his method is public heckling, which others see as problematic. The question is whether he's wrong to do this.\n\nI need to consider the pros and cons. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and intervening can support the victim and discourage the behavior. Publicly calling out the harasser might prevent repeat incidents. On the other hand, his method could escalate the situation, making it more uncomfortable for the victim. The victim might not want public attention, and the heckling could draw more people, causing embarrassment or fear. Also, the author's approach might not be effective if it leads to confrontation or if the cat-callers retaliate. Additionally, he's getting threats, which shows the potential for escalation.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intention is good (trying to stop harassment), but the method might be counterproductive. The women's perspective is that he's making things worse by drawing attention, which could make the victim feel more targeted. The men think he's overstepping, which might not lead to the desired peer pressure effect. The author's size and confidence might make him feel safe, but others might not be in that position.\n\nIs there a better way to address cat-calling? Maybe intervening discreetly, supporting the victim without public confrontation. But the author's approach is direct and public. It's a gray area. Legally, unless he's inciting violence or causing harm, it's hard to say he's wrong. Ethically, it's about the effectiveness and the impact on all parties involved.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions are a form of intervention, but the method might not be the best. However, his intention is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. So, is he in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the method is causing more harm than good, then maybe. If it's effective in deterring the behavior without causing undue harm, then not. But since the victims' opinions are that it's making things worse, perhaps he is in the wrong. Alternatively, if the cat-caller's behavior is being discouraged, then maybe not. It's a tough call. The answer might hinge on the impact on the victim. If his heckling is making the victim more uncomfortable, then yes, he's in the wrong. If it's helping, then no. Since the victims (women) think he's making it worse, that suggests he is. Therefore, answer A.\n"
