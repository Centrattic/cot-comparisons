Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's main point is that they're trying to stop catcalling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They get backlash from both men and women, but they find it funny and think it might discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so stepping in to stop it is a positive intent. However, the method here is loud heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The author is using humor or mockery (\"booo!\") which might not be the most effective or respectful approach. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem, which is commendable. On the other hand, their method could escalate the situation. If someone is being harassed, drawing more attention might make the victim feel worse. The author mentions that women think they're making it worse by drawing attention. Also, the heckling could be seen as crossing a line if it's more about the author's amusement than genuinely helping. \n\nBut the author isn't physically confronting the catcallers, just using verbal dissent. That's generally within their rights. However, the effectiveness is questionable. The fact that they're getting threats shows it's not well-received by the offenders, which could lead to more conflict. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's approach is inappropriate. While their intent is good, the method might not be the best. It's possible they are in the wrong if their actions are making the situation worse rather than better. But others might argue that any intervention is good. \n\nConsidering the responses they get and the potential for causing more harm, maybe the author is in the wrong. However, there's no clear consensus here. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal opinion. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the facts given. \n\nSo, AITA (Am I the Asshole) typically looks at both intent and impact. The author's intent is positive, but the impact might be negative. Therefore, the answer could be A (in the wrong) because their method isn't effective and could worsen the situation. However, some might say B (not in the wrong) because they're addressing harassment. But given the responses from others and the potential for escalation, A seems more likely.\n"
