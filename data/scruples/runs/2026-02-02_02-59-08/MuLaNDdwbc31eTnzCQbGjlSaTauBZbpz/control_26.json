Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author is in a big city and started doing this two months ago. They use a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. People around think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. But they also admit it's funny. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to stop a negative behavior. But their method is public heckling, which might escalate the situation. The author is getting threats, so maybe their approach is confrontational. \n\nThe author's argument is about creating an atmosphere where others also stop such behavior. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they are intervening to stop harassment, maybe they have a good intention. But if their method is causing more harm, like drawing attention or escalating tensions, that's a downside. \n\nThe responses from others are mixed. Men think they're a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, implying that their approach might lead to conflict. Women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author acknowledges that they might be an asshole, showing self-awareness. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, intentions matter, but actions have consequences. If their method is leading to threats and possible violence, even if their goal is good, the approach might be problematic. However, sometimes public shaming is used as a deterrent. But in this case, it's about catcalling, which is a serious issue. \n\nAnother angle: catcalling is a form of harassment, and the author is trying to address it directly. But the author's method could be seen as vigilantism. Depending on the context, maybe they should involve authorities or support the victim instead of confronting the harasser directly. \n\nThe author is a \"fairly big fucker,\" so maybe they can handle threats, but others might not. The question is about being in the wrong. If the cat-caller is at fault, the author is trying to correct that. But if the author's actions are causing more harm than good, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nIn some cases, public confrontation can escalate the situation, leading to violence. The author's heckling might not be the best approach. Maybe a safer way is to support the person being catcalled rather than confronting the harasser. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intentions are good, but the method might be flawed. They might be causing unnecessary conflict and not effectively stopping harassment. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are wrong). Or B (they aren't), if the good intentions outweigh the method. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is well-intentioned but causes issues, maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if stopping harassment is right, even if the method isn't perfect, they aren't wrong. \n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the method justifies the intention. If the author's approach leads to more harm (threats, drawing attention), maybe they are in the wrong. But if it's a form of standing up against harassment, then not. \n\nI think in this context, the author's actions are a form of direct intervention with good intentions but possibly poor execution. The fact that other people think they're an asshole and it's making things worse suggests that the method is problematic. Therefore, the correct answer is A (they are wrong).\n"
