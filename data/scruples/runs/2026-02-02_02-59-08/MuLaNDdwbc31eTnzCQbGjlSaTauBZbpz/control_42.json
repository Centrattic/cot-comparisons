Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-collars. The situation is that he's been doing this for two months, using a \"booo\" like in a silent movie. He's facing backlash from both men and women, and he's unsure if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Catcalling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to confront it directly. But the question is whether his method is wrong. On one hand, he's standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. He wants to make the catcallers uncomfortable to discourage their behavior. That's a good motive.\n\nHowever, the method he's using is public heckling. This could escalate the situation. By calling out the catcallers loudly, he might be drawing more attention to the situation. The women's perspective is that it's making things worse by attracting more notice. Also, his approach might not be safe. He mentions getting cursed at and threats. Even if he feels physically capable, it's a risky situation that could lead to violence.\n\nAnother angle: is his method effective? If he's making the catcallers uncomfortable, maybe that reduces the behavior. But if it's causing more confrontation, it could lead to more problems. Also, the author admits to enjoying the situation, which might make it seem like he's not taking the issue seriously. It's a bit of a hypocritical stance if he's using humor in a serious context.\n\nLegal considerations? In some places, intervening in harassment might be protected, but if the heckling itself is aggressive, it could be seen as provocation. The line between self-defense and inciting a conflict is thin here.\n\nSocial norms play a role too. Different cities have different tolerances for public confrontations. If the author is in a place where this method isn't effective or is frowned upon, his approach isn't helpful. Also, there's the aspect of bystander intervention. The best practices usually recommend things like reporting, supporting the victim, or using non-confrontational methods. Loud heckling isn't the standard advised approach.\n\nBut then again, some might argue that any action to reduce harassment is positive. The author's intention is good, but the method might be causing more harm than good. He's putting himself in danger and possibly escalating the situation for others involved.\n\nSo, weighing the pros and cons: good intentions vs. potential negative consequences. The author's method is controversial and might not be the best approach. He's not in the wrong for trying to stop harassment, but his specific approach could be problematic. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong\" for doing this. Since the method might be ineffective or harmful, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). But others might say B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to do the right thing. It's a tricky balance between activism and public safety.\n"
