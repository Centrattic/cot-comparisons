Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and dislikes cat-calling. They started heckling the cat-callers by making loud \"booo\" sounds like in a silent movie. They get some negative reactions like curses and threats, but no physical confrontations. Friends and others think they're an asshole because they're drawing attention and not helping. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, maybe even create a culture where others stop it. They also admit they find it funny, which adds a bit of hypocrisy.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to address a negative behavior. Their method is public shaming through heckling. The question is whether this response crosses a line into being the problem.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop harassment, which is a positive intent. Public shaming can be a form of intervention. However, loud heckling might escalate the situation. The author mentions others think it's making things worse by drawing attention. There's also the risk that the heckling could be seen as a personal attack on the cat-caller, potentially leading to conflict. Even if the author is bigger and hasn't been harmed yet, the threats they receive suggest that their method could lead to danger. Also, the author's own admission of finding it funny might mean their motivation isn't purely altruistic.\n\nOn the other hand, the cat-caller is the initial aggressor. The author is taking a stand against harassment, which is a valid concern. However, the method used\u2014public shaming with loud noises\u2014might not be the most effective or safe way to address the issue. It could inadvertently make the situation more confrontational, which could put everyone involved at risk. Additionally, the author's approach might not actually stop the harassment; it could just make the cat-caller more aggressive or cause bystanders to feel uncomfortable.\n\nThere's also the aspect of bystander intervention. Some training suggests that direct confrontation can be risky and might not always be the best approach. The author's method could be seen as a form of intervention, but if it's causing more harm than good (by escalating tensions or drawing unwanted attention), then it might not be effective. The fact that people around them are split in their opinions\u2014some seeing them as a white knight and others as an asshole\u2014indicates that the method is controversial.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author's intent is to prevent harassment, which is good, but the means must be proportionate and non-violent. However, heckling could be seen as a form of harassment itself, even if it's directed at the harasser. The line between defending someone and becoming a harasser yourself is thin. The author's approach might not be the most constructive way to address the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to stop a negative behavior, their method of public heckling could be counterproductive and potentially escalate the situation. The fact that it's causing conflict and others perceive it as harmful suggests that the author might be in the wrong, even if their original intent is to help. The answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
