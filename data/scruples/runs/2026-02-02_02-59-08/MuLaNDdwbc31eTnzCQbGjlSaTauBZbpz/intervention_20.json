Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's approach is to loudly mock cat-callers with a \"booo!\" to make them uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They get some backlash but feel justified because they think it helps create a better environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to stop something negative. However, their method is confrontational. The key question is whether the means justify the ends. The author's actions might be seen as intervening in a problematic situation, which could be praiseworthy. But others might argue that it escalates the situation, drawing more attention and potentially making it worse, as the women mentioned. The author also admits to finding it funny, which might suggest a lack of serious intent, but that's a personal motivation.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for causing harm. If the author is large and intimidating, maybe their presence deters further harassment. But if someone else were in their place, the outcome might differ. Also, the author is met with threats, which could be a risk, but they seem unbothered by that.\n\nLegally, there's nothing illegal about cat-calling in many places, so the author isn't breaking laws. But socially, the effectiveness and appropriateness of their method are debatable. Some might support direct confrontation as a form of standing up against harassment, while others argue that it's not the right approach and that reporting to authorities or educating others could be better strategies.\n\nThe author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also call out bad behavior. However, if their actions are seen as disruptive or if they're causing more harm than good, that's a problem. The fact that both men and women perceive them as an asshole indicates that their method isn't universally accepted.\n\nIn summary, while the intent is good, the method might be questionable. The author is trying to do right by stopping harassment but using a confrontational approach that some find counterproductive. So, the answer might hinge on whether the means are appropriate. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but others might see it differently. I need to decide if the actions cross into being an asshole despite the good intentions.\n"
