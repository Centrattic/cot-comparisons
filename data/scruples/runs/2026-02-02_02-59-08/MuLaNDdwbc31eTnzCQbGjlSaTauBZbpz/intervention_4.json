Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds. The author mentions that cat-calling is a pet peeve, and they started this in a big city. They acknowledge that people think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author is trying to combat this, which on the surface seems good. But their method is public heckling, which might escalate the situation. The question is whether this approach is justified or if it's making things worse.\n\nThe author says they get cursed at and threatened, but haven't been physically harmed. However, the people around them think they're causing more attention, which could make the victim feel worse. The \"white knight\" comment from guys suggests that some might see the author as overstepping, trying to be a hero without considering the consequences. Women's perspective is that it draws attention and makes the situation worse, which is a valid concern. If the victim is already uncomfortable, adding another person's intervention might not be helpful and could even be intimidating.\n\nThe author's intention is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. But is that effective? Maybe in some cases, but if it leads to confrontation, it could escalate. Also, the author admits they find it funny, which might imply they're enjoying the confrontation, which could be seen as insensitivity.\n\nThe key here is whether the method is appropriate. Publicly shaming someone might not be the best approach. It's possible that the author's actions are causing more harm than good, even if their intention is good. The fact that others around them think they're an asshole suggests that the community doesn't support this method. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a problem. But the approach might be counterproductive. Maybe there are better ways to intervene, like directly telling the cat-caller to stop, or supporting the victim in a way that doesn't escalate. Alternatively, using non-confrontational methods. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking action but not considering the potential negative impacts. So, while their intent is to prevent harassment, their method could be seen as part of the problem. Hence, they might be in the wrong for not respecting the context and possibly causing more harm.\n"
