Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. So, first, what's the situation? The author is in a big city, and they've started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers. They get some backlash, but they think their actions might discourage the behavior. People around them think they're an asshole, with some saying it makes things worse.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about the ethics of public confrontation. The author is trying to address a problem they dislike\u2014catcalling. But their method is to publicly shame the cat-callers. Now, catcalling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. So the author is trying to stop something bad, which is good, but their approach might be problematic.\n\nOn one hand, intervening to stop harassment is positive. But the author is using a confrontational method that might not be effective. The \"booo\" is meant to make the cat-caller uncomfortable. But does that escalate the situation? If the cat-caller then reacts angrily, maybe it makes the harassment worse for the person being targeted. For example, if someone is being catcalled and then the heckler gets involved, the cat-caller might take their anger out on the victim, or the heckler's actions could draw more attention, making the situation more intimidating.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others think they're an asshole. The guys think they're a \"white knight,\" implying that they're overstepping, and women think it's making things worse. The author is big and hasn't been physically confronted yet, but some people might see it as unnecessary confrontation.\n\nAnother angle is the method of intervention. Directly confronting a cat-caller in a public way might not be the safest or most effective approach. Some experts suggest that interventions should be done carefully to avoid putting oneself or others in danger. For instance, a more direct approach might be to tell the cat-caller to stop, or to report the behavior to authorities if possible. But the author's method might be seen as more of a public shaming tactic, which could backfire.\n\nThe author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage them. However, it's possible that the cat-caller is already not concerned about being a jerk, so the heckling might not have the intended effect. Additionally, the heckling could lead to increased aggression from the cat-caller, which could endanger others.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is trying to do good but might be causing unintended harm. The question is whether their actions, despite good intentions, are causing more problems. The fact that others in the community, including women, think it's making things worse suggests that the method might not be appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intentions are good, but their approach may be counterproductive and potentially harmful. The answer would be that they are in the wrong because their method of intervention is causing more issues rather than solving the problem.\n"
