Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds. The author's intention is to stop the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the cat-caller. They mention getting negative reactions but haven't faced physical consequences.\n\nFirst, consider the ethics. Catcalling is generally seen as harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to counter this, which is a positive intent. However, the method involves public shaming. Public shaming can be a gray area. While it might discourage the behavior, it can also escalate tension. The author acknowledges that others see them as an asshole, with some people thinking it draws more attention or could make things worse. But others, like some women, might appreciate the intervention.\n\nLegal aspects: In many places, catcalling is not illegal unless it's part of a pattern of harassment. The author isn't using physical force, just verbal. So they're not breaking laws here. But does their response cross a line? If they're loud enough to be heard, maybe they're disrupting public order, but that's subjective.\n\nSocial norms: Public shaming isn't always accepted. Some might see it as vigilantism. The author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical retaliation, but threats exist. Even if they feel justified, others might not agree with the approach. The author's own friends think they're an asshole, so there's social backlash.\n\nEffectiveness: The author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also stop catcalling. But loud heckling might not be the best way. It could lead to more confrontations. Some studies suggest that bystander intervention works when done calmly and directly. The \"booo\" might not be effective and could be seen as mocking rather than constructive.\n\nIntent vs. Impact: The author's intent is good, but the impact might be negative. Women might feel that the situation is now more confrontational, which could make them uncomfortable. Also, the author's amusement at the situation (\"I find it funny\") might trivialize a serious issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to stop harassment, the method used could be counterproductive. Public shaming might not be the best approach and could be seen as aggressive or attention-seeking. The author might be in the right in intent but wrong in execution. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the method is acceptable. Since there's a debate here, but the author isn't using violence and is trying to address a problem, it's a bit nuanced. But given the social backlash and potential for escalation, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
