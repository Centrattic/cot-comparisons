Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds. The person is trying to discourage cat-calling by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. They've been doing this for two months and have received both criticism and threats in response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, and the person is opposing that behavior. Their method is direct confrontation but in a non-physical way. The author's approach is to mock the cat-callers, which might be seen as a form of support for victims and a deterrent for the harassers. However, others argue that this could escalate the situation or draw unwanted attention.\n\nThe author mentions that some people think they're a white knight (which could imply overstepping) and others think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to create discomfort for the cat-callers to discourage future behavior and foster a culture where others also speak up. However, they also admit to finding it funny, which might be seen as a less serious motive.\n\nNow, considering if they're in the wrong. Legally, unless the heckling is threatening or inciting violence, it's probably protected speech. Ethically, it's more nuanced. Intervening against harassment is generally seen as positive, but the method matters. If the heckling is non-confrontational and doesn't escalate, it's harder to argue against. However, if it leads to confrontations or puts others at risk, that's a different story. The threats from the cat-callers suggest that the author's actions are provocative, but the author claims not to back down.\n\nThe key points are: the action is against harassment, the method is verbal and non-violent, but it could be seen as provocative. The opinions of others are split, but the author's intention is to stop harassment. The question is whether the method is appropriate. If the author's actions don't endanger others and actually help deter harassment, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the heckling causes more harm (like making the situation tense or encouraging retaliation), then maybe they are.\n\nBut in this case, the author isn't using violence, just verbal jabs. So, from a moral standpoint, supporting victims and discouraging harassment is positive. The author's method is a form of intervention, which is admirable. Even if others disapprove, the intent is good. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the heckling could be seen as taking the focus off the victim and putting it on the intervenor, which isn't ideal. But if the cat-caller is being discouraged, that's a net positive.\n\nAlso, the author is aware of the risks and hasn't faced physical consequences yet. The threats are verbal, so perhaps the method isn't overly aggressive. So, considering all factors, the author's actions are a form of standing up against harassment, which is commendable. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
