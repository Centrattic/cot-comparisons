Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-calls is in the wrong. The situation is that they're loudly reacting to cat-calling by saying \"booo!\", which is meant to mock the perpetrators. They've received some negative reactions from people around them, with others thinking they're an asshole. The rationale is that by making the cat-callers uncomfortable, they want to discourage such behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop this by publicly shaming the offenders. But is public shaming a proportionate response? On one hand, the author is trying to support the victims and create a safer environment. On the other hand, their method might escalate the situation or draw unwanted attention, potentially making the victims more uncomfortable. Also, the author mentions that people think they're an asshole, which suggests that their approach might not be well-received by others. \n\nAnother angle: the author's method could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. While the intent is good, the method might not be the most effective. Maybe a better approach would be to report the cat-calling to authorities or support the victims in other ways. However, the author's action could also be viewed as standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author's actions are causing discomfort to the cat-callers and not the victims, perhaps it's justified. However, if the heckling is making the victims feel more targeted or unsafe, then it's problematic. The author admits to finding it funny, which might trivialize the seriousness of cat-calling. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that direct intervention is okay, while others think it's not their place. The key factors are intent vs. impact. The author's intent is to discourage harassment, but the impact could be mixed. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a problem, but their method might need adjustment. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the responses from others, both men and women have mixed views. The author isn't causing physical harm, but the verbal response could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. If the author is a \"fairly big fucker\" and no one has physically confronted them, maybe their approach is effective in deterring the cat-callers. However, the author's own admission that people think they're an asshole is a red flag. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method might not be the right approach. The author could be in the wrong if their actions are causing more harm than good, such as drawing attention to the victims or creating a confrontational atmosphere. But if it's effectively stopping the harassment without causing additional harm, maybe not. Given the mixed reactions and potential for negative impact, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because their method might not be the best approach and could be seen as overstepping.\n"
