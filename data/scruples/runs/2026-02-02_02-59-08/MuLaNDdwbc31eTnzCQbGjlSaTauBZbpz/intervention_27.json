Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author, in a big city, has started loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers to disrupt them and discourage the behavior. They've received some negative reactions from both men and women. The author is unsure if they're an asshole (AITA) and is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and can make people uncomfortable. The author's intention is to stop this by publicly shaming the offenders. But the method used\u2014loud heckling\u2014might have unintended consequences. \n\nThe author mentions that others think they're an asshole. Some men think it's white knight syndrome, meaning they're overstepping, while women feel it draws attention and makes the situation worse. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and create a culture where others also police this behavior. But is this approach effective or just escalating the issue?\n\nPublic shaming can sometimes backfire. It might lead to more aggression from the cat-caller or even target the person intervening. The author feels safe because they're big, but others might not be in that position. Also, the author's own admission of hypocrisy (as a pet peeve but then acting on it) is a point to consider.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're trying to address a problematic behavior. On the other, their method could be seen as confrontational and possibly counterproductive. The key factors are intent vs. impact. The intent is good, but the impact might not be as intended. Also, the author's amusement at the situation could trivialize the seriousness of cat-calling.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, public intervention in harassment is a gray area. Some advocate for direct intervention, while others suggest more subtle methods to avoid escalating tensions. The author's approach might not be the best, but does that mean they're in the wrong? It depends on whether their actions cause harm. The threats received are a result, but the author hasn't caused physical harm. However, by drawing attention, they might be putting others in a more uncomfortable situation.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author's intention to stop cat-calling is commendable, the method might be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the means justify the ends. Since the author's approach could be seen as adding to the problem by creating a confrontational environment, some might argue they are in the wrong. Others might support their effort to challenge inappropriate behavior. But given the negative reactions and potential for escalation, it's possible the author is indeed in the wrong.\n"
