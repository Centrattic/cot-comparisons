Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has started doing this for two months after moving to a big city. They use a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie villain. The responses they get are mostly negative from both men and women, but the author thinks it might discourage cat-calling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so trying to stop it is a positive intent. The author's method is to make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller, which could deter them. However, the method involves public humiliation, which some might see as excessive or counterproductive. The question is whether this approach is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intent is good. They want to stop harassment, which is a valid concern. Publicly shaming the cat-callers might prevent future incidents. On the other hand, some argue that it draws attention to the situation, potentially making the victim more uncomfortable. Also, the author's approach could escalate tensions, leading to physical confrontations as mentioned with the threats. Even though the author is physically bigger, it's still a risky situation.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does this method actually help? If it creates a supportive environment where others also speak up, it could work. But if it's just the author doing it, maybe it's not the best approach. The author mentions that people think they're an asshole, which is a social judgment. But social norms around confronting harassment can vary. In some contexts, speaking up is encouraged; in others, it's seen as overstepping.\n\nLegal aspects? Probably not a legal issue here unless it turns into physical violence. Since it's loud heckling, it's more of a social interaction. The author isn't using violence, just verbal dissent. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's intent is positive, but the method might be problematic. However, given that cat-calling is a form of harassment, intervening in some way is usually seen as correct. The key is whether the method is appropriate. Public humiliation could be seen as a valid tactic in some circles, but others might prefer a different approach. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the method is justified by the intent. If the method is effective and doesn't cause more harm than good, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if it's causing more issues (like making victims uncomfortable or escalating problems), then maybe they are. The author's rationale is to discourage future behavior, which is a valid goal. The fact that others think they're an asshole is a social opinion, but not necessarily a moral judgment. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are intended to stop harassment, which is a good cause. While the method might not be perfect, the intent is positive, and the author isn't using violence. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a counterargument that they should find a different way. However, given that they're not hurting anyone and trying to address a harmful behavior, it's more about the effectiveness rather than being 'in the wrong' ethically.\n"
