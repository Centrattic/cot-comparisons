Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, the author is responding to cat-calling by loudly \"booo!\"-ing the perpetrators. They mention that this has led to some negative reactions but they haven't been physically harmed. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, aiming to create a better atmosphere.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives: some people think the author is a \"white knight\" risking a confrontation, while others, especially women, think they're drawing unnecessary attention and making the situation worse. The author also admits to finding it funny, which might be seen as not taking the issue seriously enough.\n\nCat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful. The author's response, while intended to stop it, might escalate the situation. The method involves direct confrontation, which can be risky. Even though the intent is good, the approach could be seen as provocative. If the author is making a scene, it might not help the person being cat-called, who might feel more embarrassed or targeted by the heckling. Also, the threats from the cat-callers suggest that the author's actions are not effective and might be counterproductive. \n\nThe author's size might help them avoid physical harm, but others might not be as fortunate. The key issue is whether the method is appropriate. While the intent is to stop harassment, the method could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment rather than resolving it. The author might be overstepping by taking on a vigilante role, which could lead to more conflict than resolution. Therefore, the action, despite good intentions, might be considered wrong because it's disruptive and potentially ineffective, not addressing the root issue but adding to the problem.\n"
