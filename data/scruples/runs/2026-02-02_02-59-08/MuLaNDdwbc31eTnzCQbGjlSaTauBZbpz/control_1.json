Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo\" sounds. The author's rationale is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. However, others think the author is an asshole, with some saying it draws attention and makes things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and can make others feel harassed. The author is trying to address that by publicly shaming the perpetrators. But is that the right approach? Public shaming can sometimes escalate situations. The author mentions that people get angry and even threaten them, but the author is physically bigger and no one has followed through. So maybe there's a risk of conflict here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop harassment, which is a valid concern. On the other, their method might be counterproductive. If the cat-caller is being heckled, maybe the target of the cat-calling feels more embarrassed or unsafe. The girls' perspective that it draws attention and makes things worse is a valid point. Also, the author's own admission that they find it funny complicates things. It seems like they might be enjoying the confrontation, which could come off as judgmental or even performative.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility. The author is taking it upon themselves to police others' behavior. While that might be well-intentioned, it's possible that the author's actions could lead to more conflict. Public shaming isn't always effective; sometimes it just creates more hostility without solving the underlying issue. The author's method might not address why the cat-caller is acting that way, and could instead lead to more aggression.\n\nBut then again, if the author's actions deter others from cat-calling, maybe that's a positive outcome. However, the author's own enjoyment of the situation and the potential for making things worse for the victims (by drawing attention) are red flags. The key here is whether the method is constructive. Public shaming can sometimes backfire, and there's a risk of the author being seen as confrontational rather than supportive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent to stop harassment is commendable, the method might be inappropriate and could indeed be making the situation worse. The author's actions could be perceived as confrontational and potentially harmful, even if their intentions are good. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their approach, despite their good intentions.\n"
