Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who writes about heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has been loudly boos at cat-callers for two months. They do this because they dislike random guys shouting at others. The cat-caller usually responds with curses or threats but hasn't acted on them. The author is big and hasn't been attacked yet. People around think they're an asshole, both men and women. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nSo the question is whether the author's actions are wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is trying to address this, which could be seen as standing up against harassment. Their method is to publicly shame the cat-callers, which might deter them. That could be a positive outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that the author is escalating the situation. The author's heckling might draw more attention, making the victim feel worse or putting them in a more uncomfortable situation. Also, the author is using a confrontational approach, which could lead to conflict. The women's perspective is that it makes the situation worse, which is a valid concern. The author is also getting threats, which shows that their approach might be confrontational and potentially risky.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intention is to discourage bad behavior, which is good, but the method might not be the most effective. Instead of creating a hostile environment, maybe there are better ways to address the issue without involving oneself in a conflict. Also, the author is taking it upon themselves to police others, which could be seen as overstepping, even if the intent is good.\n\nAlso, the author admits they find it funny, which might indicate that they're using this as a form of entertainment, which could trivialize the harassment the victims are experiencing. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while standing up against harassment is important, the method matters. Public shaming can have mixed results. It might discourage some, but it could also lead to the accused becoming defensive or more aggressive. There's also the risk of the situation escalating to physical confrontation, even if it hasn't happened yet. \n\nLegal considerations: In some places, intervening to stop harassment is encouraged, but if the intervention leads to a confrontation, it could result in legal issues for the intervener if it escalates to violence. However, the author hasn't faced that yet, but the threats suggest that there's potential.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to stop harassment against the methods used. The author's actions might be seen as well-intentioned but misguided. They might be causing more harm than good, even if that's not their intention. The people around them, especially the women, think it's making things worse, which is a significant point. \n\nTherefore, the author could be in the wrong because their method might not be effective and could be counterproductive. However, others might argue that it's a form of taking a stand. But considering the potential harm and the fact that others are advising against it, it's possible that the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
