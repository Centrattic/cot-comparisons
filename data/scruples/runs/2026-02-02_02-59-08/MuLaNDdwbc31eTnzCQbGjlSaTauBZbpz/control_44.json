Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" noises. The author has been doing this for two months in a big city. They mention that guys think they're a \"white knight\" and might get beaten up, while girls think they're making it worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere.\n\nHmm. First, I need to evaluate whether the author's actions are justified or not. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and unwanted. The author is trying to stop it, but their method is public heckling. The question is whether this method is acceptable or if it crosses a line.\n\nOn one side, the author is standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. They might feel that direct intervention is necessary since others don't act. However, the method of \"booo\"-ing could escalate the situation. The cat-caller might become more aggressive if confronted, and the author's own safety could be at risk. Also, by drawing attention, it might make the situation more uncomfortable for everyone involved, including the victim. The girls' perspective here is that it's making it worse, which is a valid concern.\n\nAnother angle: is the author overstepping? If the author is not the one being harassed, maybe they shouldn't be the one to confront the cat-caller. It could be seen as inserting themselves into a situation where they're not the target. That might come off as performative or as a form of white knight behavior, as the guys mentioned. Also, the author's own safety is a factor\u2014they mention getting cursed at and threats, which could lead to physical altercations.\n\nBut then again, in some contexts, public shaming or immediate intervention is considered a good way to stop harassment. It might discourage others from doing it too. The author's size might mean they can handle the threats, but that doesn't mean others can. There's also the aspect of bystander intervention. Some studies suggest that interventions can be effective if done safely.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intent is good, but the impact might be negative. By making a scene, they could be putting more pressure on the victims or escalating the situation. It's a balance between stopping harassment and how to do it effectively without causing more harm.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might say that the author is taking justice into their own hands, which isn't the job of the authorities. Others might support it as a form of community accountability. However, the fact that both men and women think the author is an asshole suggests there's a debate here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's not a clear yes or no. The action is meant to help, but the method may have unintended consequences. The author should consider safer and more effective ways to address cat-calling, like reporting to authorities or supporting policies that address harassment. Their current method might be counterproductive. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while the intent is positive, the method is problematic and could cause more harm than good.\n"
