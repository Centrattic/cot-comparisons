Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author has been loudly \"booo\"ing them like a silent movie villain. They mention getting cussing and threats in return. People around think they're an asshole, with different opinions from guys and girls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered unwanted and harassing behavior. The author's intention is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. They also want to create a culture where others tell the cat-callers to stop. But some people think it's making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nIs the author's action justified? On one hand, they're trying to address a problem. On the other, their method might escalate the situation. Publicly shaming someone can lead to tension and possible conflict. The author is using confrontation, which might not be the best approach. The fact that they're getting threats suggests it's not effective and could be dangerous. Also, the author admits they find it funny, which might downplay the seriousness of their actions.\n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. There are recommended ways to intervene safely, like using non-confrontational methods. Yelling at the cat-caller might not be the most effective or safe method. The author's size might make them feel secure, but others might not be in that position. Creating an atmosphere where others feel comfortable to act is a good goal, but the method here might not be the best path.\n\nSo, while the intent is positive, the method could be harmful. The author might be causing more harm than good by escalating situations. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because their approach is likely counterproductive and risky.\n"
