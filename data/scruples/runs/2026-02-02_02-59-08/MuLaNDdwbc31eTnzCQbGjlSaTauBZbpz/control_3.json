Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has started doing this in a big city, using \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. People around think he's an asshole, with both men and women criticizing him. He argues that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to determine if the author's actions are morally or socially wrong. The key points are catcalling being a problem, the author's method of confronting it by public shaming with heckling, and the mixed reactions from others.\n\nCatcalling is generally considered harassment and is disrespectful. The author's intent is to stop it by making the perpetrators uncomfortable. But the method involves public humiliation, which could be seen as a form of confrontation. However, is this justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't physically confronting them, just using verbal heckling. It's a non-violent way to address the issue. Some might see it as standing up against harassment. On the other hand, the author is adding to the confrontation, which could escalate the situation. The women's perspective is that it draws more attention, making the harassment worse. Also, the author is getting threats, which might indicate that the approach is aggressive.\n\nThe question is whether the author's method is acceptable. The author's rationale is that it's a way to create a deterrent effect. But does this method cross into being an asshole? If the author's actions are causing more conflict rather than resolving it, maybe there's a problem. Also, considering the mixed opinions, some see it as a positive action, others as negative. The author is aware of the hypocrisy (their own pet peeve) and is questioning their approach.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author's method is effective in stopping the catcalling, maybe it's justified. However, if it's causing more harm or drawing attention, it might not be the best approach. But is it the author's fault? The catcallers are the ones initiating the harassment. The author is reacting to it. However, the method of reaction could be problematic. Public shaming can be a form of mobbing, and while the intent is good, the method may be counterproductive.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the means justify the ends. The author's actions are a form of intervention, which some support and others criticize. The author is not physically harming anyone, just using verbal protest. In that case, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, as they're trying to address harassment. However, the effectiveness and the potential to escalate conflict might mean they are acting in a way that's not constructive. But the initial question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which could be a moral judgment. If the author's intent is to stop harassment, and their method is non-violent, maybe they are not in the wrong. But if the method is causing more issues, perhaps they are. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer could swing either way. But given the options, maybe the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, while well-intentioned, may exacerbate the problem and draw attention, which the women point out. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they are trying to address harassment. Hmm. The question is about the author's moral standing. If the community is divided, but the author's actions are non-violent and aimed at stopping harassment, maybe they are not in the wrong. But if the method is counterproductive, maybe they are. I think it's a close call. In most cases, public shaming can be seen as unconstructive. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
