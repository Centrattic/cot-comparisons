Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the person has been loudly booing cat-callers for two months after moving to a big city. They do this because they find random shouting at people annoying. They get cursed at in return but haven't been physically attacked yet. Their friends think they're an asshole, with guys saying they're asking for a beatdown and girls thinking they're making things worse. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others tell off the cat-callers. They also admit it's funny to them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop it by publicly shaming the cat-callers. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is positive. On the other hand, their method might be seen as confrontational and possibly escalating the situation. The author is using public humiliation as a deterrent. \n\nBut is this their responsibility? Maybe they shouldn't take the law into their own hands. However, societal norms are changing, and people are encouraged to speak out against harassment. The question is whether the author's method is appropriate. \n\nThe author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical harm, but threats exist. Some might argue that intervening is good, even if it's done in a loud way. Others might say it's not their role and could make the situation worse by drawing attention, as the girls think. The author's justification is about creating a deterrent, which could be valid, but there's a risk of escalation. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is trying to correct a wrong. However, the method might not be the most effective. The key here is balancing the right to free speech (the author's right to heckle) against the potential consequences. If the author's actions lead to more conflict, maybe that's a problem. But if they're preventing harassment, that's a positive outcome. \n\nIt's a gray area. The author isn't committing a crime by heckling, but the effectiveness and appropriateness of their method are debatable. The answer might depend on context. Since the author isn't physically harming anyone and is using verbal intervention, some might say they're not in the wrong. Others might think they're overstepping. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're challenging harassing behavior, even if their method is questionable. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if their actions are seen as unnecessary escalation. But since the intent is good and the method is non-violent, leaning towards B.\n"
