Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author justifies it by wanting to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. But others think it's making things worse. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to stop that. But their method is to \"booo\" at the cat-callers, which might be seen as confronting them publicly. The cat-callers respond with curses and threats, but the author is physically big and no one has acted on the threats yet.\n\nThe author's rationale is about creating an atmosphere where others also stop the behavior. But some people think he's an asshole because he's drawing attention. So, is the method effective or counterproductive?\n\nI should think about the ethics here. Is the author's action a form of standing up against harassment, or is it just adding to the conflict? If the author is using humor or public shaming, does that cross a line? Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might be seen as using the situation for personal amusement, which could be problematic.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a harmful behavior. On the other hand, their method might escalate the situation, making the target of the cat-calling feel more embarrassed or in danger. The author's approach could be seen as aggressive, even if well-intentioned. It might not address the root issue and could lead to more hostility.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's intervention is more harmful than the original cat-calling. If the heckling causes the cat-caller to stop, it's positive. But if it makes the situation worse for everyone involved, including bystanders, then it's negative. Also, the author's size and the threats received suggest that there's a power dynamic where the author feels safe, but others might not.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about intent and impact. The author's intent is to discourage harassment, but the impact might be unintended consequences. The author might be overstepping, believing they're helping when actually causing more issues. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because their method is counterproductive and possibly harmful, even if the goal is good.\n"
