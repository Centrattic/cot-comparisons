Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a big city and has started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers to make them uncomfortable. They get cussed out and threats, but no one physically confronts them. People around think they're an asshole, both men and women. The author's reasoning is that by making the cat-callers uncomfortable, they might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's consider the arguments for both sides.\n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unacceptable. The author is trying to stop a harmful behavior, which is admirable. Publicly confronting the harasser might prevent further incidents and support the victim. The author isn't physically aggressive; they're just making noise. So, in that sense, their intentions are good, and they're taking a stand against harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's method of heckling could escalate the situation. The cat-caller might become more aggressive if confronted, potentially putting the victim in more danger. Also, if the author is loud, it could draw attention to the situation, which the victim might not want. The women's perspective is that it's making things worse, so maybe the author isn't considering the victim's needs. Also, the author is being confrontational, which might not be the best approach in a public space where things can get volatile.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of free speech and the right to address harassment. If someone is being harassed, others have the right to intervene. The author isn't causing physical harm; they're just expressing disapproval. Also, the fact that the cat-callers respond with threats shows that the author's actions are having an impact on the harassers, which could deter future harassment.\n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. Studies suggest that sometimes bystander intervention can help reduce harassment. However, the method matters. The author's approach might not be the most effective or safest. Maybe a better approach would be to support the victim discreetly or report the harassment to authorities. But the author is trying to create a public deterrent, which might be effective in changing social norms.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions are crossing a line. Since they are not physically aggressive and are trying to stop harassment, their intentions are good. However, the effectiveness and potential negative consequences (like drawing more attention) are points against them. But given that harassment is a serious issue, standing up against it is generally seen as positive. The fact that they are facing backlash but still persisting shows commitment, but maybe they need a different approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while possibly not the most tactful, are aimed at stopping harassment. Their intentions are good, and unless their method is causing more harm than good, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The women's perspective that it's making things worse is valid, but the author's method is non-violent and might still contribute to a culture where harassment is not tolerated. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that there might be better ways to handle it.\n"
