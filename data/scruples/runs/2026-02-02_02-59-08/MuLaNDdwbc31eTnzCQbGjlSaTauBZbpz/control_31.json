Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is in a big city, and they've started loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers to make them uncomfortable and maybe stop the behavior. They get cussed at and some threats, but no one has physically confront them. The opinions from others are split: guys think they're a \"white knight\" risking a beating, girls think they're making it worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a culture where others tell the cat-caller off. They also admit it's funny for them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the act itself. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and unwelcome. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. But their method is public heckling, which could be seen as a form of intervention. But is this intervention appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, intervening in public to stop harassment can be seen as standing up against it. However, the way they're doing it\u2014making loud noises\u2014might not be the most effective method. The author's approach could escalate the situation. For example, if the cat-caller is provoked, there could be a physical confrontation, even if the author is big and hasn't been attacked yet. Also, the author admits that others think they're making things worse. Women think it draws attention, which could make the victim feel more embarrassed or targeted. \n\nAnother angle: The author's motivation includes a desire to create a culture where others tell cat-callers off. But maybe a more effective method would be to report the behavior, or support the victim discreetly instead of drawing attention. The heckling could also be seen as taking the focus off the victim and putting it on the heckler, which isn't ideal. \n\nAdditionally, the author acknowledges their own hypocrisy in the pet peeve, suggesting they might not fully understand the dynamics of harassment. Using humor (\"find it funny\") might trivialize the seriousness of the issue for victims.\n\nSo, considering all that, while the intent is good, the method might be counterproductive. The author could be causing more harm than good by escalating situations, drawing unwanted attention, and potentially making victims feel worse. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because their method isn't effective and might be harmful, even if the intent is good.\n"
