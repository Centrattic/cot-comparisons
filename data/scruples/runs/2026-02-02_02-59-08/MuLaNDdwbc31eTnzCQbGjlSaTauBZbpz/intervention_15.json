Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They started this after moving to a big city, probably because they're annoyed by the cat-calling. Their method is to make a loud \"booo!\" sound, like a silent movie villain getting booed. They admit they get cussed at and threatened, but they're physically big and no one has actually attacked them yet.\n\nThey mention that others think they're an asshole. Men think they're a \"white knight\" (which might mean they're trying to be a hero but are clueless or overstepping), and women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The person's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others tell the cat-caller off. They also admit they find it funny, which complicates things because it's not purely altruistic.\n\nSo, the core question is whether the ends justify the means. Cat-calling is obviously problematic and disrespectful, so trying to stop it is a good intention. But the method here could be counterproductive. Using loud public heckling might escalate the situation. If the cat-caller gets angry and reacts violently, it could lead to a worse outcome. Also, the person is using humor (making it funny) which might not be the best approach in a serious issue like harassment.\n\nAnother angle: public confrontation can sometimes make the victim (the person being cat-called) more uncomfortable. If the heckler's presence draws attention, it might make the situation more stressful for them. Women might feel like they have to deal with both the cat-caller and the heckler, which isn't helpful. The author's approach could be seen as inserting themselves into a situation where they're not necessarily welcome, even if their intentions are good.\n\nAlso, the threats they receive suggest that their method is provoking hostility. Even if they're not physically harmed, the confrontation could lead to a more hostile environment overall. It's possible that the cat-caller's reaction could escalate, leading to violence, which the heckler didn't anticipate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention to deter cat-calling is valid. But the method might not be effective. Studies or social experiments on bystander intervention suggest that direct, calm approaches are more effective. For example, telling the cat-caller to stop or showing disapproval without escalation. The loud \"booo!\" might not be as effective and could be seen as mocking, which doesn't address the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's method is problematic. They might be well-intentioned, but their actions could be counterproductive and potentially harmful. The fact that others (both men and women) see them as an asshole or making things worse supports that idea. The humor aspect also undercuts the seriousness of the issue, which could be inconsiderate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
