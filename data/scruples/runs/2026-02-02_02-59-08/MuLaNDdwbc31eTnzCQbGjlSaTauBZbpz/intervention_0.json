Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They provided their own opinion that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is in a big city and has started heckling cat-callers by \"booo\"ing them. They mention that they do this to make the cat-caller uncomfortable, hoping to discourage the behavior and create a culture where others tell off cat-callers. However, they've received negative reactions from both men and women. Men think they're a \"white knight\" who's inviting trouble, and women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author acknowledges the possibility of being an asshole and is seeking advice.\n\nThe key points here are the intent versus the impact. The author's intention is to stop catcalling, which is a positive goal. But the method involves public shaming or mockery. The question is whether this method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, catcalling is a form of harassment, and bystander intervention is encouraged. However, the approach here is confrontational and public. While the author isn't engaging in physical confrontation, they're escalating the situation by drawing attention. The cat-caller might feel humiliated, which could lead to further aggression. The author mentions that they get threats but haven't been physically harmed yet. However, the potential for escalation exists.\n\nWomen's perspective is important here. They might feel that drawing attention to the situation could make them more vulnerable. If the cat-caller is angry or threatened, the woman being catcalled might face more danger. The author's action might not actually help the victim but instead put them at higher risk.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does mocking the cat-caller actually stop the behavior? It might if it's an isolated incident, but if it leads to more confrontation, it might not. The author's rationale is to create a culture where others speak up, but their method is individualistic and might not foster the community change they hope for.\n\nAlso, the author's own admission that they could be an asshole shows self-awareness, which is a point in their favor. However, self-awareness doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior if it's harmful.\n\nIn some contexts, public shaming is seen as a form of justice, but in situations involving harassment, it's a gray area. The author's approach is a form of intervention, but it's not the only way. There are other methods that don't involve confrontation, like reporting to authorities or supporting the victim discreetly.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions might not be the most effective or safe way to address catcalling. While their intention is good, the method could be counterproductive. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), as their actions could harm the very people they aim to protect and might escalate dangerous situations.\n"
