Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They provided the full text of the AITA question and their own opinion that the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I should analyze the situation. The author is catcalling other catcallers, making it uncomfortable for them in public. They do it in a big city, which is a public space. The main issue here is whether this form of public heckling is justified or if it's crossing a line.\n\nThe author's rationale is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable and encouraging others to intervene. They also mention that people around them think they're an asshole. So there's a conflict between their intention and others' perceptions.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Intervening in public harassment is generally seen as a positive, but the method might matter. Catcalling is inappropriate and disrespectful, so the author is trying to address that. However, using a \"boo\" like a silent movie villain could be seen as mocking or adding to the public humiliation. Maybe the author's approach is more about personal satisfaction or humor, which could backfire by escalating tensions. The cat-caller might react more aggressively, and the author's loud response might draw unwanted attention or escalate the situation.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that they get cussed at or threatened. While they feel physically capable of handling it, the response could lead to more conflict. The question is whether the means justify the ends. If the goal is to stop the behavior, is public shaming an effective method? Some might argue that it's a form of standing up against harassment, but others might say it's not the best approach because it could make things worse for the person being harassed if the cat-caller retaliates.\n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. Some experts say that direct confrontation can be risky but can also be effective if done safely. The author's method is indirect, using public shaming. However, it's unclear if this method is effective. Also, the author's own admission that others think they're an asshole suggests that their approach might not be universally respected or effective.\n\nIn terms of personal responsibility, the author is taking initiative, which is commendable. However, the method might not be the most constructive. If the goal is to create a culture where people intervene, maybe a different approach, like a calm and direct intervention, would be better. The author's method could be seen as provocative and potentially harmful if it leads to a more hostile environment.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions are well-intentioned but might be counterproductive. They are trying to do good but using a method that could escalate situations and is perceived negatively by others. So, I think the author is in the wrong because their approach might not be effective and could make things worse, even though their intentions are good.\n"
