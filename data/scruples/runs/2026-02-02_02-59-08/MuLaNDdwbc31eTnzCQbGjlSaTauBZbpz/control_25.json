Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author moved to a big city and started this habit two months ago. Their motivation is to combat catcalling by making the cat-callers uncomfortable, hoping to discourage the behavior. They use a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to curses or threats but no physical confrontations yet. \n\nPeople around them have mixed reactions. Men think he's a \"white knight\" (which might imply he's overstepping or being naive), while women think he's drawing unwanted attention and making things worse. The author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable could deter future incidents. They also find it funny, which adds a personal element.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the effectiveness and appropriateness of the method. Catcalling is a serious issue, and bystander intervention can be positive. However, the approach here is public heckling, which might escalate the situation. The threats received show that it's not being well-received by the offenders. Women's concerns about drawing attention are valid because it could put the targeted person in a worse position. \n\nBut the author's intention is good\u2014trying to create a more respectful environment. However, the method might not be the best. Instead of public shaming, maybe a more direct approach like confronting the cat-caller privately or supporting the person being harassed would be better. The humor and the \"white knight\" perception might undermine the seriousness of the issue.\n\nSo, the author's actions are well-intentioned but possibly counterproductive. They might be causing more harm than good by escalating tensions and not addressing the root issue effectively. Therefore, the answer would lean towards 'A' (the author is in the wrong) because their method, while trying to help, has negative side effects and doesn't consider the perspectives of those affected.\n"
