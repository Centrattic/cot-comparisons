Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has started loudly making a \"booo\" sound at cat-callers, which has led to some backlash from both men and women. The author's reasoning is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. But others think they're causing more attention or being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which could be seen as a positive. But on the other hand, their method involves public confrontation, which might escalate the situation. \n\nThe author mentions that people think they're being an asshole. Some men think they're being a \"white knight,\" which suggests they might be seen as overstepping. Women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. So, there's a conflict between the author's intention and others' perceptions.\n\nIs it the author's responsibility to not escalate? By making a scene, maybe they're not helping the victim, who might prefer not to be the center of attention. Also, the cat-caller might become more aggressive if confronted publicly, even if it's just heckling. The author might be putting others at risk by drawing attention. \n\nBut then again, cat-calling is a pervasive issue, and some people might support efforts to deter it. The author isn't physically confronting them, just making a loud noise. Maybe that's a form of non-violent protest. However, the effectiveness is questionable. If it's causing more threats and hostility, maybe it's counterproductive. \n\nAlso, the author is using humor, which could be a way to deflect tension, but maybe not the best approach. The question is whether the method is appropriate. The author isn't asking if it's effective, but if they're in the wrong. \n\nLegal perspective: In some places, cat-calling is protected under free speech unless it's targeted and threatening. But the author's heckling is their own form of expression. However, if it's disrupting public order, there could be issues. But I think legally, it's more about if the author's actions are also protected. \n\nMorally, the author is trying to do something good, but maybe the approach is flawed. The answer might depend on whether the method is appropriate even with good intentions. If the author's method is causing more harm than good, like escalating the situation, then they could be in the wrong. But if it's seen as a valid form of protest, then not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the dilemma is between the intent vs. the impact. The author's intent is to stop harassment, but the impact might be making it worse. The question is whether the method justifies the intent. If the method is causing more problems than solving, then the author is in the wrong. But if it's a reasonable way to address it, then not. \n\nSince the community's response is mixed but leaning towards the author being an asshole, maybe the answer is A. But also, the author is trying to address a real issue. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is causing more harm (even if unintended), they might be in the wrong. So, the answer could be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
