Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author moved to a big city and started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers to make them uncomfortable. They've been doing this for two months. The rationale is to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the offenders and maybe encourage others to stop it. However, people around think they're an asshole. Men say they're a white knight who might get beaten up, and women think they're drawing attention and making things worse. The author is conflicted but wants to know if they're an asshole.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But their method is to heckle them, which can escalate the situation. The author acknowledges that this might draw more attention, which could make the situation worse for the victim. Also, some people think the author is being an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the intent is good\u2014trying to stop harassment. On the other hand, the method might not be effective. If the author is making a scene, it could potentially put themselves or others at risk. Also, the author is using humor (\"if I can make the experience uncomfortable\") which some might see as dismissive of the serious issue.\n\nThe women's perspective here is important. If the author's actions are making the situation worse for the victims, that's a problem. Even if the intention is good, the outcome might be counterproductive. Public confrontation might escalate the conflict rather than de-escalate it. Also, the author is in a position of physical strength, which might make them feel emboldened, but others might not be in that position.\n\nIn some contexts, public shaming can be a form of intervention, but it's tricky. It's possible that the author's approach is not the best way to address the issue. Maybe a better approach would be to support the victims discreetly or report the incidents to authorities. The author's method might be seen as taking the attention away from the victim and putting it on themselves, which isn't helpful.\n\nHowever, the alternative is doing nothing, which also has its issues. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to address a problem, but their method is controversial. The key is whether their actions are causing more harm than good.\n\nThe fact that people around them (both men and women) think they're an asshole suggests that their approach isn't well-received. Women thinking it draws attention and makes things worse is a concern. So even though the intent is good, the method is problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their actions aren't effective and could be making the situation worse for the victims.\n"
