Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who's heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that they're in a big city for two months, and they started this habit of loudly \"booo\"ing the cat-callers, like a silent movie villain. The author mentions that this has led to some cussing and threats, but no actual violence. People around them think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. But they're also finding it funny, which adds a layer of hypocrisy, as they mentioned being a hypocrite for having that pet peeve yet acting this way.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. Public shaming, though, can be a contentious method. While the intent is good\u2014to stop harassment\u2014the method might be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stand up against harassment, which is a positive intention. They want to create an environment where such behavior isn't tolerated. However, their method of loudly heckling could be seen as escalating the situation. The cat-caller might feel publicly embarrassed, which could make the situation more confrontational. Plus, the author is putting themselves in a position where they might be targeted. They mention that people think they're an asshole, so maybe their approach isn't effective or appropriate.\n\nThe author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage them. However, public shaming can sometimes lead to defensiveness or aggression rather than reflection. Also, the author's own admission of finding it funny introduces a personal enjoyment aspect that might not align with genuine concern for stopping harassment. This could undermine their credibility and intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, bystander intervention is important in preventing harassment. The author is attempting to be a bystander, which is commendable. But the method of intervention could be counterproductive. There's a difference between direct intervention (like telling the cat-caller to stop) and public shaming. The \"booo\" method might not be the most effective or safest approach.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless the heckling leads to physical altercations or incites violence, the author isn't breaking the law. However, the social and ethical implications are more nuanced. It's a matter of whether the ends justify the means. Even if the intent is good, the method might be causing more harm than good by drawing attention to the harassment rather than de-escalating it.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they are a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they can handle threats. But it's still risky. Encouraging others to follow this method could lead to unsafe situations. Women's opinions that it draws attention and makes things worse are valid because sometimes, in situations of harassment, drawing more attention can put the victim in a more uncomfortable position.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention is to combat harassment, the method they're using might be counterproductive and could be seen as inconsiderate or even contributing to a hostile environment. The public shaming aspect and personal enjoyment of the situation might lead others to view them as an asshole. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using this approach, even if their intentions are good.\n"
