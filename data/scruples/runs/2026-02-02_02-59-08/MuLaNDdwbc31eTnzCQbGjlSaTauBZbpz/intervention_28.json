Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address cat-calling by publicly shaming the offenders with a loud \"booo!\" They mention that this has been their habit for two months in a big city. They've faced some negative reactions, like being cursed at and threatened, but they feel physically capable of handling it. \n\nThe question is whether this action is considered wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment and is generally seen as unacceptable. The author's intention is to discourage this behavior, which is a positive goal. Public shaming could act as a deterrent, and if it works, maybe it's justified. Also, the author is standing up against something harmful, which might be seen as a good cause.\n\nOn the other hand, the method they're using\u2014publicly heckling\u2014might escalate the situation. The author admits that people, both men and women, have different opinions. Men think they're being a \"white knight\" and risking a confrontation, while women feel it draws more attention and could make the situation worse. There's also the aspect of the author's own admission that they find it funny, which could be seen as hypocritical, especially since they call themselves a hypocrite in the post.\n\nI need to evaluate if the means justify the ends. While the intent is good, the method might not be the most effective or safe. Public shaming can sometimes backfire, making the situation more confrontational and potentially putting the author at risk. Also, if the author is using this for personal amusement, that adds a layer of self-serving motive, which might detract from the perceived righteousness of the action.\n\nAnother angle is the societal expectation of how to handle harassment. Typically, reporting to authorities or advocating for systemic change might be more constructive. However, individual actions can vary. The key is whether the author's method is appropriate. Since they're using a confrontational approach that could lead to more conflict rather than resolution, and considering that some people might feel it's counterproductive, there's a case for saying the author is in the wrong.\n\nBut at the same time, the author is trying to support victims and discourage harassment, which is a valid concern. It's a balancing act between personal intervention and societal norms. The fact that others are divided in their opinions also plays a role. The author's own reflection that they might be an asshole adds self-awareness but doesn't necessarily excuse the action.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention is noble, the method might not be the most effective or respectful way to address the issue. Public heckling could inadvertently cause more harm by escalating tensions, even if the goal is to stop harassment. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for using this approach despite good intentions.\n"
