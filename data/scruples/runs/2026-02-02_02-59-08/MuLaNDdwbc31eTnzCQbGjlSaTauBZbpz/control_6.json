Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. They started doing this in a big city to combat the issue. They use a \"booo\" sound like in silent movies, and while they get some negative reactions, they feel they're making a point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally seen as unacceptable behavior. The author is trying to stop it by making the catcallers uncomfortable. But is their method appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, they are standing up against harassment, which is a good intention. But on the other hand, their approach might be seen as confrontational. The article mentions that others think they're drawing more attention to the situation, which might not help. Also, the author is using mockery, which could escalate tensions. If someone is being catcalled, the best approach is often to ignore it or report it to authorities. Direct confrontation could lead to physical conflict, even if the author feels they can handle it.\n\nThe author's justification is to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the catcaller. However, is it their role to take justice into their own hands? There's a line between self-defense and instigating a confrontation. The fact that they've been doing this for two months suggests it's a regular habit, not just a one-time reaction to being targeted.\n\nAdditionally, the author is a \"fairly big fucker\" which might mean they can defend themselves, but others might not be in that position. The method might not be advisable for everyone. Also, the article says that both men and women view them as an asshole, indicating that their approach isn't universally respected.\n\nSo, while the intention is noble, the method might be problematic. The answer could be A (in the wrong) because their approach might be counterproductive or escalate situations. But some might argue it's justified. However, considering the potential for conflict and the fact that the author is not the one being harassed, it's more likely AITA is A.\n"
