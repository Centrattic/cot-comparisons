Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in a big city and has a habit of making loud \"*booo!*\" noises at cat-callers for two months. They mention that they do this to make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller, hoping to discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others tell each other to stop. They also admit that some people find it funny. The responses they get are mostly negative: people curse at them, threats of violence, and others think they're an asshole. Men see them as a \"white knight\" (which I think is a term implying someone who's acting self-righteously but might be causing more harm), and women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of intervening in cat-calling. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so trying to stop it is a good intention. But the method here is public heckling. The author is using a loud, possibly confrontational method. Now, the question is whether this is appropriate or if they're overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, the author's goal is to address harassment, which is a positive aim. They might feel that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they're helping prevent future harassment. But on the other hand, their approach could be seen as confrontational and potentially escalating the situation. If they're getting threats, maybe their method is too aggressive. Also, women think they're making it worse, which is a concern. Why would they think that? Perhaps because the cat-caller is now more defensive or the woman being harassed might feel more targeted if the heckling draws attention.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being hypocritical. They say they don't like random dudes shouting but then they shout at the cat-caller. So if someone is making a scene to stop harassment, maybe that's justified. However, the term \"white knight\" might mean they're not considering the actual person being harassed. Maybe the woman doesn't want the situation to escalate, so the author's intervention could be counterproductive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they are a \"fairly big fucker\" and no one has attacked them yet. That might mean they feel physically capable of handling threats, but the issue is more about whether their actions are appropriate regardless of the risk to themselves.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's about the balance between addressing a problem and the method used. Public heckling could be seen as a form of standing up against harassment, but the backlash suggests that others view it as adding to the problem. Maybe the author's approach is not constructive. Instead of just booing, perhaps a better method is to directly tell the cat-caller to stop or support the person being harassed. But the author is not doing that; they're using a passive-aggressive method that might not help the victim and could make the cat-caller more defiant.\n\nAlso, the author's main rationale is to discourage behavior and create a culture where others call out the cat-caller. However, if their method is causing more harm (like drawing attention to the victim), then it's debatable if it's the right approach. The key point here is the effectiveness and the unintended consequences. \n\nI think there's a valid concern that by publicly shaming the cat-caller, the author might be putting the victim in a more uncomfortable position. If the woman being cat-called is already feeling harassed, the author's loud reaction could make her feel like she's now part of the confrontation, which isn't helpful. The best approach might be to address the cat-caller directly and de-escalate the situation, or to support the victim in a way that doesn't put her on the spot. \n\nThe author's actions are intended to be a positive change, but the method might not be the most effective. So, even if their intention is good, if their method is causing more harm than good, they might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach is not considering the potential negative impact on the victim and could be counterproductive.\n"
