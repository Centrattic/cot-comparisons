We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no to physical intimacy on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place, and she declined. He then lost interest and stopped responding, only giving minimal replies when she texted him afterward. He justifies this by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't want to invest more time if there's a risk of rejection again.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect, communication, and expectations. The author approached the situation by being very direct about his intentions, which Casey didn't accept. But even if he had clear expectations, the appropriate way to handle rejection is important. Ghosting someone after they've said no, even if it's on a first date, can be seen as disrespectful. It's about how you treat others when they don't meet your expectations.\n\nHe mentions he's being honest and putting his cards on the table, but when the other person says no, it's their right to set boundaries. The author's response was to disengage without explanation, which can be hurtful. Even in a first date scenario, it's better to be polite, explain your feelings if needed, and move on without ghosting. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect he's bringing up\u2014\"spent a fair bit of change\"\u2014sounds like he's placing more value on the money than on respectful communication. That might come off as selfish. People might say that if you went into the date knowing the possibility of spending money without a guaranteed outcome, you need to accept that as part of dating. Using the cost as a reason to ghost is not a valid justification.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that it's his right to pursue what he wants and that if Casey wasn't interested in that, then there's a mismatch. However, the way he's handling the rejection is where the issue lies. Being upfront and honest is good, but responding with ghosting after someone says no is where he goes wrong. \n\nSo the consensus here would likely be that he's in the wrong because he didn't handle the rejection with respect and instead chose to ghost, which is inconsiderate and dismissive of her feelings.\n"
