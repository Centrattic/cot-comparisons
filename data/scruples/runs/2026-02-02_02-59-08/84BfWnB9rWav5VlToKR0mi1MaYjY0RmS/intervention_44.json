We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting after the other person didn't agree to have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author set up a date with Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around\" during the date. She said no and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ghosting her.\n\nI should consider social norms around dating and communication. When someone declines a request for physical intimacy, especially on a first date, the appropriate response is to respect their boundaries. Ghosting, which is cutting off all communication without explanation, is generally seen as inconsiderate. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations, but that doesn't excuse the lack of communication.\n\nAlso, the fact that he mentioned thinking about the money spent on the date might indicate that his initial interest was more about getting something in return rather than genuine connection. This could be a red flag about his intentions. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial, and walking away without closure can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, he might argue that he was honest about his intentions upfront, so the rejection was mutual. However, even if he was honest, she was clear that she wasn't interested in that step yet. The issue here is his reaction to her refusal. Ghosting doesn't give her a chance to understand his feelings or respond, which is why many people would consider that inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is being inconsiderate by not communicating his feelings properly and respecting her decision by cutting off contact abruptly. Therefore, he's likely the asshole here.\n"
