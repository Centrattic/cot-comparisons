We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that they went on a first date, he asked to fool around, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author approached the girl, asked directly to go back to his place, she politely declined, and he felt disappointed, thinking he had a \"done deal.\" Then he just stopped communicating, not even acknowledging her texts. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nConsidering consent and respect, the girl said no, so the author shouldn't have pressured her. But the issue here is his reaction. Ghosting after a rejection is generally seen as inconsiderate. Even if he felt disinterested, the right approach would be to have an honest conversation rather than cutting off communication abruptly. The fact that he mentions the money spent on the date and the risk of another date without the same outcome shows his self-centered perspective. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should feel respected. The girl wanted to take things slower, which is her right. The author's decision to ghost because she didn't meet his expectations is dismissive of her boundaries. So, even though he's honest about his feelings, his actions are hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
