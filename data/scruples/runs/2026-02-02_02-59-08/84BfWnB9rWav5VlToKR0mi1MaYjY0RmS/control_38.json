We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no. He thought she had a crush on him, so he expected an easy yes. When she declined, he lost interest and stopped communicating, hence ghosting her. He mentions spending money on the date and feeling like it wasn't worth it.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the person is upset about the rejection, cutting off communication abruptly isn't respectful. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest, but that's his own feeling, and he's choosing to ghost her instead of being honest about his feelings.\n\nCasey said she likes him and wants to take things slower. The author's response was to disengage, which could be hurtful. People have different boundaries, and respecting someone's decision is important. The fact that he's using the excuse of not wanting to spend more money or risk another rejection doesn't justify ghosting. He should have communicated his feelings directly if he was no longer interested.\n\nAlso, the initial approach of asking for sex on the first date might be seen as forward, but it's his choice. However, the problem arises after the rejection when he doesn't communicate. The key issue here is the lack of communication and the decision to ghost, which is typically considered rude and inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the rejection maturely. He should have either been honest about his expectations or not pursued a relationship if her boundaries didn't align with his. Ghosting is a disrespectful way to handle the situation.\n"
