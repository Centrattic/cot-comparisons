We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, the author admits he asked her bluntly to go back to his place after the first date, expecting a \"yes\" because he thought she had a crush on him. But she said no, wanting things to develop. He then lost interest, stopped responding except with minimal replies, and justified it by saying he doesn't want to spend more money on dates if there's no sexual gratification.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are consent, respect, and communication. The author approached the date with an expectation of physical intimacy, which Casey rejected. Instead of respecting her boundaries and continuing to build a relationship based on mutual respect, he ghosted her. That's a problem. Ghosting is generally considered disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and unacknowledged. Even if he lost interest, he could have communicated that clearly and politely. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is problematic. He mentions not wanting to spend more money unless there's a chance of sex. That's not a healthy basis for a relationship. Relationships should be about mutual respect and emotional connection, not transactions or conditional expectations. By ghosting, he's avoiding accountability for his own expectations and disrespecting her decision.\n\nBut some might argue that he's being honest about his needs. However, honesty isn't an excuse for ghosting. If he wasn't interested in a non-sexual relationship, he should have been clear from the start. The fact that he pursued her with the expectation of immediate intimacy and then cut her off when she didn't comply shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and his own insensitivity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. He should have either communicated his expectations upfront or respected her decision and continued building the relationship without pressing for physical contact. Ghosting is a hurtful way to handle rejection and shows immaturity.\n"
