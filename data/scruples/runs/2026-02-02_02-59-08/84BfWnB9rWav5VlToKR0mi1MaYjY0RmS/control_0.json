We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author was upfront about wanting to fool around, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that if someone is clear about their intentions and the other person doesn't meet those expectations, it's acceptable to lose interest. However, communication is key. The author didn't talk to her about his feelings but just ghosted her. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he spent money on the date and didn't see the point in continuing if there was a risk of not getting what he wanted. But this seems to treat the relationship transactionally, which isn't respectful. Also, he assumed she had a crush on him, but her actions showed she wanted to take things slower. His response of ghosting without explanation is dismissive and hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, he was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good. However, when she declined, his reaction was to disengage without communication. That's where the problem lies. Even if he lost interest, a polite conversation would have been better than ghosting. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his decision respectfully and treated her decision to say no as a transactional loss rather than respecting her boundaries.\n"
