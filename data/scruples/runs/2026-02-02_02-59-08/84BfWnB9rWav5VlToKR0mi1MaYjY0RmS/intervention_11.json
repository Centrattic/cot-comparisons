We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting after the woman didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The man asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place after their first date, which included a movie and dinner. She said no and said things should develop further. He then lost interest and started ignoring her texts, only responding with thumbs up or \"k\". He mentions he spent a lot of money and was disappointed.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to ghost someone because they didn't have sex on the first date. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the woman made it clear she wanted to take things slowly, which is her right. Everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels. The man's approach was to be honest, but his reaction seems to treat her decision as a failure or rejection. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person hanging without explanation.\n\nOn the other hand, the man might feel that since he was upfront about his intentions, her refusal changed his perception. However, that doesn't justify ghosting. Even if he lost interest, a respectful response would be to explain his feelings instead of cutting her off abruptly. The fact that he's using the money as a justification might show a transactional view, which isn't healthy.\n\nAlso, considering the time they've known each other, 8 months of knowing her and 2 months of flirting. She had a crush for 5-6 months. Maybe there was a misunderstanding in expectations. The man expected physical intimacy early on, but she wanted to build a connection first. His reaction shows a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the man's actions are dismissive and disrespectful. Ghosting is considered inconsiderate, and using someone's refusal to sleep with him as a reason to cut off communication is a sign of poor emotional intelligence. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
