We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author mentions he asked openly, and she said no, then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nHmm, first, the situation involves respect for consent. The author approached her directly, and she clearly said no. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if someone is interested in a relationship, they need to honor the other person's decisions. The fact that he tried to get physical on the first date might not be appropriate. It's possible he misread her signals, thinking she was more interested in a physical relationship when she wasn't ready.\n\nThen, after she declined, he ghosted her. Ghosting can be hurtful, regardless of the reason. Even if he felt rejected, cutting off communication without explanation is considered rude. She tried to reach out afterward, but he ignored her. That shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. The author's justification is that he lost interest, but that doesn't excuse ghosting. People have the right to their preferences, but how they handle rejections matters.\n\nAlso, the part about the money spent on the date seems to imply he's using financial investment as a reason for his reaction. However, respecting someone's autonomy should take precedence over financial loss. It's not fair to pressure someone into a physical relationship just to recoup costs. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, there's a common expectation that people should communicate their needs and set boundaries. If the author wants a relationship where physical intimacy is important, he should have been clear from the start. But once someone declines, moving on gracefully is better than ghosting. The author's approach might come off as selfish and disrespectful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is using the rejection as a reason to ghost, which is hurtful. Respecting consent and handling rejection with empathy is key here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
