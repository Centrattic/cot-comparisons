We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't sleep with him on the first date. The question is whether that's acceptable or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author set up a date, asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which she declined. He felt awkward and lost interest, leading him to ghost her. He mentions he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost all interest because she didn't give him what he wanted.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. From a relationship etiquette perspective, ghosting is generally considered rude. People might argue that if he wasn't interested in continuing a relationship because she had different boundaries, he should have been honest and communicated that respectfully rather than cutting off contact abruptly.\n\nHowever, others might say that if someone's only interested in a physical relationship and isn't willing to pursue an emotional connection, then the author isn't wrong for moving on. But the key here is that he didn't communicate his feelings clearly. He just stopped responding, which can leave the other person confused and hurt. She did reach out multiple times, showing she wanted to reconnect, but he didn't respond properly.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on his own expectations and what he considers a \"fair exchange\" (spending money on the date expecting physical intimacy). That's problematic because it suggests he was only interested in a transactional relationship. Respecting someone's boundaries is important, but if he wasn't interested in a relationship where those boundaries are in place, maybe he should have considered that before asking her out.\n\nSo, the problem is that he didn't communicate his feelings. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate. Even if he lost interest, he should have told her clearly and politely. Not responding to her texts and just giving minimal replies is still ghosting. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation respectfully and left her hanging without an explanation.\n"
