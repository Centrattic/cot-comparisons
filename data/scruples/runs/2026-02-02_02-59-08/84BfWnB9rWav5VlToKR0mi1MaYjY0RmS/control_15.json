We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for longer. They went on a date, and he asked her to go back to his place. She said no, wanting to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving short replies. He justifies this by saying he didn't want to waste money or time if she wasn't going to be sexual.\n\nSo, the key points are: he expected a certain outcome (sex on the first date), felt it was a deal, and when she said no, he shut down. Ghosting is generally considered poor behavior because it's dismissive and hurtful. Even if someone feels disappointed, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not interested anymore because she didn't meet his expectations. But expecting sex on the first date isn't something everyone is comfortable with. Casey wanted to take it slower, which is a valid choice. The author's reaction of ghosting, however, is problematic because it's not respecting her decision and is being cruel by ignoring her attempts to communicate.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions is a bit self-centered. While money was spent, treating a date shouldn't be a transactional exchange. If he wasn't open to a non-sexual relationship, maybe he shouldn't have pursued it. His actions now are dismissive and don't show consideration for her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. He chose to ghost someone who wasn't meeting his immediate sexual expectations, which is not a valid reason to cut someone off so abruptly. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
