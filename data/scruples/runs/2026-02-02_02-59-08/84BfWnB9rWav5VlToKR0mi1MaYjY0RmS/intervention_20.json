We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The person is called out for being an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, asked her if they could fool around, and she said no. He then lost interest and has been ghosting her. He mentions that he spent money on the date and is upset about it. He's not responding to her texts, just giving minimal replies.\n\nSo, the key points here are: He was honest about wanting to have sex upfront. She said no and wanted to take things slower. He felt it was an \"easy sell\" because of rumors of her having feelings for him. After the date, he stopped engaging, which is considered ghosting. \n\nNow, considering social norms, it's generally expected that people respect boundaries. If he asked and she said no, his immediate loss of interest and ghosting could be seen as disrespectful. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent might indicate that his interest was more about his own expectations than her feelings. \n\nGhosting is typically frowned upon because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if he's not interested anymore, cutting off communication abruptly is considered inconsiderate. The author is using \"not wanting to waste more money\" as a justification, which shows a self-centered view. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's not in the wrong because he's honest about his preferences. If he's only interested in a partner who is willing to engage sexually early on, maybe it's his right to disengage. But the problem is that he didn't respect her decision and then left her hanging, which is the ghosting part. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if he's not interested anymore, he should have communicated that to Casey instead of ignoring her. His actions have caused emotional distress, which is why many would side that he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation respectfully, ghosted her, and prioritized his own disappointment over her feelings.\n"
