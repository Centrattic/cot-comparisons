We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The original question is in the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) format, so the context is a relationship scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the story. The author had known Casey for 8 months, with flirting for 2 months and rumors of a crush for 5-6 months. They went on a first date where he asked to go back to his place, which she refused, saying she wanted things to develop. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now she's texting him, but he's ghosting her. He justifies it by saying he spent money and lost interest because she didn't \"put out.\"\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about respect and communication. The author's behavior is ghosting, which is generally considered inconsiderate because he cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, abruptly disappearing can be hurtful. Ghosting is often seen as the asshole move because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nAlso, the premise that he expected sex on the first date might be problematic. Expecting someone to have sex on the first date can be unrealistic and may show a lack of respect for her boundaries. She made it clear she wanted to take things slower, and instead of respecting that, he decided to ghost her. That suggests he wasn't committed to building a relationship regardless of sexual activity.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. He mentions spending money on the date, which seems to be a reason for his frustration. However, the cost shouldn't be the primary factor in whether a relationship is worth pursuing. Healthy relationships aren't about getting something in return, like sex, especially not so quickly.\n\nHe also says he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions still cause hurt. Even if he's honest, the way he's handling the situation lacks consideration. The fact that he's responding with minimal texts (\"thumbs up\" or \"k\") instead of a proper conversation shows he's avoiding communication, which is a classic ghosting tactic.\n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often emphasizes mutual respect and communication. The author's actions don't meet those standards. He didn't explain his feelings or give her a chance to respond. Instead, he cut her off, which is why many would say he's in the wrong. The key here is that his reaction was extreme and disrespectful, even if he felt let down.\n"
