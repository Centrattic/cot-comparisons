We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after the first date because she didn't agree to have sex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months and there were rumors she had a crush on him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, which was dinner and a movie. The author was direct and asked if she wanted to go back to his place to fool around. She said no, but mentioned she liked him and wanted things to develop further. Then the author lost interest and started ghosting her, only giving minimal responses to her texts. He's justifying it by saying he doesn't want to spend more money on dates if there's a risk of not getting any physical relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's cutting off communication without explanation. The author didn't even give a reason for suddenly disengaging. Even if he had no interest anymore, the proper approach would be to tell her politely. Instead, he's just ignoring her texts and giving one-word replies. That's not respectful to her, especially since she indicated she wanted to continue the relationship and see her on a second date.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he's ghosting because she didn't sleep with him on the first date. That's a common issue in these AITA questions. Society often frowns upon valuing physical intimacy over someone's boundaries. She said no, and he's using that as a reason to end all contact, which is dismissive of her autonomy and decisions. People in relationships or dating should respect each other's boundaries, even if they're not met immediately. \n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. He mentions he spent a lot of money and doesn't want to waste it again. While it's understandable to have expectations, the value of a date shouldn't be measured solely by financial cost or the possibility of physical relations. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and connection, not transactional views.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings, which is a good point. He didn't pretend to be interested when he wasn't. However, honesty still needs to be paired with respect. Ghosting is the dishonest part here because he's not communicating his lack of interest. He's expected to be honest, but in a way that's considerate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because he ghosted her without explanation, prioritized his own expectations over her feelings, and treated the date as a transaction where her refusal led to him cutting her off. Even if he lost interest, he should have communicated that instead of disappearing. The correct answer is A.\n"
