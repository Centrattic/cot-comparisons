We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't put out on the first date. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked Casey to go back to his place to fool around after their first date, but she said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest and hasn't replied to her texts, effectively ghosting her. He mentions he spent money on the date and feels like he wasted it, which is why he's cutting her off.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's actions: being forward about wanting to have sex on the first date, then losing interest when she said no. Ghosting someone after rejecting their advances is generally seen as inconsiderate. Communication is important in any interaction, and cutting someone off without explanation can be hurtful. \n\nFrom a social perspective, people have different boundaries and timelines for physical intimacy. Casey wanted to take things slower, which is a valid choice. The author's response to her refusal by ghosting might be seen as disrespectful because he didn't engage in further conversation or respect her decision. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is clear: he wanted a sexual encounter and when that wasn't possible, he lost interest. This could imply that his main interest was in the physical aspect rather than building a relationship. Ghosting is often considered a cowardly way to end contact, as it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has the right to pursue what he wants and if it's not mutual, he's under no obligation to continue. However, the way he handled the rejection by completely cutting her off without explanation is the issue here. \n\nConsidering all this, the consensus would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she rejected his advances, as it's a form of disrespectful communication and disregard for her feelings.\n"
