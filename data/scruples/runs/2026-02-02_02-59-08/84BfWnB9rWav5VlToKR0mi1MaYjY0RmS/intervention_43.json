We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a girl after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author explains that they had been flirting for a couple of months, had a first date where he asked her to go back to his place, which she declined, and then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nHmm, so I need to evaluate if his actions are justified. The key points here are about consent, respect, and communication. The author approached the girl and asked directly if she wanted to have sex, and she said no. Then he ghosted her. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he felt disappointed, not replying to her messages and ending the interaction abruptly is inconsiderate. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations for the first date, but that's his problem, not hers. Everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels. The girl wanted to take things slower, which is a valid choice. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the money spent on the date, implying that he felt it was a waste. That's a bit selfish because the purpose of a date isn't just about getting something in return. The girl's decision to say no doesn't make her at fault. \n\nIn terms of communication, the author didn't have a conversation to express his feelings or set boundaries. Instead, he just stopped responding, which is a passive-aggressive way to handle things. If he wasn't interested in continuing the relationship because of her decision to wait, he should have been honest but respectful in his communication. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and handled the situation by ghosting, which is hurtful and disrespectful. The answer should be A.\n"
