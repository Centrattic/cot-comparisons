We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. He thought she had a crush on him for months, so he was expecting a yes. Now he's ghosting her because she didn't sleep with him on the first date, and he cites lost interest and the money spent on the date as reasons.\n\nFirst, the issue is honesty and communication. He asked her bluntly if she wanted to fool around, and she said no. That's her right. She set a boundary. But the author then decided to ghost her because she didn't meet his expectations. That seems problematic because her decision doesn't make her wrong. People have different comfort levels and boundaries, and respecting that is part of being considerate.\n\nThen there's the part about the money. He's upset about the money spent because he expected a certain outcome. But that's his problem, not hers. If you go on a date and spend money, you can't expect to get something in return, especially if the person isn't ready for that. It's not fair to hold that against them.\n\nHe claims he's not trying to hurt her, but the action of ghosting can be hurtful. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. Even if he's not interested anymore, a respectful response would be to explain his feelings and move on, rather than just disappearing.\n\nAnother point is his reaction to her attempts to reach out. He's only responding with minimal replies, which is dismissive. It's not fair to make her chase after him when he's lost interest. Open communication would be better here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him. That's a red flag. If his interest was conditional on her meeting his expectations for physical intimacy on the first date, then he might not have had genuine interest in the relationship. That's a bit shallow and not a healthy basis for a connection.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundaries, he's holding her accountable for his own expectations, he's being dismissive and ghosting, and he's prioritizing his own feelings over her comfort. The answer should be A.\n"
