We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, who had been flirting with him for a while and had rumors of having a crush. During dinner, he asked her to go back to his place, she declined and said they can see on the second date. He then lost interest, didn't respond well, and now is ghosting her because he doesn't want to invest more time or money without the possibility of sex.\n\nSo, the key points are: He made a big assumption that she was interested in a physical relationship, she set a boundary, he didn't respect her limits, and he's cutting her off because he's not getting what he wanted. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship ethics perspective, respecting someone's boundaries and consent is crucial. Even if he's honest about his intentions, pressuring someone for sex on the first date is not appropriate. And when she said no, his response was to stop engaging with her, which is ghosting\u2014this is considered rude and dismissive. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he was focused on the money spent, which indicates that he might have had ulterior motives or was using the date as a means to an end, which isn't respectful. The fact that he didn't take her feelings into account and just cut her off shows a lack of empathy. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's under no obligation to continue the relationship if his expectations weren't met. But the key here is that he didn't communicate his feelings properly. A better approach would be to have an open conversation rather than ghosting. \n\nSo, even if he's upset, the act of ghosting and not respecting her decision is where he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
