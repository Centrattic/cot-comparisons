We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. So, the author set up a date, asked if she wanted to go back to his place, she said no, and then he just stopped responding. He's justified it by saying he lost interest because she didn't \"put out\" and he spent money. \n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. In many cultures, people are expected to be respectful and communicative in relationships. Ghosting is generally seen as poor form because it leaves the other person confused and undervalued. The author didn't even respond to her texts, which shows a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nThen there's the issue of consent and boundaries. The author assumed that she would be okay with sexual activity on the first date because of the rumors and her supposed crush. But she clearly stated she wasn't comfortable, so moving on to a second date was her way of keeping things going while setting boundaries. The author, however, seems to have viewed her refusal as a personal failure or rejection, leading to his decision to ghost her. That's a problem because respecting someone's decision is crucial, regardless of personal disappointment.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author mentions spending money and feeling like it was wasted. This suggests he approached the date with an expectation of getting something in return (sexual activity), which is transactional and not healthy. Healthy relationships shouldn't be based on what each person gives or receives in terms of money or physical favors. \n\nCommunication is also key. Instead of cutting off contact, the author could have had an honest conversation about his expectations and why he was disappointed. Ghosting without explanation is a passive-aggressive way to handle the situation and shows a lack of maturity. \n\nThe author's reasoning that he's not trying to hurt her but just doesn't see the point is flawed. Dismissing someone because they didn't meet his expectations is still harmful. Everyone has different comfort levels and timelines, and it's important to respect that. The fact that he's responding with thumbs up or \"k\" indicates he's being dismissive rather than engaging in a respectful closure.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions\u2014ghosting, lack of communication, and valuing the interaction based on financial and sexual expectations\u2014show that he's not respecting Casey's boundaries and feelings. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
