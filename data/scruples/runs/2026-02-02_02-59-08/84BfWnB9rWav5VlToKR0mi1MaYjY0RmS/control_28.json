We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've known each other for 8 months, with flirting for 2 of those. There were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. They had their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author was direct and asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" but she said no, not tonight. She mentioned she wasn't like that and wanted things to develop on the second date. The author then zoned out during the rest of the date, focused on the money spent, and later ghosted her, responding minimally to her texts.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication, respect, and expectations. The author was honest about his intentions early on, which Casey didn't meet. He then lost interest because he thought he had a \"done deal\" and felt let down when she didn't comply. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for ghosting her.\n\nFrom Casey's perspective, she set boundaries and communicated that she wanted things to progress slowly. The author, however, seems to have expected a different outcome and then disengaged without addressing his feelings properly. Ghosting usually involves cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. Even if the author lost interest, a more respectful approach would be to explain that he's no longer interested instead of ignoring her.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the money spent, which might indicate he viewed the date as an investment for sexual activity, which is problematic. Healthy relationships shouldn't be transactional. She had the right to say no, and his reaction of ghosting shows a lack of respect for her decision.\n\nIn terms of social norms, pressuring someone for sex on a first date is not appropriate, and respecting her choice to wait is essential. The author's decision to ghost rather than communicate his disinterest properly makes him the asshole here. So the answer is A.\n"
