We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation properly. The author went on a first date with Casey, who he's known for 8 months and had been flirting with for 2 months. There were rumors she had a crush on him for longer. He asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" but she said no, not tonight. She said she wanted things to develop. He then lost interest, stopped talking to her, and ghosted her because he didn't want to invest more time/money without getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, relationships should be about mutual respect and consent. The author approached Casey with a clear expectation of physical intimacy, but she set a boundary. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. By ghosting her afterward, the author is dismissing her feelings and the relationship potential because she didn't meet his expectations. That's a problem because it shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and her decision to take things slower.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not interested anymore because she said no. That suggests his interest was conditional on getting physical, which isn't a healthy basis for a relationship. If someone's only interested in a relationship when there's an expectation of immediate physical intimacy, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships are built on more than just physical aspects; they involve emotional connection and mutual respect.\n\nAnother point is the financial aspect he brings up. He's upset about spending money on the date. That's a bit of a materialistic view. The cost of a date shouldn't be the reason for losing interest, especially if he was the one pushing for physical intimacy. If he's so focused on money and immediate gratification, it reflects a transactional attitude, which isn't respectful.\n\nHowever, people do have different levels of sexual interest and boundaries. The author might believe that since he was honest about his intentions, he's not at fault if she didn't meet them. But even in cases where someone is honest, respecting the other person's response is key. Ghosting after someone declines your advances can be hurtful and is generally considered inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while some might say that men are often taught to pursue and women to delay, the modern standard emphasizes mutual respect. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate because he didn't communicate his disappointment or give the relationship a chance to develop further. He just cut off communication, which is abrupt and doesn't allow for either party to express their feelings or clarify intentions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author didn't respect Casey's boundary, had a conditional interest, and ghosted her without explanation. These actions show a lack of respect and consideration, making him the asshole.\n"
