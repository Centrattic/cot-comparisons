We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author goes on a first date with Casey. They've been flirting for a while, and there were rumors she had feelings. During dinner, he asks if they can go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She says no, not tonight, and says she wants to let things develop. He then zones out, doesn't engage much, and after the date, he stops responding, only giving minimal replies when she texts. He justifies it by saying he lost interest because she didn't reciprocate his physical intentions, and he doesn't want to spend money on dates without getting what he wants.\n\nNow, the key points here. Ghosting someone after they say no to sex on the first date. Is that the author's fault? Well, respect for someone's boundaries is important. She clearly said no, and instead of respecting her decision, he lost interest and ghosted her. That seems problematic. Communication is key in relationships, and pressuring someone for sex after they decline isn't okay. Also, the fact that he mentions the money spent might indicate he was more focused on getting something out of the date rather than building a relationship. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that he's just being honest about his preferences. If he's only interested in a physical relationship and she's not, then maybe he's not the asshole. However, the way he approached it\u2014asking bluntly on the first date and then cutting her off after she said no\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. Also, ghosting is generally considered rude regardless of the reason. Even if he wasn't interested anymore, ending the conversation abruptly without explanation could hurt her feelings. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a social perspective, respecting someone's \"no\" is crucial. Even if you're disappointed, you shouldn't ghost someone. A better approach would be to have an open conversation about expectations. Since he didn't do that and instead cut her off, that might make him the asshole. Also, the fact that he mentions losing interest because he \"struck out\" suggests he was more focused on his own desires than her feelings. \n\nBut then again, maybe he's not the asshole if he's being honest about his wants. However, honesty doesn't excuse ghosting. People can have different expectations, but communication is needed. So, I think the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he ghosted her after she said no, which is disrespectful, and didn't communicate his feelings properly.\n"
