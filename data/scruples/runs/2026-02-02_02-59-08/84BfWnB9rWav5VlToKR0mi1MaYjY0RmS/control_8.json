We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author set up a date with Casey, they went to dinner, watched a movie. He asked her if they could go back to his place to fool around, and she said no, not tonight. She mentioned that she likes him and wants things to develop. But the author thought it was a done deal because there were rumors she had a crush on him for months. He then zoned out during dinner, thinking about how he struck out. After the date, he didn't respond much to her texts and just gave a limp hug. Now he's ghosting her because she didn't sleep with him on the first date, and he lost interest. He's justifying it by saying he doesn't see the point in spending more money if there's a risk of not getting any again.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting her. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, did he respect her decision? When she said no, he asked bluntly. Maybe he didn't handle the rejection well. Ghosting someone after a rejection could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful, especially if there was a crush involved. She said she liked him and wanted things to progress, so cutting off communication abruptly might be hurtful.\n\nHe mentions he's being honest, but honesty shouldn't be an excuse for not being respectful. If he lost all interest after one date, that's his prerogative, but the way he's handling it is ghosting. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. She's reaching out to him, and he's not even giving a proper response beyond a thumbs up or \"k\". That's not just losing interest; it's intentionally ignoring her attempts to communicate. \n\nAlso, he's focusing on the money spent. While that's a common complaint, it's not a valid reason for ghosting. If he's only interested in a relationship where there's immediate physical intimacy, that's his personal preference, but he can't blame the other person for not meeting those expectations. However, he should have considered that upfront. Maybe he didn't communicate his expectations properly, leading to a mismatch.\n\nHe says he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions are still hurtful. The fact that he lost interest immediately might mean he wasn't truly interested in building a relationship, just in getting physical. That's not the person's fault per se, but the way he's ending the interaction is the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Ghosting after a rejection, not responding to her texts, and acting dismissive are all behaviors that make him seem like the asshole. Even if he's not in the wrong for losing interest, the way he's handling it is definitely inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
