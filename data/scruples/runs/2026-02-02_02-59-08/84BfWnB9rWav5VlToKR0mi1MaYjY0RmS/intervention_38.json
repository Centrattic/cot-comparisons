We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had been flirting with Casey for a couple of months, and there were rumors she had a crush on him. They went on a first date, did dinner and a movie. The author then asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which she declined, saying they should wait until the second date. He thought he had a \"done deal\" because of her supposed crush, but she said no. He felt awkward, zoned out, and after the date, lost interest. He didn't respond to her texts, hence ghosting her. The author's reasoning is that since she didn't comply, he lost all interest and doesn't want to waste more money on another date. He's asking if he's the asshole for ghosting her.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts communication abruptly without explanation. But there's also the aspect of consent and respecting boundaries. The author pushed for physical intimacy on the first date, which might be too soon for some people. Casey set a boundary by saying no and suggested waiting until a second date. The author, instead of respecting her boundary and engaging in further conversation, decided to end all contact. That seems disrespectful. \n\nHe also mentions the money spent as a factor. Using someone's refusal to engage in physical activity on the first date as a reason to cut them off might indicate a transactional view of the relationship, which is problematic. The value of a person's autonomy and their right to set boundaries should outweigh any financial considerations. \n\nAdditionally, the author's approach was blunt and direct, which might have caught Casey off guard. While honesty is good, being too aggressive about physical expectations can pressure someone and lead to discomfort. Casey's response indicates she wanted to take things slower, and the author's reaction of losing all interest might show a lack of emotional investment beyond physical attraction. \n\nGhosting doesn't allow the other person to understand the situation or receive closure. Even if the author felt disappointed, a better approach would be to communicate openly, express his feelings, and decide if he's okay with taking things slower. By ghosting, he's avoiding responsibility for his actions and the discomfort of a difficult conversation. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions were disrespectful in multiple ways: pressuring for intimacy too quickly, dismissing her boundaries, using financial loss as a justification, and cutting off communication without explanation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
