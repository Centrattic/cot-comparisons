We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author set up a date with Casey, who had supposedly had a crush on him for months. During the date, he directly asked if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not that night, and suggested the second date. The author then lost interest and started ghosting her, not responding beyond minimal replies. He mentions losing interest because he spent money on the date and didn't get what he wanted.\n\nNow, thinking about whether he's in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's cutting off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, there's a social expectation to be respectful. The fact that he's using her refusal to have sex as the reason to ghost her might be problematic. It could be seen as treating her as a means to an end rather than valuing a relationship. Also, the mention of money being a factor might indicate he wasn't into her but more into getting what he wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his feelings. If he genuinely doesn't have interest anymore, some might say it's his right. But the way he's handling it\u2014ghosting\u2014is the issue. Also, pressuring someone into sex on the first date is a red flag. Even if she said no, the fact that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" shows he might not have respected her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually build relationships gradually. Expecting sex on the first date isn't realistic for many, and Casey's response suggests she wanted to take it slower. The author's reaction of losing interest and ghosting could be seen as immature or disrespectful. He's also focusing on the financial aspect, which might not be fair. Dates are supposed to be about getting to know each other, not a transactional exchange.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions\u2014ghosting after she said no and prioritizing his own desires over mutual respect\u2014likely make him the asshole. The answer is A.\n"
