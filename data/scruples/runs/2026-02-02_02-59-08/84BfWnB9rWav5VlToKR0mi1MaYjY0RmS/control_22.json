We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to engage in sexual activity on the first date. The scenario is presented through the author's own question on a platform like Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole?\" section.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both perspectives. The author had been flirting with Casey for two months and thought she had a crush on him for longer. They went on a first date where he directly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She declined, stating she wasn't that type and wanted things to develop further. The author then lost interest, stopped engaging during the date, and has been ghosting her since. He mentions not wanting to spend more money on another date if there's no sexual outcome.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship dynamics. Ghosting is generally frowned upon as it's abrupt and inconsiderate. However, the author is honest about his motivations\u2014his interest waned once he didn't get the sexual encounter he was hoping for. This raises questions about his intentions. Was he genuinely interested in building a relationship, or was he looking for a sexual encounter from the start? If the latter, then his reaction is about his own expectations not being met, but it's unfair to expect someone to meet his needs if they're not reciprocated.\n\nCasey's refusal is a valid personal boundary. Respecting someone's no is crucial, but the author's response is to cut off communication entirely. While he's under no obligation to continue the interaction, ghosting is often seen as cowardly because it doesn't allow for closure. The author's focus on the money spent also suggests a transactional view of the date, which might be problematic. Relationships shouldn't be about keeping score or expecting something in return.\n\nHowever, the author is honest about his feelings. He's not pretending to be interested anymore. The question is whether his actions are inconsiderate. Ghosting can be harmful, but the context here is that he lost interest after a specific expectation wasn't met. If he had clearly communicated his expectations beforehand, perhaps they wouldn't be in this situation. But since he went on the date and then changed his mind, it's his prerogative, but it's still inconsiderate to ghost instead of a polite breakup.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, many might see the author as in the wrong because he didn't respect the relationship enough to handle the rejection maturely. However, others might argue that he's justified in losing interest and not wanting to pursue a relationship where his needs aren't met. The key here is that the author wasn't upfront about his expectations. If he was only interested in a sexual encounter and didn't communicate that, then the rejection is his own fault. But if he had a genuine interest in a relationship but had ulterior motives, then his reaction is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are inconsiderate, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the interpretation of his initial intentions. Since he didn't clearly communicate his expectations and then ghosted after rejection, he's likely in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
