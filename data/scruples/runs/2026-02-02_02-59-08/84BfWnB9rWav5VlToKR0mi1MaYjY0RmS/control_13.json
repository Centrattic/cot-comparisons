We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author went on a first date with Casey. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" but she said no, not tonight. He mentions he thought she had a crush on him for months, so he expected an easy yes. When she declined, he zoned out during dinner, didn't respond well, and after the date, he ghosted her. Now he's asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to talk to her anymore because she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and respect. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is good, but maybe he didn't consider hers. Casey said she wanted things to develop slowly, which is her right. The problem is that the author lost interest because she didn't comply with his expectations. That's where things go wrong. \n\nRespecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if he's disappointed, cutting off communication entirely without explanation isn't fair. Ghosting can hurt the other person, and Casey has expressed interest in continuing the interaction. The author is prioritizing his own desires over her feelings, which isn't respectful. \n\nAlso, the mention of money spent on the date\u2014using that as a reason to ghost her shows a transactional view of the relationship, which isn't healthy. It's about mutual respect and emotional connection, not just physical gratification or financial cost.\n\nSo, the author's main mistake is not respecting her decision and then ghosting, which is inconsiderate. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
