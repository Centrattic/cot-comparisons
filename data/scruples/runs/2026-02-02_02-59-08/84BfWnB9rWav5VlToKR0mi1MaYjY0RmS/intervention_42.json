We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey have known each other for 8 months, with flirting for 2 months and rumors of her crush for 5-6 months. Their first date was a movie and dinner. The author asked directly if she wanted to go back to his place, expecting an easy yes, but she said no, not tonight. He then zoned out, didn't respond properly, and later ghosted her, not replying to her texts beyond brief responses.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest after she refused his request, and he's upset about the money spent on the date. He doesn't want to invest in a relationship where she might not reciprocate physically. The key points here are his decision to ghost her and his focus on her refusal as the reason for disinterest.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author felt his interest waned, cutting off communication abruptly is unkind. Casey said she liked him and wanted to take things slower, which shows she values the relationship but has boundaries. The author's decision to ghost because she didn't comply with his expectations could be seen as disrespectful to her boundaries and feelings. \n\nAdditionally, his focus on not wanting to spend money again and the risk of not getting anything in return suggests a transactional view of the relationship, which isn't healthy. Respecting someone's no and their pace is important in any relationship. His reaction might be understandable if he felt it wasn't mutual, but the way he ended things is where he goes wrong. \n\nSo, considering the social norms around communication and respect in relationships, the author's actions do make him the asshole. He didn't handle the situation maturely by communicating his feelings instead of ghosting. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
