We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no to fooling around on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author asked Casey to go back to his place, expecting a positive response because he thought she had a crush on him. She declined, and he lost interest, leading him to ghost her. The key points here are the communication, the respect for her decision, and the consequences of his actions.\n\nIn relationships or dating, mutual respect is crucial. If someone says no, it's important to honor that decision. The author's assumption that Casey would agree because of her supposed crush might be a bit presumptuous. Even if she had shown interest beforehand, that doesn't mean she's obligated to have sex on the first date. Everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. The author's motivation was losing interest after her refusal, which is his personal reaction. However, the act of ghosting, regardless of the reason, can be hurtful. The fact that he was focused on the money spent on the date might also indicate a transactional mindset, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings. He admits he lost interest and doesn't want to waste time on a second date if the outcome is uncertain. But is that a valid reason to ghost? Maybe he could have communicated his feelings more clearly instead of cutting off contact. However, if he genuinely felt there was no future, maybe he's not entirely at fault for moving on.\n\nBut the main issue here is the ghosting. Even if he's moving on, not responding to her texts is dismissive. Casey was reaching out, showing concern, and he ignored it. That's where he's definitely in the wrong. The act of ghosting is a form of emotional manipulation, as it leaves the other person confused and upset.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author made a mistake by assuming consent based on prior interest, handled rejection poorly by ghosting, and didn't communicate his feelings. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
