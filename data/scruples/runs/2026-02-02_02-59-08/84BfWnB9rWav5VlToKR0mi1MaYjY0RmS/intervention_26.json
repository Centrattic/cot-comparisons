We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who ghosted a girl after she said no to fooling around on the first date. The author is upset because he thought she had a crush on him for months, but when he asked, she declined. He lost interest and stopped responding, so now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author approached the girl directly about physical intimacy on the first date, which might be seen as too soon. She declined, wanting to take it slower, and he then lost interest. Ghosting after a rejection can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. The author's reasoning is about his own loss of interest and the money spent, but that's not a valid justification for cutting someone off abruptly.\n\nI should think about social norms and respect. People have the right to set boundaries, and respecting those is important. The author's actions might be seen as using the girl for potential physical benefits and then abandoning her when that didn't happen. The fact that he didn't respond to her texts afterward adds to the ghosting aspect, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude of expecting a \"yes\" based on her supposed crush for months might reflect a lack of understanding of her needs for a connection beyond physical. It's possible he was more focused on his own desires rather than building a relationship. The money spent is his own, and while it's frustrating, it's not a reason to ghost someone.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't respect her decision and cut her off, which makes him the asshole. Answer A.\n"
