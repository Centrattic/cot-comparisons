We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user provided a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario where the author ghosted a girl named Casey after she didn't sleep with him on their first date. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and Casey have known each other for 8 months, with flirting going on for 2 months. There were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, did normal activities like dinner and a movie. The author was honest and bluntly asked her if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and mentioned she wasn't \"like that,\" wanting things to develop on the second date. The author then zoned out, felt like he \"struck out,\" thought about the money spent, and after the date he ghosted her despite her trying to communicate afterward. He says he lost interest and doesn't want to talk or go out again, feeling it's a waste if he doesn't get what he wants.\n\nNow, considering the morality and social norms here. The author approached the first date with the expectation of physical intimacy, which might be seen as premature. The girl clearly set boundaries, and he didn't respect her decision, leading to his disinterest and ghosting. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and inconsiderate, leaving the other person confused and hurt. The author's reasoning is that he's not interested anymore because she didn't meet his expectations, but that doesn't excuse the ghosting. He also mentions the money he spent, which adds a transactional aspect that's problematic. Relationships shouldn't be about financial exchange or conditional on physical intimacy. The author's actions show a lack of respect for her boundaries and a self-centered approach. Even if he lost interest, the proper thing would be to communicate that respectfully rather than ghosting. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for ghosting her and for his initial approach of expecting physical intimacy on the first date without considering her pace and boundaries.\n"
