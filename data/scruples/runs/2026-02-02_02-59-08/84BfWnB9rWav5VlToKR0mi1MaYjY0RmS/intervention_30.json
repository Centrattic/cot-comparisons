We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is that they had a date, he asked if she wanted to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author approached the situation with the expectation of physical intimacy early on, which Casey didn't agree to. He then decided to end communication, which is ghosting. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI should think about social norms and consent. Expecting someone to have sex on the first date might not be respectful of their boundaries. Casey made it clear she wanted to take things slower, which is her right. The author's reaction of losing all interest and ghosting could be seen as dismissive and not taking her feelings into account. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect might be a factor in his decision, but that's not a good reason to ghost someone. The fact that he didn't respond to her texts shows a lack of communication, which is often considered rude. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that everyone has their own preferences in relationships, and if he's only interested in a physical relationship and she's not, then he's justified in moving on. However, ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. Proper communication would be better, even if ending the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate. He didn't respect her decision to take things slower and didn't communicate his feelings properly. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate, so the answer would be that he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
