We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author met Casey, they were flirting for two months, and he thought she had a crush on him. They went on a first date, which included dinner and a movie. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to fool around, expecting a yes because he thought she liked him. But she said no and suggested waiting for the second date. He then zoned out during dinner, thought about the money he spent, and after the date, gave a limp hug and didn't respond to her texts. Now he's ghosting her because she didn't give him what he wanted. He claims he lost interest because she wasn't willing to sleep with him on the first date.\n\nSo the main question is: is the author in the wrong here? The user says they think the author is wrong but want my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nBreaking it down, the author's actions are based on his own expectations. He approached her with the intention of having sex, believed she was interested, and became upset when she didn't comply. He then cut her off, ignoring her efforts to communicate. This seems to disregard her boundaries and feelings. Respect is a key factor here. Even if someone is disappointed, respecting the other person's decision is important. Ghosting, especially after she reached out, is inconsiderate and potentially hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the money is a bit of a red flag. Using financial aspects as a reason to devalue her decision shows a transactional view, which isn't healthy. The fact that he lost interest immediately after her refusal suggests that his interest was conditional on her meeting his expectations, which isn't a solid foundation for a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's being honest about his feelings and that his interest waned. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting, not responding to her texts\u2014lacks communication and consideration. Mature handling would involve explaining his feelings, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundaries, allowed his disappointment to lead to ghosting, and didn't communicate properly. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
