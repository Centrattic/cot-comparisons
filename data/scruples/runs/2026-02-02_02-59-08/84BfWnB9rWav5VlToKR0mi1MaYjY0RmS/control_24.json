We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, the guy went on a first date with Casey, and he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and mentioned that she wanted things to develop. He then lost interest and started ghosting her. The key points here are his actions and his reasoning.\n\nHe admits he was honest, which is good, but then he expected a certain outcome and got upset when she didn't meet his expectations. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because you cut off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, ending things abruptly without a conversation could be seen as hurtful. \n\nCasey made it clear she wanted things to progress slowly, and he respected that initially but then didn't follow up properly. By ghosting, he's avoiding communication, which isn't a mature way to handle rejection. Also, he mentions being upset about the money spent on the date, which adds a materialistic angle. That's not a good reason to ghost someone.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different boundaries and expectations. If he was clear from the start about what he wanted, but she wasn't interested, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, the way he handled the aftermath is the issue. Ghosting is typically frowned upon regardless of the reason. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings properly and chose to disappear instead of explaining why he's not interested anymore. That's being inconsiderate and hurtful, even if his reasons are his own.\n"
