We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't agree to have sex on the first date. The author seems to think that because he was honest upfront and expected a certain outcome, her refusal led him to lose interest, so he's ghosting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations around dating and communication. The author approached the situation very directly, asking if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" He might have assumed that since there were rumors she liked him, she would say yes. However, her response was that she wasn't ready and wanted to take things slower. \n\nNow, the key point is whether it's acceptable to ghost someone after they don't meet your expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author lost interest, cutting off communication abruptly without explaining is typically frowned upon. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the money spent on the date as a factor. While he might feel it's a loss, using that as a reason to ghost isn't a valid justification. The value of a date shouldn't be measured in money but in mutual respect and consideration.\n\nThe author's actions seem to prioritize his own desires and feelings over Casey's, without respecting her boundaries. Even if he was honest, respecting her decision is important. Ghosting after she expressed her stance isn't respectful. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone clearly states they have no interest in progressing in a relationship, it's acceptable to disengage. But in this case, Casey did express interest in continuing to see him, just at a different pace. The author's response was to shut down communication instead of having an open discussion about his expectations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for ghosting her without a clear explanation and for letting his disappointment in not getting what he wanted affect his treatment of her.\n"
