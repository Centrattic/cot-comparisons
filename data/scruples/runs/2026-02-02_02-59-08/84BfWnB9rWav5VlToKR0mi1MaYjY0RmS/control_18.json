We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author asked Casey directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest and stopped responding, hence ghosting.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's okay to ghost someone for not meeting your sexual expectations on the first date. Let's break it down. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if the author is disappointed, cutting off Casey abruptly without a conversation is disrespectful. Relationships, even casual ones, require some level of communication and mutual respect. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as prioritizing his own desires over her boundaries. Casey said no, which is her right, and the author's response was to end all contact. That could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and her decision to take things slower. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being upset about the money spent on the date. While financial concerns are valid, using that as a reason to ghost someone is shallow and not a good justification. \n\nHowever, the author claims he's being honest and that he lost interest. People have different expectations in dating, and if someone is clear about needing a certain level of physical intimacy and the other person doesn't meet that, it's understandable they might not want to continue. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the problem lies. \n\nSo, even if the author's expectations weren't met, the appropriate response would be to have a conversation, not to ghost. Therefore, he is in the wrong for the way he handled the situation, even if his feelings are understandable.\n"
