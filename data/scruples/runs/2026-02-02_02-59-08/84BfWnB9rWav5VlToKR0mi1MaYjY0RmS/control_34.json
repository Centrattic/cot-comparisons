We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who ghosted a girl named Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The main points here are about communication, respect, and expectations in relationships.\n\nFirst, the guy went on a first date with Casey. They did typical first date things like watching a movie, dinner. He then asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and mentioned that she wasn't \"like that,\" wanting to take things slower. He then zoned out, didn't engage much after that, and later ghosted her. Now he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, I need to consider a few things. The guy's actions: He asked for sex on the first date, which might be seen as moving too quickly. But he was upfront and honest, which is good. However, when she declined, his reaction was to shut down, lose interest, and ghost her. Ghosting is generally considered disrespectful because it leaves the other person without closure. \n\nRespecting boundaries is crucial. Even if someone says no, the correct response is to respect that and continue the relationship if both parties are still interested. The fact that he lost all interest after a refusal might indicate that his main goal was to have sex, not to build a relationship. That's not necessarily unethical, but how he handled it is. Ghosting is a poor way to handle rejection.\n\nAlso, the mention of \"wasting money\" on the date suggests that his judgment may have been clouded by transactional thinking\u2014viewing the date as an expense for a potential reward (sex). When that didn't happen, he felt it was a loss and lost interest. This could be seen as treating the relationship as a means to an end rather than valuing the person for who she is.\n\nOn the other hand, he was honest about his intentions. If he was looking for a casual encounter and she wasn't interested, it's his choice to disengage. But the problem is the ghosting. Even if he's not interested anymore, communicating that respectfully is better than cutting off all contact.\n\nIn many cases, ghosting is considered a yes, because it's inconsiderate and leaves the other person hanging. The fact that he's using the excuse of \"not wanting to waste time/money again\" shows a lack of respect for her decision and his own responsibility to communicate his feelings.\n\nSo putting it all together, the guy's actions were disrespectful in how he handled the rejection. He's in the wrong because ghosting is a poor response, regardless of his motivations. The key issue is the lack of communication and respect for her boundaries.\n"
