We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is presented through an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario. The answer should be A or B, indicating whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author went on a first date with Casey. They had dinner and a movie. The author directly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" expecting consent since there were rumors of a crush. Casey declined, saying she wasn't ready and wants things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and justified it by saying he doesn't want to invest more time/money without the same outcome. He also mentions feeling like he wasted money.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a direct move, was rejected, and then ghosted her. The question is whether this is acceptable or if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, respect for others' boundaries is crucial. Even if the author felt rejected, he had a responsibility to communicate his feelings and not just ghost. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author's reasoning (losing interest due to not getting what he wanted) shows a lack of respect for her decision and his own emotional maturity. Also, the money spent isn't a valid justification for how he treated her. People have the right to set their boundaries, and the author should have accepted her choice even if he was disappointed.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach of bluntly asking for sex on the first date might not have been the best strategy, but the main issue here is the reaction to the rejection. Ghosting is typically seen as a problem because it's dismissive and can hurt the other person. The fact that Casey tried to reach out after and the author ignored her makes it worse.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the rejection respectfully and chose to ghost, which is harmful and disrespectful.\n"
