We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The user is asking if it's okay to ghost someone because they didn't have sex on the first date. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author met Casey 8 months ago, they were flirting for 2 months, and there were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, did typical date things, and then the author asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and said they'd see on the second date. He thought he had a \"done deal\" but was surprised by her rejection. He then zoned out during the rest of the date, thinking about the money spent, gave a limp air hug, and didn't respond to her texts after. He's justifying ghosting her because he lost interest and doesn't want to invest more time or money without the chance of sex again.\n\nSo, the main question is whether his actions are wrong. Let me consider different perspectives. \n\nFirst, consent and respect. The author approached her directly about sex, which she declined. She set a boundary, and he respected that initially but then became distant. However, after the rejection, he seems to have been focused on his own feelings of rejection and financial loss. His response to her subsequent texts (ghosting) could be seen as dismissive and possibly hurtful. \n\nIn terms of communication, he didn't talk to her about his feelings. Instead, he just stopped responding. Healthy relationships require communication, so cutting off contact without explanation might be inconsiderate. Even if he lost interest, a direct and honest conversation would have been better.\n\nAnother angle is the value placed on sexual activity. The author seems to be treating the relationship as a means to an end (sex), which can be problematic. If Casey didn't meet his expectations, he's cutting her off, which might indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries and individuality. \n\nFinancial considerations are also part of his reasoning. He mentions the money spent on the date, implying that he feels he's entitled to something in return, which is a transactional view of relationships. This isn't healthy and could contribute to his negative reaction upon rejection.\n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his loss of interest. People can lose interest in someone after a rejection, and it's understandable. However, the way he's handling it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nIn dating culture, there's often an expectation that people will communicate their needs and feelings. The author's approach lacks this, so he's not being respectful of Casey's feelings. Even if he's not the one hurt, his actions could cause her emotional distress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's ghosting someone who tried to maintain contact, didn't pursue him after a rejection, and he's prioritizing his own disappointment over her feelings. He should have communicated his feelings instead of cutting her off abruptly. The answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
