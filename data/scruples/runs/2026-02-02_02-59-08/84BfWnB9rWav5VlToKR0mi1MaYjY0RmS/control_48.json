We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, known each other for eight. On their first date, he asked if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. He thought she had a crush for months, so he was surprised. He then zoned out during dinner, focused on the money spent. After the date, he didn't respond to her texts, just minimal replies. He claims he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him, and he doesn't want to invest more time or money. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nNow, evaluating this. Ghosting is generally considered rude because you cut off communication without explanation. Even if he's not interested anymore, a simple explanation would be better. The author's main issue is that he expected a certain outcome (sex on the first date) and when it didn't happen, he decided to end the interaction abruptly. This sets a problematic precedent because it shows he was only interested in a physical relationship and not in her as a person. It's disrespectful to Casey because she expressed a desire to take things slower, and instead of having an open conversation, he ignored her. The financial aspect mentioned (\"spent a fair bit of change\") also seems like an excuse to justify his actions, which isn't a valid reason to treat someone poorly. \n\nAdditionally, the author didn't respond to her follow-up messages, which is ghosting. Ghosting is widely seen as inconsiderate. Even if he lost interest, a polite goodbye would have been better. His behavior shows a lack of maturity and respect for her boundaries. People have different comfort levels, and expecting someone to sleep with you on the first date isn't reasonable. The fact that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" suggests he wasn't considering her feelings or her decision. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are inconsiderate, disrespectful, and inconsiderate. He's in the wrong because he ghosted her without explanation, used money as a justification, and didn't respect her decision to take things slow. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
