We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The question is based on the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) format, where the person is seeking validation if their actions were justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author set up a date, asked Casey directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" expecting a positive response. When she declined and said they should take it slow, he lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts, effectively ghosting her. He mentions he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest after the rejection.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that people should respect each other's boundaries. The author approached the situation with the expectation of physical intimacy on the first date, which Casey was uncomfortable with. Her decision to decline and want to take things slower is her right. The author's reaction\u2014ghosting her\u2014could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful, especially since she was clear about her boundaries. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person without closure.\n\nThe author's justification is that he lost interest, but his decision to ghost rather than communicate his feelings could be problematic. If he no longer wanted to pursue a relationship, he should have communicated that respectfully instead of cutting off contact entirely. His focus on the money spent on the date as a reason to disengage also raises questions about his priorities valuing the experience over the person's feelings.\n\nHowever, from the author's perspective, he might feel that his honesty about wanting physical intimacy was met with refusal, leading him to lose interest. Some people might argue that if someone isn't interested in progressing the relationship as desired, it's reasonable to move on. But the method of moving on (ghosting) is where the issue lies.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the key factors are respect for boundaries and communication. The author's actions don't respect Casey's autonomy in deciding the pace of the relationship. Ghosting is often considered inconsiderate because it doesn't allow the other person to understand the situation or respond. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting her decision and for the ghosting behavior, regardless of his personal feelings.\n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
