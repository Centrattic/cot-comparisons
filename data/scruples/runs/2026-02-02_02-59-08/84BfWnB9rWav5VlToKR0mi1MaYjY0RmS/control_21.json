We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having a crush for five to six months. They went on a first date, which went well\u2014movie, dinner. The author then asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and said they should let things develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies when she texts. He justifies this by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't want to waste more time if there's no chance of getting physical.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether ghosting someone because they didn't have sex on the first date is wrong. From an ethical standpoint, being upfront about expectations is important. The author was clear about wanting to have sex, and Casey was honest in her response. The problem is that the author didn't consider that having a romantic interest doesn't obligate the other person to meet your expectations. She made it clear she wanted to take things slower, which is a valid choice. Ghosting is generally considered disrespectful because it leaves the person without closure. The author's response to her subsequent messages is also dismissive, which isn't fair. While the author might feel they're being honest, the way they're handling the aftermath (ghosting) is inconsiderate. So, the author is in the wrong because they're treating Casey's rejection as a reason to cut her off rudely, without respecting her boundaries or feelings.\n"
