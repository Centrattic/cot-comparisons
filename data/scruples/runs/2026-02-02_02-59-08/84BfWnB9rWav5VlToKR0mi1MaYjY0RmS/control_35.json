We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't agree to have sex on the first date. The situation is from an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) perspective, which usually seeks community judgment on whether someone's actions were rude or unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author and Casey have been flirting for two months and there were rumors she had feelings for him. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author bluntly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" expecting a positive response because he thought she had a crush on him. When she said no, he zoned out, gave a limp hug, and then ghosted her, only responding minimally to her texts. He justifies this by saying he lost interest and didn't want to waste more money on dates if there's no chance of getting physical.\n\nThe key points here are the author's approach to the situation. He approached the first date with the expectation of immediate physical intimacy, which might not have been communicated or mutual. When she declined, he didn't engage in the conversation and later ghosted her. His reasoning is that he's not interested in continuing if there's no immediate sexual opportunity, but that could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries and feelings.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it abruptly cuts off communication without explanation. Even if the author feels disinterested, not responding to her messages is inconsiderate. Casey wanted to continue the relationship and set a boundary, which is her right. The author's focus on his own loss of interest and financial concerns might be prioritizing his needs over hers. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are important. The author didn't give Casey a chance to explain further or discuss her perspective. Instead, he ended the interaction without closure, which can be hurtful. His actions may be seen as the wrong because he ghosted someone who was trying to maintain contact and had her own standards. The fact that he acknowledged her texts but only with minimal responses shows a lack of effort to be polite or considerate.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because ghosting after a rejection, especially when the other person shows interest in continuing the relationship, is disrespectful and unkind. He should have communicated his feelings more clearly rather than cutting her off.\n"
