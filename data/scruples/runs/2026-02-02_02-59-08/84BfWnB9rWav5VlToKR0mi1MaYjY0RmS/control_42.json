We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person, let's call them John, went on a first date with Casey. They had dinner and a movie. John asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and mentioned that she's not like that. She also said she likes him and wants things to develop. John thought he had a \"done deal\" because she supposedly had a crush on him for months. He didn't respond well, got awkward, and after the date, just stopped talking to her. Now he's just giving her thumbs up or minimal replies when she texts him.\n\nThe question is whether John is the asshole here. The options are A (he's in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's consider consent and respect. John asked her to have sex on the first date, which might be a big ask for some people. She said no, and he took it as a rejection of him, leading him to ghost her. Ghosting is generally considered a bad practice because it's abrupt and dismissive. Even if he felt rejected, ending communication suddenly without explanation can be hurtful.\n\nThen there's the aspect of assuming her consent. He thought he had a \"done deal\" because of the rumors and her supposed crush. That's problematic because someone's interest in friendship or being around you doesn't automatically mean they want physical intimacy. Pressuring someone for sex on the first date, especially if they're not comfortable with it, isn't respectful. \n\nJohn also mentions the money he spent. Valuing a person's worth in terms of money spent on a date is a red flag. Relationships shouldn't be transactional in that way. If he's only interested in a relationship for sexual purposes and sees the date as a \"loss\" financially, that's a problem. \n\nHowever, he did say that he lost interest after her refusal. While that's his personal choice, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. Being honest about his feelings might have been better, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's allowed to feel disappointed and not want to pursue a relationship if his expectations aren't met. But the key here is how he handled the situation. Ghosting isn't a constructive way to deal with rejection. \n\nSo, putting it all together: John pressured for sex on the first date, which she refused. He then cut off communication abruptly, which is disrespectful. His motivation might be more about his own expectations and financial loss rather than her well-being. Therefore, he's in the wrong because of the ghosting and the initial pressure for intimacy too soon.\n"
