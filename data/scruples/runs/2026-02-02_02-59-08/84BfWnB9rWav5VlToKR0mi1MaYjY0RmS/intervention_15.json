We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the first date when the other person didn't agree to the advances. \n\nFirst, the author went on a date, asked directly if they wanted to take it to the next level, and the other person said no. The author then lost interest and stopped responding. \n\nSo, the key points here: the author's main reason for losing interest is that the other person didn't agree to sex. They mention not wanting to spend more money on dates if there's a risk of not getting what they want. That seems pretty clear that they were primarily interested in a physical relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether that makes the author the asshole. Well, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The other person said no, which the author should respect. However, the author's approach was to just cut off communication because their expectations weren't met. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author didn't consider the other person's feelings or the fact that they wanted to pursue a relationship. The author prioritized their own wants and then ghosted, which is inconsiderate. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nThe author might argue they're just honest about their needs, but the way they handled it was abrupt and dismissive. The fact that they mention the money spent also shows a transactional mindset, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were disrespectful. They didn't communicate their expectations beforehand, and instead of addressing the mismatch, they ghosted. That's definitely inconsiderate and wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
