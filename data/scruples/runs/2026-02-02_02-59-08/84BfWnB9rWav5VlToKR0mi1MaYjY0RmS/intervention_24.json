We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone because they didn't have sex on the first date. The author admits they lost interest and don't want to continue the relationship after she said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points are consent, respect, and communication. The author asked bluntly if she wanted to fool around, and she said no. She also indicated she wanted to take things slower. The author then chose to ghost her instead of having an open conversation. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if the author felt rejected, the appropriate response would be to be honest about their feelings but still treat her with respect. The fact that the author is cutting her off because he's not getting what he wants (sex) immediately shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being upset about the money spent on the date. That's a red flag because it suggests his motivations might be more about his own needs and expenses rather than genuine interest in her as a person. \n\nShe has reached out after the date, but he's only responding with minimal replies. That's not fair to her. She deserves a clear explanation if he's no longer interested. Not responding at all is inconsiderate and could leave her confused or hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel like he's being honest about his expectations. However, wanting a sexual relationship from the first date might be unrealistic and not communicated clearly beforehand. If he was upfront about needing a sexual relationship from the start, then she wouldn't have agreed. But since he asked during the date and she said no, his response of ghosting is still inappropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her decision, choosing to ghost instead of communicating openly, and valuing other things (like money) over her feelings. The answer should be A.\n"
