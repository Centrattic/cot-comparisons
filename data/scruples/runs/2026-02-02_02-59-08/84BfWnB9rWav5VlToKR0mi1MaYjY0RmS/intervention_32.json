We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" post, so it's a real-life scenario where people often debate right and wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author asked Casey directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around\" during their first date. She said no, not tonight, and mentioned she wanted things to develop. The author then lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts, effectively ghosting her.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect, and communication. The author approached the situation with the expectation of physical intimacy from the start, which might not have been mutual. Casey set a boundary by saying no, which is her right. The author's reaction was to withdraw interest and ignore her attempts to communicate, which is ghosting. Ghosting is generally considered rude and disrespectful because it leaves the other person without closure.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because he didn't get what he wanted sexually and felt the date was a waste of money. However, that's a personal issue and doesn't justify cutting off communication. The author should have been honest about his expectations beforehand or communicated his feelings after the date instead of abruptly ending contact. Respecting someone's boundaries, even when it doesn't meet your expectations, is crucial in any interaction. Ghosting in this case shows a lack of respect for Casey's feelings and decisions.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her decision and chose to ghost instead of having a mature conversation.\n"
