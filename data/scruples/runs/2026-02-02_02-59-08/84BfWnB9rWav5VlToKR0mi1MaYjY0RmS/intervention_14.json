We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer was upfront about wanting to fool around during their first date. Casey said no and suggested waiting for the second date. The writer then lost interest, stopped engaging during the rest of the date, and hasn't responded to her texts, essentially ghosting her. \n\nNow, thinking about expectations and consent. The writer clearly communicated his intent, but Casey set boundaries. The problem here is that the writer didn't respect her decision. Ghosting her after she refused his initial request is dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions that he felt the money was wasted and only lost interest because of the lack of sexual activity. That's a red flag. Using a person's refusal for sex as a reason to cut them off without communication is not healthy or respectful. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. The writer's actions show he prioritized his own needs over Casey's feelings and boundaries. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Even if he's honest, he didn't have the right to punish her for not meeting his expectations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. He should have communicated his feelings more clearly instead of ghosting, and respecting her boundaries should have been a priority, even if he lost interest.\n"
