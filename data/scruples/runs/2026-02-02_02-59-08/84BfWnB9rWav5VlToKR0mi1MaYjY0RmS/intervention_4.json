We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the woman didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, the author went on a first date with Casey. They had dinner and a movie. He directly asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, and he ghosted her afterward. He's justifying his actions by saying he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him, and he's upset about the money spent.\n\nHmm. From a moral standpoint, is it wrong to ghost someone because they didn't have sex on the first date? Well, relationships are about mutual respect and consent. The author approached the date with the expectation that there would be sexual activity, which might not align with Casey's boundaries. She made it clear she wanted to take things slower, but he decided to cut her off because his expectations weren't met. That seems to be the issue here.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if he's not interested anymore, a respectful response would be to explain why. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent suggests he might have been more interested in the sex than in her as a person, which is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, people do have the right to change their minds about someone they're interested in. But the key here is that he ghosted her without giving her a chance to explain or to see where things could go. Plus, pressuring for sex on the first date isn't ideal, and respecting her decision to wait is important.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. He didn't communicate his feelings properly, ghosted her, and his actions seem to be based on his own expectations not being met rather than respecting her boundaries.\n"
