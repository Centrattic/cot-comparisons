We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote theAITA post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Casey have been flirting for a couple of months, and he thought she had a crush on him. They went on a first date where he asked her if they could go back to his place, and she said no, wanting to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding except for minimal replies, and hasn't engaged with her since.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The author's actions involve ghosting, which is cutting off communication without explanation. Ghosting is often seen as disrespectful because the other person is left confused and without closure. The author justified it by saying he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations for physical intimacy. But that raises questions about his intentions from the start.\n\nWas the author's interest conditional on her agreeing to have sex on the first date? If so, that's a red flag. Healthy relationships should value emotional connection and mutual respect, not just physical aspects. By ghosting her, he didn't take responsibility for his part in the conversation. He also mentioned feeling like he wasted money, which might indicate he viewed the date as an investment for personal gain rather than a genuine attempt to get to know her.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different boundaries and expectations. If the author was honest about his intentions upfront, maybe Casey wasn't a good match. However, the way he handled the rejection\u2014disengaging completely without communication\u2014is problematic. Even if he wasn't interested anymore, a respectful response would be to explain his feelings instead of ghosting.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was surprised by her refusal suggests he might have misread her signals. She indicated she wanted things to develop further, which is reasonable. His immediate loss of interest after one refusal could mean he wasn't serious about building a relationship and was focused on a specific outcome.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are dismissive and disrespectful. He didn't handle the situation with empathy or honesty, leading to ghosting. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
