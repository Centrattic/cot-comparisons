We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The story is from Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so it's a real-life situation where people discuss their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author knew Casey for 8 months, had been flirting for 2 months, and there were rumors she had a crush on him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not that night, and suggested the second date. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and only gave minimal replies to her texts. He cites losing interest and not wanting to spend more money if there's no physical reward.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The author initiated a direct question about physical intimacy, and she declined. The fact that he had been aware of her interest but still approached it this way might indicate he didn't consider her feelings or boundaries properly. Ghosting after a refusal can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. People have the right to say no, and a healthy relationship should be based on mutual respect and communication, not conditional on physical intimacy from the start.\n\nHowever, the author claims he's being honest and that he's lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations. But the key issue here is that he's ending the interaction because she didn't comply with his desire for physical contact, which is a form of conditional acceptance. This can be considered disrespectful and manipulative, especially since he was aware of her interest. It also raises questions about his motivations for pursuing the relationship\u2014whether it was genuine or based on his own needs.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that if he's not interested in a non-physical relationship, he's not the asshole for moving on. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and not communicating\u2014lacks respect for her feelings. A better approach would be to have an open conversation about his expectations and why he's distancing himself, rather than cutting off all contact abruptly.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful towards Casey's autonomy and her decision to set boundaries. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
