We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author mentions they went on a date, he asked her to go back to his place, she declined, and he lost interest, leading him to ghost her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author didn't communicate his feelings clearly after the date, even though he's honest about his intentions. He admits to zoning out and not responding properly during the date, which might have already hurt her feelings. \n\nThen there's the issue of assuming sex was expected. While some people might have different expectations, the author explicitly asked her, so her refusal was a clear \"no.\" He thought it was an \"easy sell,\" which shows he might have had ulterior motives for the date, prioritizing sex over actually getting to know her. That's a red flag.\n\nThe financial aspect he mentions\u2014feeling like he wasted money\u2014could be a factor, but it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. People date for various reasons, and using money as a leverage point is problematic. \n\nHe also didn't respond to her follow-up texts, which indicates a lack of respect for her feelings. Even if he lost interest, a polite explanation would be better than ghosting. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his right to lose interest, but the way he handled it is where the issue lies. The key points are the lack of communication, the assumption that sex was expected without clear consent, and the dismissive behavior afterward. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions were disrespectful and inconsiderate, making him the asshole here. The answer should be A.\n"
