We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author explains that he asked her outright if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no, saying they should see on the second date. Then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. The author is being honest about his intentions, but the way he's handling the rejection might be the issue. He mentions he zoned out during the date, didn't respond properly, and now is ignoring her messages. Even though he says he's not trying to hurt her, the act of ghosting can hurt someone's feelings regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of respecting someone's boundaries. She said no, and he seems to have taken it as a personal rejection, leading him to stop communication. While it's his choice to not pursue a relationship where he wants physical intimacy immediately, cutting contact without a clear explanation can be seen as disrespectful. People have different values, but in many social contexts, being upfront about losing interest is better than ghosting.\n\nThe author also mentions spending money on the date and feeling like it was a waste. That's his perspective, but she made it clear she wasn't interested in that step yet. It's important to consider that her decision to wait is her right, and his reaction might be more about his own expectations than her actions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision to ghost is inconsiderate. Even if he's honest about his intentions, not communicating and ignoring her messages is hurtful. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
