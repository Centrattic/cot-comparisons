We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) story is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author thought the girl had a crush on him, asked her directly if they could go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest, stopped responding, and now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author approached the situation by asking directly if they could have sex, and the girl declined, saying she wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest and ghosted her. His reasoning is that he felt like he had no point in continuing because he didn't want to invest more time and money if there wasn't immediate physical intimacy. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a general perspective, pressuring someone for sex is problematic. The fact that he asked bluntly and expected a yes might not be respectful of her boundaries. When she said no, he didn't respect her decision and instead of having a conversation, he ghosted her. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's not interested in continuing the interaction because she didn't meet his expectations. That could be seen as treating her as a means to an end (i.e., for sex) rather than valuing her as a person. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding, not transactional expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, he might argue that he was honest about his intentions and she didn't reciprocate. But the problem here is the approach: asking for sex so early and then devaluing her decision. The fact that he felt like he wasted money adds another layer of self-centeredness. \n\nIn most cases, when someone declines a sexual advance, the appropriate response is to respect their choice and decide whether you want to continue the relationship. If the author isn't okay with taking things slower, he should communicate that respectfully. Ghosting is not the solution. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for ghosting without explanation. The answer should be A.\n"
