We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months and there were rumors she had feelings for him. They went on a first date, and he asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and emphasized she wanted things to develop. The author then lost interest, didn't respond much, and ghosted her. \n\nThe main question is whether this makes him an asshole. The key points here are his honesty and her decision. He says he's big on being honest and laid his cards on the table. She was clear in her response, and he respected that up to a point but then cut off communication.\n\nNow, from a relationship standpoint, ghosting is generally considered rude. Even if someone has lost interest, cutting off contact without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt. The author mentions not wanting to invest more time or money if there's a risk of not getting what he wants, which sounds transactional. That's a red flag because relationships should be about mutual respect and emotional connection, not just physical expectations.\n\nAlso, Casey made it clear she wanted things to develop over time. The author's reaction implies that his primary interest was in a physical relationship, and when that wasn't immediate, he lost all interest. That's not fair to her. He should have considered her feelings and communicated his own boundaries if they were incompatible. \n\nHe did give a limp air hug and didn't respond to her texts. The fact that he's justifying it by talking about money spent is another issue. It's not about financial investment but about mutual respect. If he's not interested in continuing, it's better to be honest and polite rather than ghosting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. He chose to end the interaction abruptly without giving a clear explanation, which is where he's wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
