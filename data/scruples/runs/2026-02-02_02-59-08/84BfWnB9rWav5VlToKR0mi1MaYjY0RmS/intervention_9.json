We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author explains that they asked Casey bluntly if they wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. He thought he had a \"done deal\" because there were rumors she had a crush on him, but she wanted to take it slower. After that, he lost interest and started ignoring her texts.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: 1) The author was upfront about wanting to be physical on the first date. 2) Casey declined, wanting to take it to the second date. 3) The author, instead of respecting her boundaries, lost interest and ghosted her. 4) He mentions feeling like he wasted money and not wanting to risk it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect. The author approached Casey with a very direct question about wanting to be physical, and she clearly said no. That was her boundary. Even if the author had a lot of flirting and rumors leading him to believe she was interested, it's not her responsibility to meet his expectations. Respecting her decision is crucial.\n\nThen, the author's reaction is to ghost her and stop communicating. Ghosting is generally seen as immature and disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if he lost interest, he could have been honest and communicated that he was okay with moving forward but she wasn't, and that he respected her choice but they might not be compatible. Instead, he just cut her off, which is hurtful.\n\nThe financial aspect: he feels like he wasted money. But that's his responsibility. He chose to spend money on the date, and her decision not to have sex isn't a valid reason to treat her poorly. People go on dates with the expectation that it might not lead to immediate physical intimacy, and that's part of dating.\n\nAlso, the author's attitude seems to be that he was looking for a \"deal\" rather than building a genuine connection. Approaching a date with the mindset of expecting a specific outcome (sex) from the first meeting can lead to disappointment if things don't go as planned. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and communication, not transactional expectations.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while there's no one-size-fits-all in relationships, the act of ghosting is generally frowned upon. People have different boundaries and expectations, and when someone doesn't meet yours, it's better to have an open conversation rather than disappearing. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to Casey's autonomy and her right to set her own boundaries.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because he had the right to disinterest after the first date. But the method of ending the connection\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. Even if he no longer wants to pursue a relationship, being ghosted is hurtful regardless of the reason.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author made a mistake in how he handled the situation. He should have respected her decision and communicated his feelings instead of ghosting. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
