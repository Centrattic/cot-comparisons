We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who ghosted a girl named Casey after she said no to fooling around on the first date. He felt she had liked him for months, so he expected more, but when she declined, he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The key points are that the author was honest about his expectations, but Casey set boundaries. The author's reaction is based on his own expectations not being met, which is his prerogative, but how he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014might be the issue.\n\nHe spent money on the date and felt it was wasted when she didn't reciprocate his advances. While that's his perspective, it's not her responsibility to meet his expectations. Her choice to say no is her right, and he's choosing to punish her for that. That could be seen as unfair. Also, he acknowledges she's reached out after, but he's ignoring her. Ghosting is often seen as a lack of respect for the other person's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his lack of interest now. People can have different standards, and he might not be the asshole for realizing he's not interested in a slower pace. But the way he cut off communication without explanation is probably the problem. Even if he's not interested, a respectful response would be better than ghosting.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his actions (ghosting) are justified given his loss of interest. Since he's choosing to ghost rather than communicate, that's where he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
