We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author, let's call him John for simplicity, has been known to Casey for 8 months. They've been flirting for 2 of those months, and there were rumors that Casey had a crush on him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. John asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to fool around. Casey said \"no, not tonight,\" explaining she wasn't that type and wanted things to develop on a second date. The author then zoned out during the rest of the date, thinking about how he \"struck out\" and the money he spent. After the date, he gave a limp air hug and a kiss on the cheek. Since then, he's ghosted her, responding only with minimal texts. He's asking if he's the asshole for doing so because she didn't have sex with him on the first date.\n\nThe user's question is whether John is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. John went into the date with the expectation of physical intimacy. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place, which Casey refused. He then lost interest and ghosted her. The core issue here is whether it's acceptable to lose interest and cut off communication because someone didn't meet his sexual expectations on the first date.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, consent and respect are crucial. Casey said no, and John respected her wishes at the time by not pushing further. However, his response after the date was to ghost her due to his own disappointment. That's where the problem lies. Ghosting someone after they refuse to engage in sexual activity you expected can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. It might indicate that John's interest in Casey was conditional on her meeting his sexual expectations, which is not a healthy basis for a relationship.\n\nJohn's behavior after the date\u2014zoning out, thinking about the money spent, and then ghosting\u2014suggests that his primary motivation for the date was to get a physical relationship. If that's the case, then his actions could be seen as using Casey for that purpose, and when she refused, he lost interest. This is problematic because it shows a lack of genuine interest in building a relationship, and instead treating her as a means to an end.\n\nAdditionally, ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate. Even if John lost interest, the appropriate response would be to have an honest conversation, explaining that he's not interested in continuing to pursue a relationship. Cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful and is often seen as cowardly.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if John is honest about his expectations and she didn't meet them, he's not obligated to continue the relationship. But the key here is that John didn't communicate his expectations clearly from the beginning. He asked for a specific action during the first date, and when that didn't happen, he lost interest. That doesn't necessarily make him wrong in a legal or moral sense, but socially, it's often frowned upon to treat someone this way simply because they didn't comply with one's sexual desires.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"ghosting\" itself. Many people consider it inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Casey was reaching out after, trying to reconnect, and John's minimal responses show he's not engaging. This could be seen as emotionally manipulative or dismissive.\n\nIn terms of the money spent, John's frustration about the cost might be a contributing factor, but it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. Financial considerations shouldn't dictate the value of a person's autonomy or their right to set boundaries.\n\nOverall, while John may not have broken any laws, his actions cross into disrespectful territory. Respecting someone's decision to decline sexual activity is part of showing respect for their autonomy. Using that as a reason to end all communication is problematic. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
