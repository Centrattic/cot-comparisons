We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. Alright, so the situation is: they've been flirting for a while, went on a first date where he asked her to go back to his place, she said no, he lost interest, and now he's cutting her off. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author admitted to asking her bluntly if they could \"fool around\" and was confident she would say yes because of the rumors about her having a crush. She declined, stating she wanted things to develop further. He then lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts beyond minimal replies. The user is asking whether he's wrong for doing this.\n\nFrom a relationship and social etiquette standpoint, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The author's primary issue seems to be that he didn't anticipate her refusal and is now acting out of frustration or disappointment. Ghosting, which is cutting off communication suddenly, is generally considered rude and disrespectful, regardless of the reason. Even if he's not interested anymore, the way he's handling it by ignoring her attempts to communicate is problematic. \n\nAlso, the context of his reasoning\u2014he mentions the money spent on the date and not wanting to invest more if there's a chance of rejection\u2014shows a transactional view towards the relationship, which can be seen as shallow. However, people have different expectations, and if Casey knew what he was looking for, maybe she should have communicated better. But the act of ghosting is where the ethical issue lies. \n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect. She made her stance clear, and his reaction undermines her choice. Ghosting after a rejection can be hurtful and doesn't foster healthy interactions. Even if he's uninterested, a polite response or a clear explanation would be more respectful. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, he's in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
