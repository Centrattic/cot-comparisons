We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, the writer asked Casey directly if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around,\" expecting a positive response since there were rumors she had a crush. She said no and suggested waiting for the second date. The writer then lost interest, didn't engage much during the date, and has been ghosting her since.\n\nNow, considering the social norms around dating and consent. The woman declined his proposition, which was her right. The writer's immediate loss of interest and subsequent ghosting could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Additionally, the writer mentions not wanting to spend more money if there's a risk of not getting what he wants, which shows he was primarily interested in a physical relationship rather than building a connection. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The woman tried to reach out, but he ignored her. Even if he felt disappointed, cutting off communication without explanation is not considerate. While it's his choice to discontinue the relationship, the way he did it\u2014ghosting\u2014lacks respect. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's within his right to stop pursuing if his expectations weren't met. However, the situation is complicated by his blunt approach and the fact that he didn't handle the rejection gracefully. The key issue is the respectful treatment of others' boundaries. Since Casey set a boundary and he respected it, but then didn't follow up properly, it's more on him to handle the situation maturely rather than ghosting. \n\nSo, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong because ghosting is a disrespectful response to rejection, and he should have communicated his feelings or not pursued further in a more considerate way.\n"
