We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a first date with Casey. They asked her to fool around, she said no, and then he ghosted her. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't \"put out\" on the first date, and he's upset about the money spent and the lack of sexual interest from her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author approached her directly about wanting to have sex, which she declined. She indicated she wanted to take things slower and build a connection. The author, however, seems to have judged the entire relationship based on that one refusal. Ghosting someone after a first date, especially when the person is respectful in their refusal, is generally considered rude and dismissive. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author's main issue is that he wanted a sexual encounter immediately and when that didn't happen, he lost interest. That suggests he was more focused on his own desires rather than building a relationship. Ghosting is a form of cutting off communication without explanation, which can leave the other person confused and hurt. \n\nEven if the author isn't trying to be mean, his actions still hurt Casey. She reached out after the date, trying to maintain communication, but he ignored her. The fact that he's only interested if there's a chance of sex indicates that he didn't value the relationship beyond that one aspect. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest about his preferences. But the problem here is that he's using that honesty as an excuse to disrespect her boundaries. When someone says no, especially in a respectful manner, the appropriate response is to respect their decision rather than cutting them off. \n\nAdditionally, the author's focus on the money spent shows a lack of consideration. If he's in it for the relationship, then the cost shouldn't be the main factor. The fact that he's prioritizing his own disappointment over her feelings is a red flag. \n\nIn social norms, it's generally accepted that people have different boundaries and expectations. If someone isn't interested in immediate physical intimacy, it's up to the other person to respect that. The author's decision to ghost is a clear violation of that respect. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect Casey's boundaries and used ghosting as a way to avoid dealing with the situation. His actions were dismissive and hurtful, even if he didn't intend to be.\n"
