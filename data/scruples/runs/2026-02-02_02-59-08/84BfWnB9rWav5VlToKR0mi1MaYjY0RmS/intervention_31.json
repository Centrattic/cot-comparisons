We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author mentions he asked her outright if they could go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest, stopped responding, and now only gives minimal replies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Ghosting is generally seen negatively because it cuts off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the author's reasoning is that he lost all interest after being rejected. People have the right to set boundaries and prioritize their own feelings, but the way he handled it\u2014being dismissive and not communicating openly\u2014might be problematic.\n\nThe author's behavior includes not only ghosting but also not responding to her texts after the date. He didn't explain his feelings or the reasons for his withdrawal, which could leave her confused and hurt. Even if his interest waned, a more respectful approach would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's awkward. The fact that he's not engaging with her outreach suggests a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nAdditionally, the initial pressure for physical intimacy on the first date might be seen as inappropriate. While the author is honest, pushing for a sexual encounter so early could be off-putting. Casey's response that she wanted to take things slower is a valid boundary, and respecting that is part of healthy communication. The author's reaction\u2014ghosting because she didn't comply\u2014shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and a self-centered perspective.\n\nFinancial concerns about the date's cost might also play into his frustration, but that's not a valid reason to treat her poorly. The value of a date shouldn't be measured by immediate sexual satisfaction, and using it as a reason to cut her off is selfish.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might argue that the author's actions are a reflection of his personal preferences, the ghosting aspect is widely criticized. The key issue here is the absence of communication. Even if he's not in a relationship, being polite and respectful when disengaging is expected. His actions, while perhaps understandable from a personal standpoint, are inconsiderate and hurtful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, yes, the author is in the wrong. He didn't handle the situation respectfully, failed to communicate his feelings, and his actions could cause emotional harm. The right approach would have been to have an honest conversation, even if it was uncomfortable, rather than ghosting.\n"
