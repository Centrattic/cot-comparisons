We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author set up a date with someone they knew for 8 months, with mutual flirting and rumors of a crush. During the date, the author directly asked if they wanted to go back to his place, and Casey said \"no, not tonight.\" The author then lost interest, zoned out, and after the date, ghosted her. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be that he expected a sexual encounter on the first date, and when it didn't happen, he lost all interest. He also mentions the money spent, which adds a transactional element. Ghosting, however, is often considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author is no longer interested, cutting off communication abruptly is unkind.\n\nNow, considering Casey's side, she made it clear she wasn't ready for that level of intimacy and wanted to take things slower. That's her right. The author, however, didn't respect her boundaries and decided to end the relationship unilaterally without discussing it. If he wasn't okay with taking things slow, maybe he should have communicated that before the date. Instead, he led her on with the flirting and date, then ghosted when things didn't go his way.\n\nAnother angle: the author's approach was blunt and maybe too forward for a first date. Expecting a sexual encounter after a first date can be a red flag if the other person isn't on the same page. The fact that he was \"big on being honest\" led him to ask directly, but honesty shouldn't be used to pressure someone into a situation they're not comfortable with. Casey's response was a clear \"no,\" and the author's reaction\u2014losing interest and ghosting\u2014shows a lack of respect for her decision.\n\nAlso, the author's focus on the money spent is a bit selfish. While it's natural to feel it's a loss, that shouldn't be the reason to cut someone off. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and connection, not on transactional value.\n\nIn terms of ghosting, it's generally seen as inconsiderate because the other person is left wondering what went wrong. A better approach would be to have an open conversation, even if the author is no longer interested. At least that gives Casey a chance to understand and move on.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't respect Casey's boundaries by pushing for sex on the first date, and then compounded the issue by ghosting without explanation. That makes him the asshole here. The answer should be A.\n"
