We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author thought he had a deal, asked bluntly, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect. The author approached the date with the expectation of physical intimacy, which might not have been mutual. It's important to respect a person's boundaries if they say no. The girl made it clear she wanted things to develop over time, but the author's response was to cut off communication, which can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling like he wasted money, which shows he was more focused on his own investment rather than her feelings or her reasons for saying no. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. It leaves the other person confused and hurt, and doesn't give them closure. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his choice to pursue or not pursue a relationship. But the act of ghosting, especially after showing disinterest so suddenly, is often frowned upon because it lacks communication and consideration. The author didn't explain his feelings to Casey, which could have been more respectful, even if he decided he wasn't interested anymore.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions may be seen as the asshole move because he didn't respect her decision and exited the situation without addressing it properly, leading to ghosting. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
