We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and Casey have been flirting for two months, and there were rumors she had feelings for him for longer. They went on a first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author directly asked if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around\" and she said \"no, not tonight,\" saying they should see on the second date. The author then lost interest, stopped responding beyond minimal texts, and now is justifying it by saying he's saving money and doesn't want to invest more time if there's no possibility of sex.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The author admits he's ghosting her, not responding to her texts. Even if he lost interest, cutting off suddenly is inconsiderate. Also, he mentions the money spent, which is a bit materialistic. The fact that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" might show he wasn't respecting her boundaries. She said she's interested and wanted to take things slower, which is her right. His reaction seems to be about his own needs rather than respecting her pace. So, yes, he's inconsiderate and dismissive of her feelings. He's also treating her as a means to an end, which is disrespectful. So the answer would be A, he's the asshole.\n"
