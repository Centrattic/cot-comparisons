We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after they refused to have sex on the first date. The author admitted they lost interest because the woman didn't \"put out,\" which is a pretty clear indicator of being in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author approached the date with the expectation of physical intimacy, which is a bit problematic. It sounds like they went into the date with a \"win or lose\" mindset, treating the relationship as transactional. When Casey said no, the author's response was to lose interest entirely and cut her off, which is dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nThe fact that the author mentions the money spent on the date adds another layer of entitlement. It's about their own loss rather than considering Casey's boundaries and feelings. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, especially when there's no clear communication. The author didn't even give a chance to resolve the awkwardness or talk things through, which could have been a more mature approach.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for ghosting is based on their own unmet desires rather than any wrongdoing by Casey. Casey was honest about her boundaries, and the author should respect that. The fact that the author is trying to justify their actions by saying they're not trying to hurt her doesn't excuse the behavior. People have the right to set boundaries, and respecting those is fundamental in any interaction.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author's actions are disrespectful and inconsiderate. They prioritized their own needs and ego over Casey's comfort and the potential for a respectful relationship. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
