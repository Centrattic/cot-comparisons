We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author's story is that they had a first date, asked if they wanted to go back to his place, and the girl said no. He then lost interest and stopped responding, which he calls ghosting. He justifies it by saying he's not interested in continuing if there's no chance for sex, and he's upset about the money spent. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the social norms here. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. The author is using the girl's refusal to have sex as a reason to cut her off completely. But is that acceptable? The girl said she wanted to take things slow and build a relationship, which is a valid personal choice. The author, on the other hand, seems to have entered the date with a specific goal in mind, and when that wasn't met, he lost interest. That might indicate a mismatch in expectations. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as disrespectful because he's dismissing someone else's boundaries and decisions. People have different values and timelines for intimacy, and respecting that is important. By ghosting, he's not communicating his feelings, which is considerate. The fact that he's focusing on the money spent might also come across as shallow. \n\nHowever, it's also true that people have different standards for what they want in a relationship. If the author is clear about needing physical intimacy and the girl isn't on board, maybe he's not at fault for not wanting to continue. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014could still be problematic regardless of his motivations.\n\nSo, balancing both perspectives: the author's actions are hurtful and not respectful of the girl's boundaries, so he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
