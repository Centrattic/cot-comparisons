We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author directly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, zoned out during the date, and after that, only responded minimally to her texts, effectively ghosting her. The author justifies this by saying he lost interest because he spent money and didn't get what he wanted, but he claims he's not trying to hurt her.\n\nNow, the question is whether this makes the author the asshole. Let's break it down. Ghosting someone usually means cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The key factors here are consent, respect, and communication. \n\nThe author approached the situation by being direct about his intentions, which is okay if both parties are on the same page. However, when she said no, he didn't respect her boundaries. Instead of acknowledging her decision and discussing it, he disengaged and ghosted her. This is problematic because it's not about the money he spent, which is a red flag\u2014he's treating the date as a transactional experience rather than valuing her as a person. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for losing interest is based on his own expectations not being met, not considering her feelings or the mutual respect needed in a relationship. Ghosting is generally considered rude and disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The author's actions show a lack of empathy and consideration for Casey's autonomy and feelings. \n\nEven though he might not have intended to hurt her, the act of ghosting after she said no is still hurtful. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect, which he failed to uphold here. So, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
