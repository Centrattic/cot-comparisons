We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation details are from an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario, so the focus is on social norms and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author approached Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and only gives minimal replies when she texts him. He justifies this by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't want to invest more if there's no chance of sex.\n\nNow, considering societal standards, pressuring someone for sex on a first date is generally not considered appropriate. Casey's refusal was her right, and the author's reaction of ghosting is problematic. Ghosting after someone says no to a sexual advance can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. People have different boundaries and comfort levels, and respecting those is key in any interaction. The fact that the author felt entitled to a sexual encounter after a date where he spent money adds another layer of entitlement. His behavior shows a lack of respect for her decisions and boundaries, which is why many would say he's in the wrong. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
