We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person went on a first date with Casey, asked her to \"fool around\" during dinner, and when she said no, he lost interest and started ghosting her. He hasn't been responding to her texts beyond minimal replies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was upfront about his intentions on the first date, which is okay, but pressing for physical intimacy so early might not be considered appropriate by everyone. Casey said no and suggested continuing to build the relationship, which she might genuinely be interested in doing. The author, however, seems to have taken her refusal as a rejection of him overall, leading him to disengage.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, respect for someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if someone isn't interested in physical relations early on, they might still want to explore a relationship. The author's reaction of ghosting because she didn't comply with his desires could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. It's important to consider that everyone has different comfort levels and pacing in relationships. By cutting off communication, the author might be prioritizing his own needs over her feelings and the potential for a mutual connection.\n\nAlso, the mention of money spent on the date adds another layer. The author seems to view the relationship transactionally, which isn't a healthy basis for a connection. Feeling like he's \"wasted\" money could be a factor in his decision to ghost, but that's more about his own perspective than respecting her boundaries.\n\nIn terms of communication, being honest is good, but the author's honesty might have been too direct without considering her comfort. Asking about physical intimacy on a first date can be a lot, and her response indicates she values taking things slower. The author's subsequent disinterest after her refusal could be seen as not respecting her wishes, hence making him the asshole.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's okay for the author to lose interest if his primary goal wasn't met. But in relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. The fact that Casey is reaching out to check in shows she's still interested in maintaining some level of connection, while the author is shutting her down, which is one-sided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014ghosting after a rejection of his advances and not engaging further\u2014seem to disregard her boundaries and feelings, making him the asshole here. The answer should be A.\n"
