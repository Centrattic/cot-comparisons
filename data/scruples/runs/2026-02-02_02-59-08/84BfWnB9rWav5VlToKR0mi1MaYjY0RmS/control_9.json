We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting a girl after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations for physical intimacy, and he felt it wasn't worth continuing the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around relationships and expectations. The author approached the date with the intention of fooling around, which he made clear. The girl, Casey, expressed that she wanted to take things slower and that she liked him, but wasn't interested in physical activity that night. The author then ghosted her, not responding to her texts beyond minimal replies.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author felt disinterested, cutting off communication abruptly can be hurtful. The key here is whether the author respected Casey's boundaries and communicated his feelings properly. By not explaining his decision and disappearing, he didn't give her the courtesy of an open conversation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he lost interest after she said no, but that's his personal reaction. While people have different expectations in relationships, expecting physical intimacy on the first date isn't inherently wrong, but treating someone poorly for not meeting that expectation is. The author's decision to stop communicating entirely rather than expressing his feelings or giving a reason could be seen as dismissive and hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. Casey had shown interest over months, and the author's ghosting might have left her confused or hurt. Even if the author felt the date didn't go as planned, the way he ended the interaction is questionable. The initial request for intimacy was honest, but the follow-up actions were not respectful of her response.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have communicated that he was no longer interested in a respectful manner instead of ghosting. Ghosting is often considered a sign of disrespect because it avoids accountability. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more transparency and consideration for Casey's feelings.\n"
