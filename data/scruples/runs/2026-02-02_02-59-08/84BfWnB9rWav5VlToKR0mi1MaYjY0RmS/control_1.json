We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused his advances on the first date. The question is whether the author's actions make him the asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, who he thought had a crush on him for months. He directly asked her if they could go back to his place, and she said no, wanting to take things slower. The author then lost interest, didn't respond much after, and now is ghosting her. His reasoning is that since she didn't want to have sex on the first date, he's not interested anymore and doesn't want to invest more time/money without getting what he wants.\n\nThe key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and communication. The author's actions are a problem because he's ghosting someone for not meeting his expectations. It's important to acknowledge that everyone has different comfort levels and that respecting someone's decision is crucial. Ghosting is generally considered rude, especially if someone was honest about their intentions and the other party didn't reciprocate. The author's focus on his own loss of interest and money spent shows a lack of consideration for Casey's feelings and boundaries.\n\nAlso, consent is a mutual agreement, and just because someone is interested in you doesn't mean they're obligated to engage in sexual activity on the first date. The author's approach was to \"put all his cards on the table\" early, which might not align with what the other person is comfortable with. His decision to cut off communication after a single \"no\" is dismissive of her autonomy and preferences. \n\nIn many social contexts, pressuring someone for sex on the first date and then ending the relationship because they said no is not acceptable. The author's behavior could be seen as disrespectful, and ghosting makes it harder for the other person to understand what went wrong. There's also the issue of his mindset where he seems to view the date as a transactional exchange, which is problematic.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect Casey's boundaries, made a snap judgment about continuing the relationship based on her refusal, and chose to ghost instead of having an honest conversation about his expectations. His actions were disrespectful and hurtful, which aligns with being the asshole in this scenario.\n"
