We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting after the first date when the other person didn't reciprocate the physical intimacy he wanted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author asked Casey to go back to his place after the first date, she declined, said she's not like that, and wants to take things slow. He then zoned out during the date, didn't respond well, and after that, stopped communicating except for minimal replies. He justifies it by saying he lost interest because he wanted physical stuff and she wouldn't give in on the first date. He also mentions the money he spent as a factor.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Consent and respect are key here. The author approached the date with the intention of physical intimacy, which is okay, but when she said no, he didn't respect her boundaries. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if he's honest, cutting off communication abruptly is rude. Also, using the money spent as a reason is problematic because it implies entitlement, which isn't right. People should date without expecting something in return. The author's actions show a lack of respect for her autonomy and feelings, so he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
