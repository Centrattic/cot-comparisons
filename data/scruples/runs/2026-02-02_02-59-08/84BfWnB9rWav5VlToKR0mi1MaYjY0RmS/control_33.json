We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a first date with Casey, asked her to \"fool around\" on the first date, she said no, and then he ghosted her, losing interest after she didn't give him what he wanted. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author approached the date with the intention of physical intimacy from the start, which might not align with Casey's expectations. She indicated she wanted things to develop more slowly, so when he asked, she declined. The author then stopped responding to her messages, essentially cutting her off.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect in relationships. It's important to respect someone's boundaries. If someone says no to physical intimacy, especially on a first date, the appropriate response would be to respect that decision and continue building the relationship. The fact that the author lost interest and ghosted her because she didn't comply with his desire suggests a lack of respect for her autonomy and boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author's stated reason is that he doesn't want to spend more money on dates if there's a risk of not getting what he wants. This attitude implies that he's treating the relationship as a transactional exchange rather than a mutual connection based on respect and care. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't be about meeting one's own needs at the expense of the other person's comfort and boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. The author admitted he zoned out during the date after the rejection, which might have made Casey feel ignored or dismissed. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author no longer wants to pursue the relationship, he should at least communicate that clearly and respectfully.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author pressured for physical intimacy on a first date, didn't respect the boundary when it was set, and then abruptly cut off communication. These actions are disrespectful and inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
