We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no to fooling around on the first date. The author thought she had a crush on him and assumed she would say yes, but she said no and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving short replies.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are consent, communication, and respect. The author was clear about his intentions on the first date, which was to have sexual activity. Casey was honest that she wasn't interested in that yet and wanted to take things slowly. The author, however, decided to ghost her because his expectations weren't met. \n\nGhosting is generally considered disrespectful because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if the author felt disappointed, the right thing to do would be to communicate his feelings honestly and respectfully, even if he's not interested anymore. The fact that he spent money on the date and now feels it was a waste is his own issue, but using her refusal as a reason to ghost her is not her fault. Her decision to say no was valid and she had the right to set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's approach was pretty direct and maybe too forward for the early stages. Assuming that someone would agree to sex just because they've been flirting for a while isn't fair. People have different comfort levels and pacing. The author's loss of interest after she said no shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and decisions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong because he ghosted her without explanation, prioritizing his own needs over her feelings, and not respecting her decision. Therefore, he is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
