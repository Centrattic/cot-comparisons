We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The question is whether the author's actions make them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author approached Casey after knowing her for 8 months and flirting for 2. They went on a first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author asked directly if they wanted to go back to his place, and Casey said no, wanting to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and just gave minimal responses when she reached out. He cites losing interest because she didn't comply with his expectations and not wanting to spend more money on dates without getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, evaluating from a social and moral standpoint. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you cut off communication without explanation. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest, but that's his personal choice. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014could be seen as hurtful. Casey didn't do anything to deserve being ghosted; she expressed a desire to take things slowly, which is a valid and common boundary. The author's focus on his own desires and expenses (money spent on the date) as justifications might not be the most considerate perspective. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not violating any laws, but socially, being upfront about his lack of interest would have been more respectful. Ghosting is often considered a lack of respect for the other person's feelings. However, some might argue that he's free to pursue what he wants and if it doesn't align, it's not his fault. The key here is whether his actions were asshole-like. The term \"asshole\" in AITA contexts usually refers to someone who acted inconsiderately or without regard for others' feelings. \n\nThe author didn't respond to her texts, ignored her attempts to communicate, and didn't explain his disinterest. That's ghosting, which is typically frowned upon. Even if he lost interest, a more mature approach would be to have a conversation. So, while his feelings are valid, the way he handled it is where he's in the wrong. Answer A would be correct.\n"
