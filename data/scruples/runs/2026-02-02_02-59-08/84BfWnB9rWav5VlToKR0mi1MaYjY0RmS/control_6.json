We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't agree to have sex on the first date. The story is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) subreddit, so it's a real-life scenario where someone is seeking judgment from others.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author set up a date with Casey, who had a crush on him for months. During the date, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no, preferring to wait until the second date. The author then lost interest, became disengaged during the date, and after that, ignored her messages, effectively ghosting her. The author justifies this by saying he lost interest and didn't want to spend more money on dates without getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong here. The key points are: 1) The author was upfront about his intentions. 2) Casey declined, stating she wanted things to develop slower. 3) The author then ghosted her, losing interest after her refusal. \n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, respect for others' boundaries is crucial. Even if the author felt he had a \"done deal,\" Casey's decision to say no is her right. The fact that he lost interest and ghosted her because she didn't comply with his initial desire shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and her autonomy. Ghosting is generally frowned upon as it's abrupt and can hurt the other person. The author's focus on money and his own dissatisfaction over Casey's refusal also indicates a self-centered approach. \n\nAdditionally, the author's behavior of zoning out during the date after the rejection suggests poor communication and emotional immaturity. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding, not just transactional thinking based on personal gain (like wanting sex without investing time). \n\nIn many cultural contexts, pressuring someone for sex on the first date is considered inappropriate, and respecting her decision to wait is the right action. The author's reaction\u2014ghosting\u2014shows immaturity and a lack of respect for her decision. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
