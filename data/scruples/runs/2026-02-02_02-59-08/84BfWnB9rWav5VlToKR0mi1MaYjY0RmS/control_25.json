We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy, let's call him \"the author,\" met Casey over eight months ago, and they've been flirting for two of those. He thought she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. During dinner, he asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and said they should take it slow, that she likes him and wants things to develop. The author then zoned out, thinking about how he struck out, and after the date, he gave her a limp air hug. He hasn't responded to her texts, just minimal responses. The question is whether he's an a**hole for ghosting her because she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, let's think about consent and respect. The author approached her directly about wanting to have sex, and she declined. She made it clear she wanted to take things slow. The author's response was to lose interest and ghost her. Ghosting is cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. Even if he felt rejected, cutting her off completely without any communication is not respectful. He could have had a conversation to express his feelings, whether to end things or to talk about where they stand.\n\nAnother point is the pressure he put on her. Asking bluntly about sex on a first date can be seen as pressuring her, especially if he expected an \"easy sell\" because he thought she had a crush on him. He should have respected her boundaries and her decision to wait. The fact that he thought it was a \"done deal\" because of the rumors of her having feelings is problematic. He can't assume someone's feelings or actions just because there are rumors.\n\nThen there's the issue of how he handled the aftermath. Instead of being honest about his feelings (that he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him), he's ghosting her. Even if he's not interested anymore, he should communicate that respectfully. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and hurt.\n\nHe also mentions the money he spent on the date. Prioritizing money over her feelings and boundaries isn't a good reason to ghost. The cost shouldn't matter if the relationship isn't compatible. Also, expecting sexual activity in exchange for the date's cost is transactional and not healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different expectations in relationships. If he's looking for a casual relationship and she's not, that's a mismatch. But the problem here is how he handled the rejection. Ghosting isn't the solution. If he's clear that he wants a physical relationship and she's not interested, then maybe he shouldn't have pursued a date in the first place. But he did, and then reacted poorly when she didn't meet his expectations.\n\nSo overall, the author is in the wrong because he pressured her, didn't respect her boundaries, and then ghosted her instead of communicating his feelings. His actions were hurtful and not respectful of her decision.\n"
