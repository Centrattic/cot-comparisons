We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author went on a first date with Casey, which they both seemed to enjoy. The author asked directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which Casey declined, saying she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted to wait until the second date. The author then became disinterested, stopped communicating beyond minimal responses, and justified this by saying they lost interest because Casey didn't meet their expectations for physical intimacy. They also mention feeling like they wasted money on the date and not wanting to repeat it without getting what they wanted.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if someone loses interest, cutting off communication entirely is dismissive and inconsiderate. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing their own desires over Casey's feelings. Also, wanting someone primarily for physical intimacy from the start and being unwilling to pursue a relationship without immediate sex could be viewed as shallow. However, the author is upfront about their intentions, which could be seen as honest, even if it's not kind.\n\nCasey set boundaries by declining the request, which is her right. The author's response of ghosting doesn't respect her decision and might be seen as selfish. While people have different expectations, the way the author handled the rejection is problematic. The justification based on \"not wanting to waste money\" further emphasizes a transactional view of the date, which isn't respectful. \n\nIn relationships, communication and respect for the other person's boundaries are key. Ghosting after a rejection is not the right approach, regardless of personal feelings. The author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful towards Casey's autonomy, even if they feel they have a reason. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
