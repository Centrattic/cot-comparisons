We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. So the situation is that the author went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place to fool around, and she said no. He then lost interest, stopped replying, and is just giving minimal responses when she texts. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author approached Casey directly, which is pretty upfront. She had a crush on him for months, but she turned down his proposition. The author then ghosted her, not responding beyond one-word answers. \n\nNow, the key factors here are communication, respect, and mutual boundaries. The author's approach of being blunt might have been too direct for a first date. Asking someone to \"put out\" on the first date can be seen as pressuring them, especially if they're not comfortable with that. Casey's response that she wanted things to develop more slowly is a valid personal boundary. \n\nBy the author's own admission, he lost interest after she said no. But the way he's handling it\u2014ghosting and not communicating\u2014could be considered disrespectful. Even if he's honest about his feelings, it's important to communicate that clearly and respectfully rather than cutting off all contact without explanation. Ghosting often leaves the other person confused and hurt, which isn't ideal regardless of the reason.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the money spent on the date, which adds a transactional element. However, the main issue here is about mutual respect and consent. The fact that he felt it was an \"easy sell\" suggests he might have been more focused on his own desires than considering her comfort and boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social norms, expecting someone to have sex on the first date isn't a universal standard. People have different comfort levels, and respecting those levels is part of healthy relationships. By ghosting instead of having an open conversation about his expectations and disappointment, the author isn't handling the situation maturely. \n\nSo, while the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue if his initial expectations weren't met, the way he's handling the situation\u2014ghosting without clear communication\u2014is where he's at fault. It's important to be honest but also kind in such situations. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for ghosting instead of communicating respectfully.\n"
