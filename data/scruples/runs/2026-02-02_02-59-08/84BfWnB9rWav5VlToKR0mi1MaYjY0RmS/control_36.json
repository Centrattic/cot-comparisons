We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, and he asked her to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight,\" saying she wasn't like that and wanted things to develop on the second date. The author then zoned out, felt like he \"struck out,\" and started ghosting, responding only minimally to her texts. His reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him sex on the first date, and he doesn't want to spend more money without that outcome.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. However, the situation here is nuanced. The author was clear about his intentions upfront, and she was clear about her boundaries. He admits he expected her to agree but was disappointed when she didn't, leading him to lose interest. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while he's free to have his preferences, respecting the other person's autonomy is key. She expressed her boundaries, and he's choosing to disengage because her boundaries didn't meet his expectations. That could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. However, some might argue that if he's not interested in a relationship where she's not willing to meet his needs, then moving on isn't inherently wrong, though the way he's ghosting is still inconsiderate. \n\nBut the main issue is that he's ghosting her because she didn't comply with his expectations. If the question is about being in the wrong, it's more about how he's handling the situation rather than his right to prefer sexual relations early on. Ghosting is generally frowned upon regardless of the reason, so the author's actions are inconsiderate. However, the underlying issue is his reaction to her refusal. \n\nIn many perspectives, respecting someone's no is important, and if he's not willing to respect her boundaries, that's where the wrong lies. Ghosting exacerbates the problem by being abrupt. So the answer would lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and is cutting her off rudely because she didn't meet his expectations.\n"
