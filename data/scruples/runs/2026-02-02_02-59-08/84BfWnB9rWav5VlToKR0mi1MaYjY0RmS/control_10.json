We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer set up a date with Casey, and during the date, he directly asked her if they could \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight,\" and suggested waiting until the second date. He then zoned out, felt like he \"struck out,\" and later ghosted her, not responding beyond minimal replies. His reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted, and he doesn't want to spend more money on a second date if there's a risk of not getting sex again.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The writer's main issue is that he expected physical intimacy on the first date and was disappointed when she didn't comply. However, respecting someone's boundaries is important. By asking bluntly if they could fool around, he put pressure on her, and she clearly stated her limits. Instead of respecting her decision, he ghosted her, which is dismissive and hurtful.\n\nEthically, the problem here is that he didn't respect her decision and then cut off communication. Even if he felt disappointed, a better approach would be to communicate his feelings honestly but respectfully. Ghosting is generally seen as the asshole move because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The writer's actions were impulsive and disrespectful, so he's likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
