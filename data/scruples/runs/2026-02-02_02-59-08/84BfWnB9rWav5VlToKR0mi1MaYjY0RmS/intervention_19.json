We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking for an opinion based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author went on a first date with Casey. They asked her directly if they could fool around, and she said no, wanting to take things slower. The author then ghosted her after that. The key points here are consent, respect, and communication.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't reciprocate the immediate physical intimacy he wanted. But the problem here is that Casey had been showing interest for months, and the author assumed she would say yes. When she said no, he didn't respect her boundaries and decided to cut her off completely. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, as it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the money spent on the date, which seems to be a factor in his decision. This could imply that he viewed the date as a transactional exchange, which isn't healthy. Respecting someone's autonomy and decisions should take precedence over any financial considerations.\n\nThe fact that Casey continued to reach out and he ignored her makes it worse. Even if he felt his interest was gone, a polite response explaining his feelings would have been kinder. Ghosting is often seen as disrespectful because it doesn't allow for a proper ending or explanation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were dismissive of Casey's boundaries and feelings. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
