We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author met Casey 8 months ago, and they've been flirting for about 2 months. There were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight\" and mentioned she wasn't like that, but that she liked him and wanted to take it slow. The author then zoned out during the rest of the date, focused on not getting what he wanted. After the date, he didn't respond to her texts beyond minimal replies. The author is ghosting her because she didn't agree to sex on the first date, and he's upset about the money he spent. He claims he's not trying to hurt her, just lost interest because he thought it was an \"easy sell.\"\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author approached the date with the primary goal of getting into a sexual relationship. He didn't build a connection; he asked for sex right away. When she declined, he lost interest. Ghosting is a form of emotional manipulation or avoidance. By cutting off communication without explanation, he's being disrespectful to her feelings. She made it clear she wanted to take things slower, which is a valid boundary. The author's main issue is that he didn't get what he wanted, so he's devaluing the relationship. Also, his focus on the money spent is selfish. Relationships shouldn't be transactional, especially not in this way. He's treating her as a means to an end rather than respecting her as a person with her own values and boundaries. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, especially after a first date. The author's actions show a lack of respect for her decision and his own immaturity in handling rejection. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
