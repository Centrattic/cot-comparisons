We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she said no to sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author went on a first date, asked the girl to go back to his place, and she refused. He then lost interest and stopped communicating. The key issue here is whether it's acceptable to ghost someone for not meeting your expectations regarding physical intimacy.\n\nThe woman set a boundary by saying \"no, not tonight\" and expressed a desire to build the relationship. The author, instead of respecting her decision and continuing to get to know her, decided to cut contact. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and unheard. Even if the author felt disappointed, walking away without explaining or maintaining communication is dismissive of her feelings and her right to make choices about her body and relationship pace.\n\nFinancial considerations shouldn't dictate the value of a relationship. The author's focus on the money spent might indicate a transactional view of the relationship, which isn't healthy. Relationships should be about mutual respect and emotional connection, not about expectations of immediate rewards. \n\nAdditionally, the author's blunt approach and subsequent withdrawal don't show emotional maturity. It's important to communicate clearly if expectations aren't met, rather than cutting off contact. The woman's attempts to reach out after the date show her willingness to continue the relationship, but the author's ghosting hurts her and is disrespectful.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are hurtful and disrespectful, making him the asshole here. So the answer is A.\n"
