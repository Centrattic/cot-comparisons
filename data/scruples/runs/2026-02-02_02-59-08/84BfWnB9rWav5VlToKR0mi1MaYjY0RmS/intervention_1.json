We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no on the first date. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and Casey have been flirting for two months, and there were rumors she had feelings for him for five to six months. They went on a date, which included dinner and a movie. The author was upfront and asked if they could go back to his place to fool around. He thought it was a given because of the rumors, but she said no, not tonight, and that she wanted things to develop. \n\nNow, the author lost interest because she refused and hasn't replied to her texts. He ghosted her because he feels like he wasted money on the date and doesn't see the point in continuing if there's no chance of getting into a physical relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nI know that in relationships and dating, mutual respect is key. The author asked bluntly for sex on the first date, which might be a dealbreaker for some people. Casey declined, which is her right, and the author's response was to ghost her. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. However, the author claims he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest.\n\nBut is it wrong to lose interest? People do have the right to their preferences. However, the way he handled it by ghosting is unkind. Even if he's not interested anymore, a respectful approach would be to explain his feelings instead of ignoring her. Additionally, the fact that he brings up the financial aspect (\"spent a fair bit of change\") could be seen as using money as justification for his actions, which might not be valid. People should be able to make decisions about their bodies and relationships without being judged or penalized financially.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that because there were rumors of her having feelings, she would agree to his request. That's a poor assumption to make. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, and her saying no shouldn't be a reason to cut her off. The author's reaction seems more about his own unmet expectations than respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of consent and respect, the author's actions after her refusal are where the issue lies. Ghosting is a form of emotional manipulation and can be hurtful. Even if he doesn't want to pursue a relationship anymore, being honest but kind in his communication would be more appropriate. \n\nSo putting it all together, while the author may have had his own expectations, respecting Casey's decision and handling the situation with communication rather than ghosting is the right approach. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
