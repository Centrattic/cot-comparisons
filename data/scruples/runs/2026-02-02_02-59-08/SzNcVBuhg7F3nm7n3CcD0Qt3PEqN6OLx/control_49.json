He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake, and the author joked that it looked like Play-doh, causing their daughter and others to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intention. The author said it was an accident, but they had a history of teasing their brother about veganism. Even if they meant it as a joke, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. Was the author's comment appropriate? They mentioned they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately, but this incident shows a lapse.\n\nAlso, the daughter is four, so she's innocent. The author's reaction might have influenced the family's actions. The brother was proud of his creation, so having it treated as a toy could be hurtful. The author might have crossed a line by not checking their comment, especially knowing the brother's feelings about his veganism.\n\nBut maybe it was a harmless joke gone wrong. The author didn't intend to ruin the brunch. However, the outcome was that the brother's effort was disrespected. So, the author's actions led to that outcome, even if unintentionally. In terms of responsibility, they might share some blame for not thinking through the consequences of their comment.\n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They should have considered how their joke might affect their brother and avoided making the comment in front of the child. Even if it was accidental, they could have corrected the mistake immediately instead of letting the family play with it.\n"
