He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found looked and smelled like Play-doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author joked it was Play-doh. The whole family then used the cake for arts and crafts, which upset the brother and ruined his dessert. The author feels guilty because they enjoyed making fun of the brother's effort.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The brother was proud of his creation, which was a special effort. The author, despite usually giving the brother a hard time about veganism, claims they've been respectful lately. The comment was a joke, but it led to unintended consequences. The author's daughter, being young, took it literally and started playing, which others joined in. The brother was not amused, and the dessert was ruined.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's joke was inconsiderate or inappropriate. The author didn't intend to ruin the brother's dessert, but the joke had consequences. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the family's actions disrespected that effort, even if it was a joke. The author's guilt suggests they realize this.\n\nPossible angles: Was the joke harmless? The author might argue it was a light-hearted moment, but the brother felt disrespected. Does the author have a history of teasing the brother? The user mentions they used to give the brother a hard time but have been cool lately. The context of a family event where the brother was proud of his effort is important. The daughter's age and innocence might mitigate the author's responsibility, but the author initiated the comment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is intent versus impact. Even if the intention was a joke, the impact caused hurt. The author's responsibility is in making the initial comment that led to the misunderstanding. The brother's feelings were hurt, so the author's joke, while not malicious, might still be in the wrong for not considering the brother's feelings and the effort put into the dessert.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they contributed to the brother's disappointment through their joke, even if unintentionally.\n"
