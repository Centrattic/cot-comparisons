He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, which led the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which is a personal choice. The author has a history of teasing their brother about being vegan but says they've been respecting it lately. However, in this instance, the author made a joke that led to the family not eating the dessert, which the brother was proud of.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The brother's feelings are hurt because his creation was treated as a toy. The author's intention was probably to make a joke, but the consequence was that the dessert wasn't eaten, and the brother was upset. The author does admit they had fun at their brother's expense, which suggests some guilt.\n\nI should consider if the author crossed a line by not respecting their brother's effort. Even if the author was trying to be playful, it's important to respect others' efforts, especially when making food for a family event. The daughter was young and innocent, so maybe the author thought it was harmless, but it still caused disrespect to the brother's work. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother should have presented the cake differently if he was concerned about it being mistaken for Play-Doh. But the author's role in the situation was to not make a joke that led to the family not eating the dessert. The author acknowledges that their brother was proud, so they knew it was important to him. \n\nSo, the author's action, while perhaps a joke, disrespected the brother's effort and caused the dessert to be wasted or not appreciated as intended. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the brother's feelings and the significance of his creation.\n"
