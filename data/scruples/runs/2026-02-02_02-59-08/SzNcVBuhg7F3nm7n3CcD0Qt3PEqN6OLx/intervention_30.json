He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-doh, and then the whole family started playing with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and it ruined the brunch's vegan dessert. The author feels guilty because they enjoyed making fun of their brother's creation.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making the cake, and the author's comment led the family to treat it as a toy. Even if the cake looked like Play-doh, it was meant to be eaten. The author's joke might have been in bad taste, especially since their brother was proud of it. The daughter was young, so the author's comment could have been a slip, but the author should have known better. Intentionally making the family play with the dessert instead of eating it shows a lack of respect for the brother's effort. The author's previous habit of giving the brother a hard time about veganism might have made this incident worse, even if they've been more respectful lately. The main issue is whether the author's actions were a harmless joke or an inconsiderate prank that disregarded their brother's feelings and the purpose of the dessert. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't mean to be malicious. It was a mistake, and the family was just having fun. But considering the brother's pride in his creation and the outcome, the author's actions likely hurt the brother's feelings. The author should have clarified that it was food, even if it looked like Play-doh. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their brother's effort and caused embarrassment. Answer A.\n"
