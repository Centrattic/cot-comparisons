He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, who usually teases the brother about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The family then ended up using it for arts and crafts, which upset the brother.\n\nThe main points here are intent and consequences. The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch, but their comment caused the child to treat the cake as a toy. Even though they were just joking around, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The brother was proud of his dessert, and the family's actions might have made him feel disrespected.\n\nThe author mentions feeling guilty about having fun at their brother's expense. That suggests they recognize the impact of their actions. However, the key issue is whether they should have known better. Since the brother was proud of his creation, the author's joke, especially in front of a child, might have been inconsiderate. The child's question was innocent, but the author's response led to a situation that ruined the intended purpose of the dessert.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was the one who made the initial joke, which set the whole thing in motion. Even if others joined in, the root cause was the author's comment. So, while it might not be a malicious act, it was a thoughtless one that disregarded the brother's feelings and efforts. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words would affect the brother and the situation.\n"
