He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh.\n\nFirst, the brother made a vegan cake, which is a thoughtful gesture. The writer made a joke about it looking like Play-Doh, which led the kids and family to actually use it as Play-Doh instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his creation, but the joke backfired, causing him embarrassment and ruining his dessert.\n\nThe writer mentions that they usually give their brother a hard time about his veganism but have been respecting it lately. However, in this moment, they made a joke that had consequences. The main issue here is whether the joke was inconsiderate, especially since the brother had put effort into making the dessert. \n\nOn one hand, the writer's intention might have been harmless humor, and the family ended up having fun with it. But on the other hand, the brother's effort was wasted, and the writer might have overstepped by not considering how the joke would affect him. The writer also feels guilty about the situation, which suggests they recognize the potential harm.\n\nBut was it an accident? The writer didn't mean to ruin the dessert; they just made a comment that the kids took literally. However, as a parent, they should have been more mindful of their words, especially around young children. The four-year-old might not understand the context of the joke and could act on it. The writer's comment led to a situation that embarrassed the brother and ruined his contribution to the meal. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer is the one who made the initial comment, which directly led to the family interacting with the cake as if it were Play-Doh. Even if it was a joke, they might be in the wrong for not foreseeing the consequences. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the writer's guilt indicates they see the issue. \n\nBut maybe the brother could have presented the cake differently or explained it more. However, the writer's role in initiating the joke is central here. So, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards the writer being in the wrong because they made a joke that had unintended negative consequences, especially when the brother had put effort into preparing the dessert. The writer's comment was the catalyst for the situation, so they might be at fault.\n"
