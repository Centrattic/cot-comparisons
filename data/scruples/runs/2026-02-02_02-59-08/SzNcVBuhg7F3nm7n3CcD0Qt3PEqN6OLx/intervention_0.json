He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author jokingly telling their daughter that their brother's vegan cake is Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author found resembles Play-Doh. The author's daughter asked what it was, and the author responded with \"It's Play-Doh,\" which led to the family playing with it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author was making fun of their brother's veganism, even though they mention they've been respecting it lately. The brother was proud of his creation, and the joke ruined the intended use of the dessert. The author admits to feeling guilty, which suggests they see some fault in their actions.\n\nNow, considering intent. The author didn't mean to cause harm, but the joke had a negative effect on the brother. The brother's effort was disrespected, even if unintentionally. The family's response (playing with the dessert) was a result of the author's comment. Even if it was a joke, the author should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into the dessert. \n\nAlso, the daughter is only four, so the author might have thought it was harmless. But the brother's feelings and the effort into making the cake were real. The author's history of giving the brother a hard time about veganism adds context; even if they've been better lately, the joke might still be a trigger.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother might have had a sense of humor about it, but the story says he wasn't amused. The author's guilt and the brother's displeasure indicate that the joke was inappropriate in this context. The author could have chosen not to make the comment, especially knowing the brother was proud of his dessert.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions, while maybe not malicious, were inconsiderate and disrespectful to the brother's efforts. The outcome ruined the brother's contribution to the meal, which is a valid reason for the author feeling guilty. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
