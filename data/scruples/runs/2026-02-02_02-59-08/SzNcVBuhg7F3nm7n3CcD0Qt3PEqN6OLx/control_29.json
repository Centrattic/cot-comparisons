He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found to look like Play-Doh and even joked about it. The daughter then started playing with the cake, and the rest of the family joined in, which upset the brother and ruined the brunch's vegan part.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The key points are the intent and the consequences. The author said they \"blurted out\" that it was Play-Doh, which was a joke. The daughter is four, so she's innocent and easily influenced. The author didn't outright lie but made a joke that led the child to believe it. Then, the family started using the cake as a toy, which the brother didn't like. The cake was meant to be eaten, so the actions prevented that. \n\nThe author mentions they've been respectful of the brother's veganism recently, but in this case, their comment caused a problem. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's playtime with it probably hurt his feelings. The author feels guilty because they enjoyed the joke. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if it was a joke, the author didn't verify if the cake was safe for Play-Doh (which it's not, being a dessert). The joke led to misuse of the food, which the uncle had put effort into making. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the consequences of their words, especially with a child involved. They also didn't apologize or correct the misunderstanding quickly. \n\nBut some might argue it was a harmless misunderstanding and a family moment that everyone found funny except the brother. However, since the brother had a specific intention (vegan dessert) and his effort was wasted, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they contributed to the uncle's distress and the cake wasn't safe to play with.\n"
