He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a family brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, in a moment of humor, told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author is feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making the cake, which the author has a history of teasing about his veganism. Even though the author mentions they've been respectful lately, this incident happened. The author's comment led to the family not eating the dessert, which was the brother's contribution. \n\nThe author's intention was probably a joke, but the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Factors to consider: was the joke appropriate? Did the author know it would ruin the dessert? The daughter is four, so maybe the author didn't foresee the extent of the reaction. However, the author did say it was Play-Doh, which led the child to play with it. The rest of the family joined in, which the author might have encouraged, given they mention they had fun making fun of the brother.\n\nThe brother's feelings are hurt because his creation was not respected. The author's past teasing might have contributed to this, even if they've been respectful lately. The author's guilt suggests they feel responsible. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is intent vs. impact. The author's intent was a joke, but the impact was damaging to the brother's feelings and the event. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the consequences of their comment, especially given their past behavior. Alternatively, the brother might be expected to have presented the cake in a way that's clearly edible, but the situation is family, and sometimes humor is involved. However, the cake's appearance was the brother's choice, and the author's comment led to the misuse of it. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because, despite the humor, they directly told the child it was Play-Doh, leading to the family not eating it. The brother's effort was undermined, and the author's joke, even if well-meaning, had negative consequences. So the answer is A.\n"
