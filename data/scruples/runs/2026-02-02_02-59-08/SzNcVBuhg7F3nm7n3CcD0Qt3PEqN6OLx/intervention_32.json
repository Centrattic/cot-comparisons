He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author made their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his dessert, and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author intended to be harmful. The brother made the cake with pride, and the author's comment was a joke. But the daughter took it literally and the family followed suit. The author seems to feel guilty now, but the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nIntent matters. The author says they've been cool with the brother's veganism but have a history of teasing. The comment was spontaneous, but it led to unintended consequences. The brother was upset because his creation wasn't respected. Even if it was a joke, the author should have considered the brother's feelings. Kids don't understand sarcasm, so the comment could backfire. The author's humor caused the family to mock the brother's effort, which is inconsiderate. The answer is likely A, but maybe there's a nuance. Did the author know it looked like Play-Doh? They thought it did, but maybe they didn't expect the reaction. Still, as an adult, they should have foreseen the possibility of the kid taking it seriously and the brother being upset. So, the author is in the wrong for not considering the consequences of their words on the brother's feelings and the overall family dynamic. Answer A.\n"
