He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan dessert, which the author found looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author joked that it was Play-Doh. The family then played with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother and ruined the vegan part of the brunch.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a joke that led to the cake being treated as a toy, not a food. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions disappointed him. The author now feels guilty, especially because they had been trying to be more respectful of the brother's veganism.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But why? Well, the author's comment was a joke, but it had real consequences. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the family's actions undermined that. The author's intention might have been to be playful, but the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author might be at fault for not considering how the joke would affect the brother, especially since they had a history of teasing him about his veganism.\n\nHowever, the author mentions they've been respectful lately, so maybe they didn't mean to be malicious. But the outcome was still negative. Is the author responsible for the daughter's actions and the family's subsequent behavior? It's possible. The initial comment was the catalyst. Even if it was a joke, leading the family to play with the cake instead of eating it might be seen as dismissive of the brother's effort and intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother's dessert looked so much like Play-Doh that it was an honest mistake. But the author had the knowledge that it was a dessert, and by joking about it, they influenced the family's perception. The brother was there, proud of his creation, so the author should have been more careful with their words, especially in front of a child.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intention vs. impact. The author's intention was probably to be funny, but the impact was hurtful. Since they later feel guilty, it shows they recognize the negative outcome. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the family's actions ruined the purpose of the dessert. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for not considering the consequences of their joke and for undermining the brother's efforts.\n"
