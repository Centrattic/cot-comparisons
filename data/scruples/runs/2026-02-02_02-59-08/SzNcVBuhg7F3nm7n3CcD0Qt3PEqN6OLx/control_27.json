He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's brother made a vegan cake, which is bright green and mung bean-based. The author thought it looked and smelled like Play-doh. When their daughter asked what it was, the author told her it was Play-doh. This led the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother. The author is feeling guilty about the fun they had at their brother's expense.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The brother put effort into making a dessert for the family, and the author made a joke about it. The daughter took the joke at face value, leading to everyone playing with the cake. The brother was clearly upset because his creation wasn't eaten. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author admits they have a history of teasing the brother about his veganism but have been more respectful recently. However, in this case, they made a joke that led to the cake being used as a toy, which ruined the brother's intended meal addition. \n\nI need to think about intent and consequences. The author didn't mean to be malicious but had a history of teasing. The daughter was young and easily influenced, so the author's comment directly caused the misunderstanding. The family's actions were a direct result of the author's statement. Even if it was a joke, the author should have been more careful, especially considering the effort the brother put into making the dessert. The brother was proud of his creation, so the joke likely hurt his feelings, even if it wasn't meant to be mean. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's intentions were playful and not to deliberately harm. The daughter's action was innocent, and the family just joined in. The brother's reaction might be seen as sensitive. But on the other hand, the author's comment was the catalyst for the entire incident. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and the potential outcome of making such a joke, especially with a young child present. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's words led to the cake not being used as intended. Even if it was a joke, the author has a duty to be respectful, especially in a family setting. The brother's efforts were dismissed, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of intent. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the mistake, which might indicate they were in the wrong. \n\nSo, the factors here are intent, the history of teasing, the impact on the brother, and the author's responsibility as an adult to foresee the consequences. While the author might not have intended to be cruel, the outcome was harmful to the brother's feelings and the family meal. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for making the joke without considering the potential consequences.\n"
