He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to use it for arts and crafts instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author initially gave him a hard time about. Even though they've been respectful lately, the author's joke here seems to have backfired. By calling it Play-Doh, they caused confusion and the dessert wasn't eaten as intended. The brother was not amused, and the event ruined the vegan addition to the brunch. \n\nThe author might argue that it was a harmless joke, but considering the effort the brother put in, it's respectful to take it seriously. Kids might not understand the context, but the parents should have been more cautious. The author's comment started the chain reaction, so they bear some responsibility. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the family's meal was disrupted. Even if it was accidental, the author's action directly led to the issue. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for not considering the impact of their joke on their brother's feelings and the event's outcome.\n"
