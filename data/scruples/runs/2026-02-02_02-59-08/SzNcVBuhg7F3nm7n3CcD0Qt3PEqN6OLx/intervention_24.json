He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author's daughter asked what the cake was, and the author jokingly said it was Play-Doh. The author wasn't trying to be malicious, but maybe they knew the brother put effort into it. However, the brother was proud of his creation, so the joke backfired. \n\nIs there a violation of social norms? Telling a child it's Play-Doh when it's actually food might be considered a prank, which can be seen as inconsiderate. The brother's effort was wasted, and the family didn't eat the dessert. The author admits they had fun making fun of their brother's veganism, which might indicate a lack of respect even if it's a joke.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices. But the action still caused embarrassment and wasted the effort. The key here is whether the joke was appropriate. Kids can be honest, but the parent's role is to guide them. The author's response led to a family interaction that undermined the brother's contribution. \n\nAlso, the brother's feelings are important. Even if the author meant no harm, the result was that the brother's dessert wasn't appreciated. The author should have considered the consequences. So, while the intention wasn't malicious, the outcome was hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
