He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake for Christmas brunch, and the author joked that it looked like Play-doh. The kids and the family then started playing with it as if it were Play-doh instead of eating it, which upset the brother. The author is now feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which shows he cares. The author's intention was to make a joke, not to be malicious. However, the joke led to the brother's creation being treated as a toy, which might have made him feel disrespected. The author mentions they've been cool with the brother's veganism lately, so this might be an exception.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't intentionally want to mock the dessert, but their joke caused unintended harm. Even if it was a joke, the result was that the brother's effort was undermined. The family's reaction, while playful, might have made the brother feel his effort wasn't appreciated. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the impact of their actions. \n\nHowever, the brother's choice to make a colorful cake might have invited some playful comments. The author's daughter was just being innocent, and the family followed along. But the key is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since they didn't have ill intent, but the outcome was hurtful, it's a mix. \n\nIn some cases, humor can be a gray area. If the author knew the brother might be sensitive about his veganism, then the joke might be inappropriate. But the author says they've respected his choices lately. Still, the brother's pride was in his dessert, and the joke undermined that. The author's role in starting the joke is central here. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if it was a joke, the author's action led to the brother's creation being disrespected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their joke would affect the brother's feelings about his effort.\n"
