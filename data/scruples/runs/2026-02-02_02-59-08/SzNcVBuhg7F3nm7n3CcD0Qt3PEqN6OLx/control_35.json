He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter and the family think the vegan cake was Play-Doh.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which he was proud of. The author, despite respecting the brother's dietary choices, made a joke that led to the family treating the dessert as a toy. The key points here are the intention and the consequence. The author says they \"blurted out\" the joke, implying it was spontaneous. The brother wasn't amused, and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition. The author feels guilty because they enjoyed making fun of it.\n\nSo, considering the brother's effort and pride, the author's joke, even if accidental, directly led to the cake not being eaten. The family's reaction might have been influenced by the child's innocence, but the author started the chain by making the comment. While the author has been respectful of the brother's choices, this incident shows a lack of consideration. The humor here is a bit mean-spirited, especially when involving a child. The family's decision to play with the cake instead of eating it was a result of the author's comment, so the responsibility lies with them. Even if it was a joke, it's not appropriate to mock someone's efforts, especially in a family setting. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
