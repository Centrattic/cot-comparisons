He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, and the whole family ended up using it as craft material instead of eating it. The brother was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author says they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately, but they made a joke that backfired. The brother was proud of his creation, so the author's comment might have been inconsiderate. Even if it was a joke, leading the family to play with the cake instead of eating it could be seen as dismissive of the brother's effort. The daughter is young, so her question was innocent, but the author's response set off the chain reaction.\n\nAlso, the brother's effort to prepare a vegan dessert was undermined. The author admits feeling guilty about the fun they had at the brother's expense. The key points here are respect for others' efforts and the impact of jokes in family settings. Even if it was an accident, the author's initial comment was the catalyst. So, while maybe not malicious, the author's action caused the brother distress and wasted his effort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
