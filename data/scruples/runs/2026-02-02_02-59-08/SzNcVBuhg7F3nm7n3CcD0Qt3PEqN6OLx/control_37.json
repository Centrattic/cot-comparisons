He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for making their daughter think their brother's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The author, who has a history of teasing their brother about veganism, told their daughter it was Play-Doh. The daughter and family then used the cake as playdough, which upset the brother.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because they had fun making fun of the brother's effort. The key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's comment was a joke, but it led to the brother's creation being destroyed. Even though the author didn't mean to ruin the cake on purpose, their action (telling the daughter it's Play-Doh) directly caused the family to use it as a toy. The brother was proud of his dessert, so having it treated as a toy would be hurtful. The author's teasing history adds to the context. Even if it was accidental, the author's words and actions led to the outcome. So, they might be in the wrong because they should have considered the consequences of their joke, especially knowing their brother's feelings about his dietary choices. On the other hand, it was a mistake, and they might not have intended to be malicious. But the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the author's action was the catalyst, they might share some responsibility. So, probably answer A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
