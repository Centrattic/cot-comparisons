He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author made their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother made a vegan cake, which he was proud of. The author, who has a history of teasing the brother about veganism but has recently been more respectful, made a comment to their daughter that the cake looked like Play-Doh. The daughter then started playing with it, and the rest of the family joined in, which upset the brother and ruined his dessert.\n\nNow, considering intent. The author didn't mean to directly mock the brother, but their comment led to the cake being treated as a toy. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the author's action caused him distress. Even if it was a joke, the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author might feel guilty, as mentioned, which indicates some awareness of wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, the brother himself chose to make a cake that looked like Play-Doh. Maybe that's a stretch, but the appearance was so similar that it led to confusion. The author's comment was playful, but with a young child present, the reaction was inevitable. The family joined in, and the brother was upset. The key here is whether the author should have foreseen the outcome. They did mention it looked like Play-Doh, which they've given the brother a hard time about before. Even if they were trying to be humorous, the result was negative for the brother.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it was a harmless joke that went too far. The brother's choice of ingredients and presentation might have contributed to the confusion. But the author initiated the joke with the child, which set the whole thing in motion. The brother was proud of his creation, so seeing it played with instead of eaten would be hurtful. The author's action, even if unintentional, caused emotional distress to a family member. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n\nAlternatively, others might say that the brother's dessert was so similar in appearance to Play-Doh that it was bound to cause confusion, and the author's comment was just an innocent observation. But the author's statement directly led to the family playing with it, so they bear some responsibility. The fact that they later felt guilty suggests they recognize the impact of their actions. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation might have been a misunderstanding, the author's comment was the catalyst. They could have chosen not to make the joke, especially knowing the brother's pride in his vegan efforts. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
