He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that at a family Christmas brunch, the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author (AITA) joked that it was Play-Doh, which led the whole family to play with it instead of eating it, and the brother was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother went to the effort of making a vegan dessert, which he was proud of. The author has a history of teasing the brother about his veganism but claims they've been respecting it lately. The joke was made in front of a 4-year-old, who then started playing with the cake. The entire family joined in, which ruined the brother's dessert.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and impact. The author's intent was probably a joke, but the impact was that the brother's effort was wasted, and the family didn't eat the dessert. The author might not have intended to be mean, but the result was that the brother was upset. Even if the author didn't mean to be malicious, the action caused harm. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling guilty about the fun they had making fun of the brother. This guilt suggests that they recognize the inappropriateness of their actions. The fact that the joke was made in front of a child might be a factor too, as the child was the one who started playing with it, which then spread to the rest of the family. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's dessert might not have been appealing, and the author's reaction could be seen as a light-hearted moment. However, the brother was there to share his creation, and the family's reaction could have been hurtful. The line between a joke and being disrespectful can be thin. Since the author's comment directly led to the family not eating the dessert, they do bear some responsibility. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's joke, while perhaps not malicious, did lead to the brother's dish being treated as a toy. The author's responsibility is in making the initial comment that set off the chain of events. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
