He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-doh, and the author joked that it was Play-doh to their daughter, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother went to the effort of making a vegan dessert, which he was proud of. The author, despite giving the brother a hard time about veganism in the past, now claims to respect his choices. However, the author made a joke that led to the family mistreating the dessert. The main issue here is whether the joke was inconsiderate or crossed a line.\n\nThe brother's effort and feelings are important. Even if the author meant it as a harmless joke, the outcome was that the brother's creation was not respected. The daughter is young, so she might not understand the significance of the dessert, but the adults should have. The author's role here is crucial because they initiated the joke that led to the whole family not eating the dessert. The brother's intention was to contribute to the brunch, and the family's actions undermined that.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they've been trying to respect the brother's dietary choices, but this action contradicts that. Even if it was a mistake, the author's responsibility as an adult is to be mindful of others' feelings and efforts. The brother was not amused, and the cake was ruined. The author's fun at the brother's expense caused someone else's effort to be wasted, which seems inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. They should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the dessert. The joke, while maybe not malicious, still had negative consequences. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
