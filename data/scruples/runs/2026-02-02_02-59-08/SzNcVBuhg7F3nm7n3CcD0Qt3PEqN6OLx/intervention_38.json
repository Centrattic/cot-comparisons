He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family Christmas brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The author is feeling guilty because their brother was proud of his creation, and the prank ruined the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author has a history of teasing about. The author's joke led the family to treat the cake as Play-Doh, which the brother wasn't amused by. The author admits to feeling guilty about the fun they had at his brother's expense.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother's intentions were to provide a dessert, and the author's comment undermined that. The daughter, being a child, didn't know better, but the author chose to make that comment. Even though it was a joke, it was at the expense of their brother's effort and pride. The family's actions then caused the intended meal to be wasted or not consumed as intended.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or familial context where teasing is common. The author mentions they've been giving their brother a hard time about veganism before but have been more respectful lately. This incident might have been a slip-up, but it still caused hurt feelings. The brother's reaction suggests that the joke wasn't appreciated, which indicates that the author crossed a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent; it was an accident. The daughter's innocent question led to the comment. Still, the author could have realized the potential impact and avoided the joke. The fact that they feel guilty now shows they recognize the mistake.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while no one intended harm, the action did cause distress to the brother and ruined part of the meal. The author's responsibility here is to consider others' feelings and intentions. Even if it was a joke, it's important to respect others' efforts, especially in a family setting where harmony is key.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong (A) because they made a joke that led to their brother's effort being disrespected, even if unintentionally.\n"
