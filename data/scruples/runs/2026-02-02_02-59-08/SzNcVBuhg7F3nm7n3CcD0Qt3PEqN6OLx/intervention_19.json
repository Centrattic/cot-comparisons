He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a dessert for the family, especially since it's a family event like Christmas brunch. The author admits to making fun of the brother's veganism in the past but says they've been more respectful lately. However, in this case, they made a joke that led to the family not eating the dessert, which ruined the brother's effort.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't mean to be malicious but admitted they found it funny and might have been teasing. However, the result was that the brother's creation was treated as a toy, not food. The brother was not amused, and the author feels guilty for enjoying the situation. \n\nWhile the author might not have intended to be hurtful, the action did disregard the brother's effort and intention. The daughter was just following what she was told, especially since she's four years old. The author could have explained the situation better or at least considered the potential consequences of their words. \n\nSo, even though it was an accident, the author's joke directly led to the family not using the dessert as intended. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the author acknowledges feeling guilty. Therefore, the author is at least partially responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might be expected to present his dessert in a way that's clearly identifiable as food, but the situation might be that the dessert was just too similar to Play-Doh in appearance. However, the author's role in initiating the misunderstanding is significant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, even if the intention wasn't to be mean, the action caused harm to the brother's feelings. The author should have been more considerate, especially knowing the brother's pride in his creation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
