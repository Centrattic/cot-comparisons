He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, in a moment of joking, told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author has a history of teasing about. The author's comment was a joke, but it led to the brother's creation being destroyed. The author is feeling guilty now.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The author's intention was probably just a joke, but the consequence was that the brother's work was wasted. The brother might have felt disrespected or that his effort wasn't appreciated. Even if the author meant no harm, the action caused the brother distress and ruined part of the brunch.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother chose to make a dessert that looked like Play-Doh. Maybe he should have considered that it might be mistaken for something else. But the author's role was in how they reacted. By labeling it as Play-Doh to their daughter, they set off a chain reaction where the family played with it. The author's history of giving the brother a hard time about veganism adds context\u2014maybe they were still teasing, even if they said they were respecting it now.\n\nSo, even if it was a joke, the author's comment directly contributed to the brother's cake being used as a toy. The author had a responsibility to check their comment, especially knowing the brother's pride in the dessert. The guilt they feel suggests they recognize the mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). They should have been more considerate of their brother's feelings and effort.\n"
