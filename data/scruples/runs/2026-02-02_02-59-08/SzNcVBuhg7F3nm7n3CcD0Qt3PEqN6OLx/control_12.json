He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for accidentally making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it. \n\nFirst, the situation: The brother made a vegan cake, which the author compared to Play-Doh. The daughter then played with it, and others joined in, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty because they found it funny but the brother was unhappy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. I need to consider intentions and consequences. The author didn't mean to be malicious; they were making a joke, maybe a playful one. The daughter didn't understand the context, leading to the mix-up. The author's intent was probably light-hearted, not to harm or disrespect the brother's effort. However, the outcome was the brother's cake being ruined and his feelings hurt. \n\nBut since it was an accident, and the author didn't intentionally mock the brother's veganism, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The brother might have overreacted, especially since it was a family event. The author might have learned from the experience and felt guilty, which shows they care. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. However, some might argue that they should have been more careful with their words, especially around a child. But overall, it seems like a mistake without malice, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
