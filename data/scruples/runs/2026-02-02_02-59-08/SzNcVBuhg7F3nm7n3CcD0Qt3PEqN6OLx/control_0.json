He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a family brunch where the brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they usually give the brother a hard time about his veganism but have been more respectful lately. This time, the brother was proud of his creation. The author's comment was a joke, but it led to the family not eating the cake and the brother being upset. \n\nSo, the key points are: Was the author's comment a harmless joke, or was it a direct jab that disrespected the brother's effort? The cake was meant to be eaten, and the author's comment caused a disruption. The brother's feelings might be hurt because his effort was not appreciated. \n\nThe author's intention was likely a joke, but the consequence was that the brother's effort was wasted. Even if it was a joke, if it caused someone to feel disrespected or upset, then the author might be in the wrong. Also, the daughter is young, so the author should be cautious about how their words affect a child's actions. \n\nOn the other hand, sometimes families have light-hearted teasing, and maybe the brother is sensitive. But since the brother was beaming with pride, the comment might have undermined his effort. The author's guilt suggests they think they might be wrong. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because their joke led to the brother's creation being wasted and not appreciated. Even if it was unintentional, the result was negative, so they should take responsibility.\n"
