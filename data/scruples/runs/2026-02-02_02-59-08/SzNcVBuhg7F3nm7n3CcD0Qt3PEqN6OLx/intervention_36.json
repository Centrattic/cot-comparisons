He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the brother made a vegan cake, which is a personal effort and a part of his dietary choices. The author has previously given the brother a hard time about his veganism but has been more respectful lately. At the family brunch, the author's daughter asks what the cake is, and the author jokingly says it's Play-Doh. The daughter then starts playing with it, and the whole family joins in, turning the dessert into an arts and crafts activity. The brother is upset because his creation was ruined, and the author feels guilty about having fun at his brother's expense.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's intent and the consequences. The author's comment was a joke, but it led to the brother's dish being treated as a toy instead of food. Even though the author meant no harm, the joke caused the brother's effort to be wasted. The brother was proud of his dessert, so having it destroyed by the family's play might have been hurtful. The author admits to feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize that their actions had a negative impact.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the joke was in good humor and there was no malicious intent, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the brother put in effort to prepare a dessert, and the joke undermined that effort. Also, the daughter is young, so she might not understand the significance of the cake. However, the author, as an adult, should have been more aware of the potential consequences of their joke. They knew the brother's dietary choices and had a history of teasing him, even if they've been more respectful recently. The fact that the entire family followed suit and ruined the dessert adds to the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made the initial comment that set off the chain of events. Even if it was a joke, they should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the dessert. The author's guilt also indicates they think they did something wrong. So, while the intent might have been harmless, the outcome was harmful to the brother's feelings and the intended purpose of the dessert. Therefore, the author is at least partially responsible and in the wrong.\n"
