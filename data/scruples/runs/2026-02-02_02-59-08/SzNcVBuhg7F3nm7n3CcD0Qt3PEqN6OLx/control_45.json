He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake, and the author joked that it looked like Play-Doh, which led the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a dessert, which is a big deal. The author made a joke that led to the family treating the cake as Play-Doh. The daughter took the comment seriously, and others followed. The brother was upset because his creation wasn't eaten, and the brunch was ruined in that aspect.\n\nNow, the author says they've been cool with the brother's veganism lately but have a history of giving him a hard time. The joke was spontaneous and innocent, especially because the daughter was young. But the result was that the brother's effort was wasted, even if it was a lighthearted moment.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they made a joke that they knew might not be taken the right way. Even if the cake looked like Play-Doh, saying it out loud in front of a child could lead to misunderstandings. The author might have known their daughter would take it literally. So, even if it was a joke, they should have considered the consequences. The brother's feelings were hurt because his effort was undermined, and the family activity overshadowed the meal's purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother should have presented the cake in a way that was less likely to be mistaken for Play-Doh. But the author's comment was the direct cause of the confusion. Also, the author admitted to feeling guilty, which suggests they see some wrongdoing. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the impact on others. The brother was upset, the meal's vegan addition was ruined, and the family's time was spent on arts and crafts instead. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, caused harm. Therefore, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Although it was a joke, they should have been more cautious, especially with a family event and a child involved.\n"
