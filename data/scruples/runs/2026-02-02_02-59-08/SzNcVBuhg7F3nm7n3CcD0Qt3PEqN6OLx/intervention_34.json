He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's look at the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author immediately thought looked like Play-doh. Then, when the daughter asked what it was, the author said it was Play-doh. The whole family ended up playing with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author made a joke that led the family to treat the cake as playdough. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family didn't eat it, which ruined his effort. The author feels guilty about having fun at their brother's expense.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. They meant it as a joke, but the result was the brother's cake being ruined. Even if it was a joke, they should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the cake. The daughter is young, so maybe the author didn't anticipate the whole family joining in. However, as an adult, they should have been more careful with their words, knowing the brother's pride in his dessert. The author's comment was the catalyst for the whole situation. So, even if it was a joke, they were responsible for the outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe the brother could have presented the cake in a way that was clearly food. But the author's comment directly led to the misunderstanding. So, the answer is probably A.\n"
