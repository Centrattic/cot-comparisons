He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother made a vegan dessert, which the author found looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The daughter asked what it was, and the author jokingly said it was Play-Doh. This started a chain reaction where the whole family played with the cake, which upset the brother.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author has a history of teasing about. The author claims they've been respecting their brother's choices lately, but this incident might contradict that. By calling it Play-Doh, the author didn't just joke with adults but influenced a child's perception, leading to others joining in. The brother was not amused, and the dessert wasn't eaten as intended. \n\nThe key points are: intention (was it a harmless joke or a setup for mockery?), impact on the brother's feelings, and the child's innocence. The author enjoyed the joke, which might indicate a lack of consideration for the brother's feelings. Even if the author meant no harm, the outcome was negative for the brother. Family gatherings can be tense if someone's efforts are undermined, especially when a child is involved. The author might be in the wrong for not thinking through the consequences of their actions on both the brother and the family atmosphere. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother's dessert was unconventional, and the author's reaction was a light-hearted way to handle it. But given that it caused the brother distress and the dessert wasn't consumed, it's more about the respect and consideration. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the brother's effort and caused unintended harm, even if it was a joke.\n"
