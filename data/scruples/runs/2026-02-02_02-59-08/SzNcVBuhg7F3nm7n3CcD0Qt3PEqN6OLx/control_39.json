He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author joked that their brother's vegan green cake was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating. The brother was proud of his dessert, and it ended up ruining the brunch's vegan addition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which the author has a history of giving a hard time about. But lately, they've been respecting his choices. The author's daughter asked what the cake was, and the author said Play-doh on a whim. The family then used it as playdough, which the brother didn't find amusing.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author made a joke that led to the brother's effort being wasted, even though they've been respecting his choices. The author feels guilty about having fun at the brother's expense. The brother was proud of his creation, and the family's actions caused him distress.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, intentions matter. The author didn't mean to be malicious, but the joke backfired. However, the brother was the target of the joke. Even if it was a mistake, the author should have considered the brother's feelings. The brother's effort was dismissed, and the author's humor caused disrespect. The fact that they've been respecting the brother's dietary choices before makes it a bit more hypocritical. The author's actions undermined the brother's efforts and caused a situation where the brother's contribution wasn't appreciated. The family's participation might have been innocent, but the author started it. So, there's a responsibility there. The author's guilt suggests they realize the impact. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because they should have thought about how the joke would affect their brother and respected his effort instead of making a joke at his expense.\n"
