He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother made a vegan dessert, which is a mung bean cake, and it's brightly colored and green, looking like Play-Doh. The author has a history of teasing their brother about being vegan, but they say they've been respecting it lately. At the brunch, when the daughter asks what it is, the author says it's Play-Doh, and then the family ends up using it for arts and crafts. The brother was not amused, and the dessert was ruined. The author feels guilty about having fun making fun of the brother's creation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother put effort into making a dessert for the family, the author's comment led to the dessert not being eaten and causing embarrassment or hurt for the brother. The author was teasing before but claims to have been respectful lately. Now, the action was a bit of a joke, but it backfired. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intent was probably to make a joke, considering the brother's past. But the daughter is young and innocent, so when the author said it's Play-Doh, the child believed it and started playing. The family joined in, which made the brother feel disrespected or his effort wasted. \n\nEven if the author had good intentions, the outcome caused the brother's dessert to be treated as a toy. The brother might have felt that his effort was mocked, and the family's behavior during the meal might have been inappropriate. The fact that the author had a history of giving their brother a hard time adds to the possibility that this was another instance of teasing, even if it was accidental. \n\nBut the author says they've been cool with the brother's veganism lately and respected it. So maybe they were trying to be good, but the joke still went too far. The daughter is four, so she can't be blamed for not knowing better. The author, as a parent, might have had a responsibility to correct the misconception once it started, but instead, they encouraged it. \n\nAlso, the entire family participating turned a potentially respectful moment into a mockery. The brother might have felt that his effort was not valued. Even if the cake looked like Play-Doh, the author didn't check with the brother first or clarify that it was a joke. So the family's actions could be seen as disrespecting the brother's creation. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother made a cake that resembled Play-Doh, which might be a bit of an invitation for such a reaction. But that's probably not an excuse. It's still the author's responsibility to not mislead the child and to respect the brother's effort. \n\nThe author's guilt suggests they recognize the mistake. So, even if the intention was humorous, the result was that the brother's dessert was wasted and he felt disrespected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the consequences of their words on the brother's feelings and the family dynamics.\n"
