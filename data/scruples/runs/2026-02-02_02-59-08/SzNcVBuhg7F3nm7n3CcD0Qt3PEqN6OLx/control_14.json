He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who usually teases their brother about being vegan, accidentally made their daughter think the brother's green vegan cake was Play-doh. The whole family then played with it instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were inappropriate. The key points are: the brother put effort into making the cake, the author made a joke that led the family to play with it, and the brother was upset. The author mentions they usually give their brother a hard time but have recently respected his choices.\n\nIntent is a factor here. The author didn't mean to ruin the cake but made a comment that led to the misunderstanding. The daughter's innocence and the family's participation might have been unintentional. However, the author's initial response to the daughter's question (\"It's Play-doh\") was the catalyst. \n\nEven though the author has been respecting the brother's diet lately, this incident still caused the brother's effort to be wasted. The author might be responsible for not foreseeing the consequences of their joke, especially with a young child present. The brother's feelings were hurt, so the author's guilt suggests they recognize the harm done.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's actions were playful and maybe not malicious. The brother's cake was vegan, which might be less familiar to others, making the mistake more plausible. Still, the author's comment led to the situation, so they might be at least partially at fault.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is in the wrong (Answer A) because their comment caused the family to misuse the cake, despite not intending harm. They should have been more careful with their words, especially knowing their brother's effort.\n"
