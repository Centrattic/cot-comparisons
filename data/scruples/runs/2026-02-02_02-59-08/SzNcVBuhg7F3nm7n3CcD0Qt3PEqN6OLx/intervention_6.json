He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author joking that their brother's vegan cake looked like Play-Doh, which led their daughter and the rest of the family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset because it was a special effort for a family brunch.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which is a dietary choice he's proud of. The author has a history of teasing their brother about veganism but says they've been respecting it lately. However, in this case, they made a joke that resulted in the cake being treated like Play-Doh, causing the brother distress and ruining his creation.\n\nNow, considering cultural context and family dynamics. Family gatherings are supposed to be times of togetherness and respect. Joking about someone's dietary choices, especially when they've gone out of their way to accommodate the family (like making a special dessert), can be seen as dismissive or mocking. Even if the author was trying to be funny, the outcome was that the brother's effort was wasted. The daughter's innocent question led to a joke, which then escalated into the entire family playing with the cake. The author acknowledges their guilt, indicating they see the issue.\n\nThe brother's reaction is important here. He was \"not too amused,\" and it ruined the brunch's vegan addition. The author's action led to the brother's emotional distress and the waste of his food. While humor can be subjective, in this context, the joke backfired. The author's responsibility lies in not making light of their brother's efforts, especially when a child is involved. The fact that the author gave their brother a hard time about veganism in the past adds to the problem because it shows a pattern of not respecting his choices, even if they claim to be cool with it now.\n\nAdditionally, the author admits they enjoyed the situation, which is a red flag. It's one thing to make a mistake, but if you enjoyed it, that suggests intent to be dismissive or mocking, even if accidental. The daughter was just following what the parent said, which is part of the issue. Parents are role models, and their words can influence children's behavior, even if unintended.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, did cause harm to their brother's feelings and effort. The responsibility is on the author to be more mindful, especially in a family setting where someone has put effort into a special meal. Therefore, the answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
