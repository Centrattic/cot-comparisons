He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation. The brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author, when asked by their daughter, said it was Play-Doh. Then the whole family ended up using the cake as arts and crafts, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, the brother put in effort to prepare a dessert for family brunch. The author's comment led the daughter to mistake it for Play-Doh, and others followed suit. The brother was not amused, and the food wasn't eaten. The author feels guilty now.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch, but their joke caused a misunderstanding that affected the brother's creation. Even though they were giving brother a hard time before but said they've been respectful lately. However, the comment was a joke that led to unintended consequences. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't mean to be malicious, but their action did disregard the brother's effort. The brother was proud of his dessert, and the family turning it into a toy ruined it. The author did enjoy making fun of the brother's cake, which adds to the guilt.\n\nBut the situation is a bit light-hearted. The family had fun with it, but the brother was upset. So, while the author didn't have malicious intent, their action did cause harm to the brother's feelings. However, since it was an accident and the brother's own choice to make a cake that looked like Play-Doh, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. But the author could have checked, maybe explained it was food before the joke. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because they knew the brother made the cake and chose to make a joke that led others to use it as Play-Doh, despite knowing it was a vegan effort. The impact was negative on the brother. But maybe B if considering it's a minor incident without malice. However, the brother's effort was wasted, and the author enjoyed the joke. Probably A.\n"
