He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter and family think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author, despite giving the brother a hard time about veganism in the past, says they've been respecting his choices. Then the daughter asks what it is, and the author jokingly says \"Play-Doh,\" leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset because his effort was wasted.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's comment led to the cake being used as a toy, which ruined the brunch's vegan dessert. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they directly caused the misunderstanding. Even if it was a joke, the consequences were real. The brother put effort into making the cake, and the author's comment made the family treat it as a toy. The author might have crossed a line by not respecting their brother's effort, even if they were trying to be playful. Also, the daughter is young, so she can't be blamed, but the author's action led to the family's actions. The author's guilt suggests they know it's wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
