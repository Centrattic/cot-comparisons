He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation where they joked that their brother's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert for the family, especially for a holiday brunch. The author, while respecting their brother's dietary choices, made a joke that led the daughter to think it was Play-Doh. The whole family then engaged in playing with the cake, which upset the brother and ruined the dessert part of the meal.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they had fun at their brother's expense. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a respectful perspective, the brother's effort was not respected by the joke. Even if the author has been cool with the brother's veganism, this action undermined that respect. The joke led to a situation where the brother's creation was treated as a toy, which could be seen as dismissive of his effort and intentions. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it was a harmless joke, and the family had fun. But the brother was not amused, and the author's actions directly caused the dessert to be ruined. The daughter was just following the author's comment, so the author's blurted out joke was the catalyst. \n\nConsidering intent: the author didn't mean to ruin the dessert, but the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The author's enjoyment at the brother's expense might be a factor here. The family's actions were a direct result of the author's joke, so they bear responsibility.\n\nIn terms of respect and consideration, even if the joke was meant in a lighthearted way, it's important to respect others' efforts, especially in a family setting. The author should have been more careful with their words, given the brother's pride in his creation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to respect their brother's effort and caused unintended harm, even if it was accidental.\n"
