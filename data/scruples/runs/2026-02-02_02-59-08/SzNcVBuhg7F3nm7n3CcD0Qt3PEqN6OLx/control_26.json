He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author, who usually teases the brother about veganism, jokingly told the kid it was Play-Doh. The kid then started playing with it, and others joined in, which upset the brother. The author feels guilty about it.\n\nNow, considering intent: The author didn't mean to ruin the brunch but made a joke. However, the result was that the brother's effort was wasted, and the family didn't eat the cake. The author was in on the joke and had fun at the brother's expense. The brother was proud of his creation, so the author's action might have been disrespectful, even if it was a joke.\n\nThe daughter is four, so she might not understand the context, but the author knew the brother's feelings and still made the joke. The family's actions led to the cake being used as play-doh, which the brother wasn't amused by. The author's action caused the incident, so there's some responsibility here.\n\nBut the author wasn't malicious; maybe just thought it was a harmless joke. The brother's cake looked like Play-Doh, so maybe the author thought it was a funny reaction. However, the brother's effort and feelings matter. The author might have gone too far by making the joke in front of the kid, leading to others joining in.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. But since the brother was proud of his creation and the author knew the brother's dietary choices, the author's joke was at the brother's expense and caused harm to the brother's feelings. The author's responsibility lies in not respecting the brother's effort and using it as a joke. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
