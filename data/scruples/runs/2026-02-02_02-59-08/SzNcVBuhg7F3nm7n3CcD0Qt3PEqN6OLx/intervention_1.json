He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author joked to their daughter that it was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to use it for arts and crafts instead of eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother put effort into making a dessert, and the author made a joke that led to the family not eating it. The author admits they feel guilty about having fun at their brother's expense. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's intention was probably humorous, but the result was that the brother's effort was wasted. The daughter is young, so maybe the author didn't expect the joke to spread so much. But the author did know the brother's dietary choices and had previously given him a hard time. Even though they say they've been respecting his choices lately, this incident might show a lack of respect.\n\nAlso, the family ended up using the cake as playdough, which the brother wasn't amused by. The author's joke, while maybe not malicious, still caused the brother's dessert to be ruined. The author did enjoy making fun of the brother's creation, which adds to the guilt.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean to be mean, but the impact was negative. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the family didn't eat the food he prepared. The author should have considered that the joke might backfire, especially with a young child involved. So, even if it was a mistake, the author is responsible for not thinking it through and for not respecting the brother's effort, even if indirectly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
