He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author of the story is at fault. The situation involves a brother making a vegan cake that looks like Play-Doh. The author's daughter mistakes it for Play-Doh, and the family ends up playing with it instead of eating it. The author initially says they were giving the brother a hard time about his veganism but have been respectful lately. Then, when the brother presents the cake, the daughter asks what it is, and the author jokingly says it's Play-Doh, leading to everyone playing with it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they made a joke that led to the family not eating the cake, which was the brother's effort. The brother was proud of his creation, so the author's joke might have been inconsiderate. Even if they were trying to be playful, the result was the brother's dish being ruined. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and maybe not made the joke, especially in front of the daughter. Also, they later feel guilty, which suggests they recognize the mistake. So, I think A is the right answer here.\n"
