He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA is in the wrong. The situation is that the author made their daughter think her uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the entire family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his dessert, which was ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's brother put a lot of effort into making a vegan cake for the family brunch. The author, despite giving their brother a hard time about veganism in the past, has been respecting it lately. However, in this instance, the author joked by telling their daughter it was Play-Doh, which caused the family to use it for arts and crafts instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and the author now feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the author's joke was inappropriate or if they're not in the wrong. The brother's effort was wasted, but the author's intent was just a joke. The daughter is four years old, which is a young child who might not understand the context or the uncle's effort. The family joined in the fun, but the uncle's pride was hurt.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the author didn't mean to cause harm, the joke led to the brother's dessert being treated as a toy, which could be seen as disrespectful to his effort, especially since the family was supposed to be eating it. The brother was proud of his creation, so the joke undermined that. The author's past teasing might not be relevant here, but the fact that they \"blurted out\" the joke without considering the consequences is a problem. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that it was a harmless mistake, and the family was just having fun. The daughter was innocent, so maybe the author didn't intend to mock the uncle's veganism. But the outcome was that the uncle's effort was wasted, and the author did enjoy making fun of the situation, which adds guilt.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the joke was a harmless accident or if the author should have foreseen the consequences. Since the brother was present and proud, the author should have been more careful with what they said, especially in front of a child. The uncle might have felt embarrassed or disrespected. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong because they made a comment without considering how it would be received, leading to a situation where the intended food was not used as such. \n\nBut maybe the brother is inconsiderate for bringing a dessert that the rest of the family, including a child, might mistake for Play-Doh. However, the author's responsibility is to not encourage the child to treat it as a toy if they know it's a dessert. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
