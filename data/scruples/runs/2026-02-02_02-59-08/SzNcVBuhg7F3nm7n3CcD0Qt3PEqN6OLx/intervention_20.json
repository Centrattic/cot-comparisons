He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the uncle's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the brother put effort into making a vegan cake, which he was proud of. The author made a joke, calling it Play-Doh, which led the kids and then the whole family to play with it. The brother wasn't amused, and the dessert was ruined. The author feels guilty about the fun they had at their brother's expense.\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequence. The author didn't mean to be malicious, but their comment caused the daughter to play with the dessert. The main issue is whether the joke was appropriate. While the author says they've been respectful of their brother's veganism lately, this incident might have disrespected his effort. The brother's effort was undermined, and the family's reaction could be seen as mocking his creation, even if it was unintentional. The fact that the author enjoyed the situation adds to the wrongdoing. So, even though it was a joke and an accident, the result was that the brother's hard work was wasted, and the family's actions were disrespectful. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong.\n"
