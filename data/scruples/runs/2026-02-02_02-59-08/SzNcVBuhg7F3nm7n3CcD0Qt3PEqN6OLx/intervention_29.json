He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their daughter think the vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The brother made a vegan cake, which looked like Play-Doh. The author told their daughter it was Play-Doh, and then everyone started using it for arts and crafts instead of eating it. The brother was not amused, and it ruined his contribution to the brunch. The author now feels guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made a joke, which led to the brother's effort being wasted. The author admits they had fun making fun of their brother's creation. The brother's cake was a result of his effort and pride, and the author's actions undermined that. Even though the author respects the brother's veganism, they still made a joke that caused unintended consequences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, intent matters. The author didn't intend to ruin the brother's cake, but their joke led to that. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the effort was wasted. Even if it was a playful joke, the outcome was negative. The author should have considered the consequences before making the comment. So yes, the author is in the wrong. They didn't consider their brother's feelings or the effort he put into making the cake, even if it was well-intentioned. The correct answer is A.\n"
