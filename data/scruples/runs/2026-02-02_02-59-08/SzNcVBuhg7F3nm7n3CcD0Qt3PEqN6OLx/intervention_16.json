He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake that looked like Play-Doh. The author's daughter thought it was Play-Doh and the whole family ended up playing with it instead of eating it. The author feels guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. The key point is that the author told their daughter it was Play-Doh. That's what started the whole thing. Even if the cake did look similar, the author made a conscious choice to joke about it, leading the child to play with it. The brother was proud of his creation, and the author's comment led to the family not eating it, which upset the brother.\n\nThe author mentions they've been cool with their brother's veganism lately, so it's not like they were being intentionally mean about his diet. But the comment was a joke that backfired. The daughter is four, so her actions were innocent, but the author is an adult and should have known better. They took a risk by making that joke, knowing that a child might take it literally and then the family would actually play with the cake. \n\nThe brother's feelings were hurt because his effort was wasted. The author enjoyed the situation, which adds to the guilt. Even if it was an accident in a way, the author is responsible for starting the chain of events. There's a difference between a harmless joke and one that disrespects someone's efforts. The brother was proud, so the joke undermined that. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they made a joke that led to the family not enjoying the brother's dessert, despite knowing the brother's pride in it. The key is that the author initiated the mistake and didn't correct it when they realized what was happening. They should have clarified it was a joke once the daughter started playing with it, but instead let it escalate.\n"
