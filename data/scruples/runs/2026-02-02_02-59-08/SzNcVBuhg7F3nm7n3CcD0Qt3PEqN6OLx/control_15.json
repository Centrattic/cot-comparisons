He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother made a vegan cake, which the author mistakenly told their daughter was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was proud of his creation, and the author is now feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a joke that led to a misunderstanding. The brother was being respectful by bringing a vegan dessert, probably to accommodate the family. The author, though, had a history of giving the brother a hard time about his veganism but claims they've been more respectful lately. The main issue is whether it was wrong to make the joke that caused the cake to be treated as Play-Doh.\n\nNow, thinking about the perspective of the brother. He put effort into making a dessert, and the family didn't eat it because they thought it was Play-Doh. That would be frustrating, especially if he wanted to share his creation. The author's joke, even if meant in good humor, might have undermined the brother's efforts. The daughter is four, so she's going to believe her parent. The author didn't check if the cake was actually Play-Doh and just assumed, which could have been a mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought it was a harmless joke, and the family enjoyed the arts and crafts part. But the brother's feelings were hurt, and the author should have been more careful. The brother was proud of his dessert, and the author's comment made it seem like a toy, which could be seen as mocking. Even if the author wasn't intentionally mocking, the joke still led to the brother's effort being wasted. \n\nSo, the author's actions might have been a bit thoughtless. They should have considered the brother's feelings before making such a comment. The daughter is young and innocent, but the parent's responsibility is to be mindful of how their words affect others. The brother's cake was likely meant to be eaten, and the author's joke caused it to be used as a toy instead, which the brother found amusing but ruined the purpose of the dessert. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't think about the consequences of their words on their brother's feelings and the intention behind his dessert. The answer is A.\n"
