He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author joked with their daughter that their brother's vegan cake was Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating. The brother was upset because he put a lot of effort into making the cake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother made a vegan cake, which is a dietary choice. The author has a history of teasing the brother about his veganism but says they've been respecting it lately. The joke led the family to treat the cake as a toy, which the brother didn't appreciate.\n\nIs the author responsible? The key points here are intent and the impact. The author didn't mean to ruin the cake, it was an accident. However, they should have been more careful with their words, especially since the brother was proud of his dessert. The daughter is only four, so she might not understand the difference between food and Play-Doh, especially with the color and texture being similar. The author's joke was playful but might have been taken the wrong way by the brother, even if it was unintentional.\n\nThe family ended up having a different experience than the brother intended. He wanted to share his creation, and the joke undermined that. While the author didn't have malicious intent, their actions still caused the brother's dessert to be treated as a toy, which could be hurtful. The guilt the author feels suggests they recognize the brother's effort being wasted or mocked in a way.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Accidents happen, but the author's reaction might have contributed to the situation. They could have clarified it was food instead of encouraging the daughter's mistake. Even if it was a joke, the outcome affected the brother's feelings. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for not considering the brother's feelings and the effort he put into making the cake, even if it was unintentional.\n"
