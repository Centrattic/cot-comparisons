He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother made a vegan cake, which looked and smelled like Play-Doh. The author was known to give the brother a hard time about his veganism in the past, but had been respecting it lately. Then, when the brother presented the cake at a family brunch, the author's daughter asked what it was, and the author jokingly said it was Play-Doh. The family ended up playing with the cake instead of eating it, which upset the brother and ruined the vegan part of the meal. The author feels guilty for having fun making fun of the brother's cake.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. First, the key points here are the intent behind the comment. The author says they \"couldn\u2019t help it\" and it \"looked like Play-doh to me.\" But they also mention they were giving the brother a hard time before. The daughter is four years old, so she might not understand the difference. However, the author's brother was proud of his creation and the family's actions led to the cake being treated as a toy. \n\nNow, considering the brother's effort to make a vegan dessert, which the author had been respecting. The brother probably put time and effort into it, expecting it to be eaten. The author's comment led the family to use it as Play-Doh, which could be seen as disrespectful, even if it was accidental. The author does admit it was an accident, but the effect was harmful. \n\nChildren often imitate what they see, so when the author called it Play-Doh, the daughter started playing with it. Then the rest of the family joined in. The brother's feelings were hurt, and the meal was spoiled. Even if the author didn't mean to mock the brother, the action was careless. The question is if this is AITA. \n\nIn these situations, the right answer often depends on intent and impact. The author may not have intended to hurt their brother, but the impact was negative. The brother was proud, and the family's behavior was unkind. The author should have considered the brother's feelings and the effort put into the cake. Even if it looked like Play-Doh, they could have explained it was a dessert to be eaten. The author's choice to joke about it, especially given their history of teasing the brother, might be the issue. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong), because despite the accident, their comment led to a situation where the brother's efforts were undermined and mocked, which is hurtful. The author might have known the brother's sensitivity and still made a joke that caused embarrassment. Even if unintended, the responsibility is partially on them for not being careful with their words.\n"
