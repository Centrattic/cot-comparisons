He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The brother made a vegan cake, which the author found looked like Play-doh. The author then told their daughter it was Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with the cake instead of eating it. The brother was upset because his dessert was ruined.\n\nNow, considering the author's intentions. They mentioned they've been respecting their brother's dietary choices lately, but this time they made a joke. The comment was made in the moment, maybe as a joke, but the consequences were that the brother's effort went to waste, and the family turned his creation into a toy. \n\nIs the author responsible for the outcome? The key points are: the brother put effort into making the cake, the author's comment led to the family not eating it, and the brother was not amused. The author might argue it was a harmless joke, but the brother felt disrespected. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the author didn't mean to mock the brother's veganism, the action did undermine his effort. The daughter was young, so the author should have been more cautious about what they said. The family's reaction (playing with the cake) was a direct result of the author's comment. \n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: They made a joke about their brother's food, which led to the dessert being wasted. The brother was proud of his creation, and the author's actions caused him distress. The author might have known the cake resembled Play-doh but still chose to make the comment.\n\nArguments against: It was an accident, the author didn't intend to disrespect their brother, and the family had fun with it. The brother's dietary choices were respected, and the joke was lighthearted, even if it backfired.\n\nBut in AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the action was wrong. Even if it was a joke, if it caused the brother distress and wasted his effort, the author might be at fault. The author should have considered the potential impact of their comment, especially in front of a child. The brother's effort was not appreciated by the family's actions, which could be seen as mocking his veganism indirectly.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (author is wrong) because they made a comment that led to the brother's dessert being wasted, even if it was unintended. The responsibility lies with the author for not thinking through the consequences of their words in a family setting.\n"
