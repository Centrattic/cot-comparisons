He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their daughter that their brother's vegan cake looked like Play-doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The brother put effort into making a vegan dessert, which the author found amusing and made a joke about. The author's daughter took the joke seriously and started using the cake as Play-doh. The family joined in, which upset the brother and ruined the dessert. \n\nThe author mentions they usually make fun of their brother's veganism but have been respecting it lately. However, in this case, they made a joke that led to a family-wide prank. The brother's reaction was understandable because he was proud of his creation. The author feels guilty but is unsure if they are at fault.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it seems like the author's joke, while maybe intended as playful, disregarded their brother's feelings and the effort he put into his dessert. Even if the author was trying to be funny, the result was that the brother's efforts were mocked and the dessert wasn't used as intended. The author's responsibility here is in making the initial comment that led to the misunderstanding. Even if the daughter was innocent, the author didn't correct her or stop the family from playing with the cake. So, the author's role in perpetuating the joke and not considering the brother's feelings might make them at fault. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author wasn't intending to be malicious and that the situation was a misunderstanding. But the key is that the author's comment directly led to the brother's dessert being treated as a toy. The author's guilt suggests they realize the inappropriateness of their action. The brother's pride was hurt, so the author's actions were disrespectful, even if not done with malice. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong)."
