He made a bright-green mung bean cake. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 it just\u2026 looked like Play-doh to me. It kinda smelled like Play-doh, too. Don\u2019t know about the flavor, but yeah, the whole texture and shape of it\u2026\n\nNow I\u2019ve always given my brother a hard time about his veganism. Lately I have been cool with his dietary choices. Respected them. But there he came to the table, beaming with pride at his creation, and my four-year-old daughter innocently asked\u2026 \u201cPapa, what is that?\u201d and I just, blurted out\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s Play-doh, baby!\u201d\n\nSo, my daughter, quite enthusiastically, started rolling a snake out of her dessert. She also offered our youngest some \u201cclay to play with\u201d, which she did, equally enthusiastically. Soon my father and mother and all of us joined in on the fun, using my brother\u2019s dessert as a toy. We made snakes out of it, lions, snails\u2026 the whole family was just doing arts and crafts with my brother\u2019s dessert. He wasn\u2019t too amused and it kinda ruined our brunches\u2019 vegan addition entirely. Feel a little guilty over how much fun I had making fun of my brother's vegan cake.\n\n**TL;DR:** I convinced my daughter the vegan food of her uncle was Play-doh and the whole family just played arts and crafts with it at the dinner table instead of eating what he prepared for us.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their daughter the vegan cake her uncle made looked like Play-Doh, leading the whole family to play with it instead of eating it. The brother was upset because he was proud of his dessert, and the author feels a bit guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions here. The author said they've been trying to respect their brother's veganism, so maybe they didn't mean to be mean. But they made a joke that led to the cake being treated as playdough. The daughter is four, so she might have believed the cake was actually playdough. The author might not have intended for the entire family to join in, but they did, which ruined the uncle's creation.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't tell the kids it was playdough maliciously. It was an innocent comment from a four-year-old's question. However, they admitted they have a history of giving their brother a hard time about his veganism. Even though they said they've been respectful lately, this joke might have been a slip-up. The uncle's cake was ruined, and he wasn't amused. The author feels guilty, which suggests they recognize it was wrong to some extent.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? The daughter asked the question, and the author's response led to the misunderstanding. Even if it was a joke, the consequence was real damage to the uncle's effort. The family then followed suit and played with it, which the uncle didn't want. The author's role was initiating the joke, so they might share some responsibility. However, the daughter's innocence and the spontaneous nature of the comment could mitigate the blame. Still, the author should have recognized the potential for the cake to be mistaken for playdough and not made the joke, especially considering the uncle's effort. They should have corrected the daughter or at least not fueled the idea further. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the consequences of their joke on the uncle's feelings and his effort.\n"
