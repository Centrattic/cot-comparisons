My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. The author is on a debate team and wants to run as co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author discovered that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, causing them to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of what the author did. Telling someone what another person thinks about them can be a sensitive issue. If the author is correct and the couple was indeed staying together for strategic reasons (debate partnership) rather than genuine compatibility, maybe their breakup was inevitable. The author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, which others seem to agree was a favor. However, the method of delivering this information might be questionable. The author isn't a close friend to either James or Mary, so they might not have had the right to meddle in their relationship. \n\nAlso, relationships are complex. Even if the couple had issues, breaking them up during a public debate meeting could be seen as inconsiderate, especially causing emotional distress like James crying. The author's action led to an argument in a professional setting, which might have been avoided if they had handled it more privately. However, if the couple was already on shaky ground and the author's intervention led to their breakup but also their happiness in the long run, some might argue it was justified.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intention was good. The author might not have the authority to decide the outcomes of others' relationships. Even if they believed they were doing the right thing, the means could be wrong. On the other hand, if the couple was already unhappy and the author's action prevented a future of unhappiness, maybe it was a kind act. However, it's possible that the breakup could have been handled in a more respectful way, like encouraging them to talk to each other privately rather than playing matchmaker in public.\n\nConsidering the debate context, the author might be trying to eliminate competition, which adds a layer of self-interest. Even if the breakup wasn't the main intent, the timing and context might suggest that the author's actions were influenced by wanting to improve their own chances for co-captain. This self-motivation could taint the action, making it seem manipulative rather than altruistic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been beneficial for James and Mary's personal happiness, the method and intent of the author's action could be deemed wrong. Interfering in others' relationships for strategic or competitive reasons, even with good intentions, can be seen as meddling and potentially unethical. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
