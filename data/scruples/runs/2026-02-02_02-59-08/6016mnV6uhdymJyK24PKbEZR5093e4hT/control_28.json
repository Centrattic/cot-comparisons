My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is on a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. The main competition is another pair, James and Mary, who are a couple but from different social groups. The author overheard that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship, each having negative opinions about the other. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a debate meeting. James cried and blamed the author, while others thought the author was doing a favor.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to help James and Mary by revealing the true feelings they had but were keeping hidden due to their debate partnership. The outcome was that the couple broke up, which made the author's competition weaker. The problem here is that the author's action might have been motivated by the desire to win the election rather than purely to help the couple. Even if the author believed they were doing the right thing, the method of intervention could be problematic. \n\nTelling someone negative things about their partner without their permission is a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were being honest, but they didn't consider whether the couple wanted that information to be shared. The breakup was immediate and public, which could have been uncomfortable for James and Mary. The author's role as a debate team member should be to support the team, not to interfere in personal relationships for strategic reasons. \n\nHowever, the other team members agreed that the couple was incompatible and their breakup was beneficial. So there's a mix of intentions and consequences. The author might have acted out of a belief that they were helping, but the means used\u2014spreading the couple's private thoughts\u2014could be seen as meddling. Even if the result was positive, the action itself might be ethically questionable. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are important, but the author took it upon themselves to be the messenger without being asked. The couple might have been avoiding the issue because of the debate partnership, but the author's decision to intervene without their consent could be seen as overstepping. The debate team's success as a whole should take precedence over individual political strategies, so the author might be in the wrong by using personal information to gain an advantage, even if it wasn't malicious. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the author's intervention led to a healthier situation, maybe the author's intent was good. But the act of revealing private thoughts without permission is a key issue here. So, the author's action was a breach of privacy and trust, which is generally considered wrong regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
