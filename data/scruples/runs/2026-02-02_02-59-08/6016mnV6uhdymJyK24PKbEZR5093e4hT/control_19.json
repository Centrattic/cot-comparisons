My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other thought. The author is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who belong to different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary aren't really happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author acted out of a desire to help James and Mary realize their incompatibility, but they did so without the couple's consent. Even if the relationship was unhappy, the author didn't have the right to meddle in their personal lives. Relationships are complex, and while the author might have had good intentions, the method was inappropriate. Spreading someone's private thoughts without permission can be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be questioned. They mentioned that Tim is a better debater, and the author is better at politics. The competition for co-captain positions could have influenced their actions. Maybe they wanted to eliminate the competition by breaking up the couple. Even if that's not the case, the line between helping and sabotage is thin here.\n\nThe outcome was that James cried and blamed the author, while others on the team agreed with the author. However, others' opinions don't necessarily make the action right. The author's interference caused direct harm to James and Mary. Even if the relationship was doomed, the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to act as a mediator. It's up to the couple to address their issues themselves.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they invaded the couple's privacy, acted without consent, and caused emotional distress. Even with good intentions, the action was meddling in a personal matter that doesn't concern them. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
