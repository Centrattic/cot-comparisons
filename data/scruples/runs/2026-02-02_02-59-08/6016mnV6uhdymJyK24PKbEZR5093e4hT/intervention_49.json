My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by breaking up a couple to gain an advantage in the debate team co-captain election. The author is part of a debate team and is planning to run with a partner, Tim. They think Tim is better at debating, but they're better at writing and politics. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups.\n\nThe author found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. So the author told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author was doing them a favor.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants to know if I agree. Well, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to undermine their competition by breaking up the couple. That seems manipulative. Even if the couple wasn't happy, the author used their position to interfere in a personal relationship for their own benefit. That's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the couple might have been unhappy and the breakup could be seen as helping them. But the method was to spread what the other thought, which could be considered meddling. \n\nThen there's the impact. James was crying and blamed the author, which shows emotional harm. The author might argue they were doing a favor, but others agreed. But still, was it right to act as a third party interfering in their relationship? Even if the couple wasn't happy, the decision to break up should be theirs to make, not someone else's. The author didn't know the full context, maybe they were still trying to work things out. \n\nAlso, the author's main motivation was to win the election. That's a self-serving reason to interfere. The ethical thing would be to let the couple handle their own issues. The author's actions caused a public breakup and emotional distress, which could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut maybe the other people on the team thought the author was right because the couple was incompatible. However, that doesn't justify the method. The author could have approached it differently, like talking to them about their issues privately but instead chose to reveal the negative thoughts publicly during a meeting. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the outcome might have been beneficial for James and Mary, the way the author did it was manipulative and crossed a boundary. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
