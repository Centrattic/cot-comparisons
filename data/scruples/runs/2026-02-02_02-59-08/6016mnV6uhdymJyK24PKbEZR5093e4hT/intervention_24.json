My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is on the debate team and partners with Tim for co-captain positions. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks negatively about them, leading to a breakup and an argument. James blames the author, but others support the author, saying they did a favor by ending an incompatible relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by ending their unhappy relationship. However, the method involved directly telling them what the other thinks, leading to a public breakup. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a question of privacy and consent. The author didn't have permission to share James and Mary's thoughts. Even if the information is true, sharing it without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships are personal, and while external parties might notice issues, intervening in such a direct and public manner could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action might have been motivated by a desire to help, as the couple was staying together solely for debate, not out of genuine compatibility. The outcome did allow them to break up, which others see as a positive. However, the method involved manipulation by revealing private thoughts, which could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the debate team. The breakup happened publicly during a meeting, causing emotional distress to James. The author might have prioritized their own strategy (weakening the competition) over the well-being of others, even if that's not explicitly stated. There's a potential ulterior motive here related to the co-captain election, which could imply the author acted out of self-interest rather than altruism.\n\nIn terms of morality, even if the action had a good outcome, the means used could be unethical. Telling people what they think of each other without their permission can be seen as violating their autonomy. The author assumed the role of a mediator without being asked and caused direct harm, even if the result was positive.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they overstepped by sharing private information without consent, even if the intention was to help. However, some might argue that the outcome was positive, so the action justified. But generally, respecting others' privacy and autonomy is important, so the answer might lean towards A (wrong).\n"
