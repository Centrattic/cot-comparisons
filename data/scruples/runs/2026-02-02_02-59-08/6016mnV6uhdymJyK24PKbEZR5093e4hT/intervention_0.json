My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person in the story is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. They mention that their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't really happy in their relationship but are staying together because they need to be partners for debate. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to decide between A and B. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to help James and Mary by telling them the truth about each other's opinions. They probably thought that breaking up the relationship would make them happier and also help the author's team win the co-captain election. But did they have the right to interfere like that?\n\nConsent is a big factor here. Did James and Mary give the author permission to share their private thoughts? Probably not. Even if the author knew their thoughts were negative, sharing that information without consent could be a breach of privacy. The author might have thought they were doing a favor, but relationships are complex, and people make their own decisions about staying together or breaking up.\n\nAlso, the immediate effect was a public breakup that hurt James, who was crying. The author caused emotional distress, even if the intention was good. The other people on the team agreed the author was doing a favor, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Just because others support it doesn't make it right.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have had a personal motive. They mentioned that their team's competition is James and Mary, so breaking them up could give their own team an advantage. That introduces a conflict of interest. Even if the author believes they are acting in the best interest of James and Mary, their own motives might be influencing their actions.\n\nHowever, the story says that James and Mary were unhappy and staying together only for debate. The author's action did lead to them breaking up, which others saw as a positive. But the method of doing it was confrontational and public, leading to emotional harm.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't facilitate a conversation between the two, but instead just told each what the other thought, leading to an argument. This approach lacks sensitivity and could be seen as manipulative, even if well-intentioned.\n\nSo, while the outcome might have been beneficial for James and Mary, the means used (without consent, causing public humiliation) could make the author at fault. The ethical consideration here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the result was good, the method was harmful and invasive.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they overstepped their role, caused harm through their actions, and acted without the involved parties' consent. So, the answer would be A.\n"
