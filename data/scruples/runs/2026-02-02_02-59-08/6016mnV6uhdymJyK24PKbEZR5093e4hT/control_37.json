My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is part of a debate team and is running for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, which leads to a breakup during a debate meeting. James is upset and blames the author, but others think the author did them a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to intervene. The key points here are whether the author had the authority or responsibility to meddle in James and Mary's relationship. Relationships are personal, and even if two people are unhappy, it's their decision to end it. The author's motivation was to help them break up because they were incompatible and only staying together for debate. But did they have the right to act as a mediator without being asked?\n\nThe author might argue that their actions helped the couple by ending a harmful relationship. However, breaking up someone else's relationship without their consent is generally seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the intentions were good, the method of intervening by revealing private thoughts could be considered a breach of trust. The author might not have considered the emotional impact their actions could have, like James crying and the public breakup. \n\nAlso, the author's position as part of a debate team might influence their perception. They might see the breakup as beneficial for the team's dynamics, but personal relationships are complex and shouldn't be manipulated for strategic gains. The fact that everyone else agreed the author did a favor suggests some support, but it's possible the others only saw the outcome without understanding the method used.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had enough information. They based their actions on casual conversations, which might not capture the full picture. The author assumed they knew the true feelings of James and Mary, but maybe there were nuances they missed. Acting on incomplete information can lead to unintended consequences, like the public argument and emotional distress.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a difference between giving honest feedback and intentionally causing a breakup. The author's role in the situation is as a third party, so intervening without being part of the relationship could be seen as overstepping. Even if the result seemed positive, the means used were invasive and potentially harmful.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the author's actions were well-intentioned but crossed ethical boundaries by interfering in a personal relationship without consent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
