My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing by breaking up the couple, James and Mary. So the situation is that the author is part of a debate team and is running for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is this couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author heard that James and Mary aren't actually happy with each other but stayed together because of the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethics here. Did the author have a right to interfere? Maybe the author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, but relationships are personal. Even if they were unhappy, was it the author's place to cause a public breakup? The author might have thought that by breaking them up, they'd prevent future issues, but relationships are complex, and people might handle things differently. Also, the author's motives might be partly self-serving to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. Even if the author claims to be doing it for their benefit, the context of competition could influence their actions. The reaction was bad\u2014James was crying, and it happened in front of everyone. So even if the breakup was inevitable, the method of causing it publicly seems harsh. On the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the breakup resolved their unhappiness, maybe the author did a favor. But relationships should be handled privately, and the author's interference might have crossed a boundary. The key points are consent and the method. The author didn't ask if they wanted this information shared; they just did it. So even if the outcome was positive, the action was invasive and public. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for meddling in a private matter without permission, regardless of the outcome.\n"
