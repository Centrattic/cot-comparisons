My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for breaking up a couple by telling each other how the other feels. The situation is about high school debate team co-captain elections. The author, part of a team with Tim, is worried about competing against James and Mary, another couple.\n\nFirst, the author learned that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because they're debate partners. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, intent matters. The author's goal was to help by ending a harmful situation. They might have believed the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons. However, spreading someone else's private thoughts without consent is generally not okay. Even if the intention was good, it's about respecting boundaries. Relationships are personal, and meddling can have emotional consequences. James being upset shows the impact was significant. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the act of revealing private feelings without permission crosses a line. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't have the right to disclose others' private thoughts, even with good intentions.\n"
