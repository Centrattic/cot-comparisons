My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for causing a breakup by revealing their partner's negative thoughts. The situation involves high school debate team members, where the author, part of a debate team, anticipates competition from another couple, James and Mary. The author, knowing that both are unhappy in their relationship but staying together for debate, decides to tell each of them what the other thinks. This leads to a breakup and an emotional scene.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if revealing private thoughts is ethical. The author wasn't a friend of either, just someone who had casual conversations. Even if the author believes they were doing a favor, is it their place to intervene in someone else's relationship? Relationships are private, and sharing personal opinions without consent can be a breach of trust.\n\nThen, there's the impact. The breakup happened mid-meeting, causing emotional distress. James was crying and blamed the author. While others might agree that the couple was incompatible, the method of intervention seems abrupt and public. Could there have been a more discreet way to approach this, like speaking to each individually first? The author's action was direct and led to immediate consequences without giving the couple a chance to address their issues on their own.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation: they wanted to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. There's an underlying self-interest here. Even if the story is presented as helping them, the timing and context suggest that the author might have been more focused on their own goals than the couple's well-being. This could be seen as manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the couple was unhappy and staying together for convenience. The author might think they were freeing them from a bad situation. However, relationships are complex, and even if there's incompatibility, breaking them up without consent can be harmful. The author didn't confirm if the couple was considering breaking up on their own. They just acted on their own assumptions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, invading someone's privacy by sharing personal opinions is generally frowned upon. Relationships require communication, and if the couple wasn't addressing their issues, maybe they needed to have that conversation themselves. The author stepping in as a third party might have overstepped their role.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely acted in the wrong by sharing private information without permission, possibly for self-interest, and causing immediate public fallout. Even if the outcome was seen as beneficial by others, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
