My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple, Tim and Mary, by telling them each other's true thoughts. The situation is in a high school debate team context.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author is on the debate team, and their partner Tim is a better debater, but the author is better at politics. They're competing against James and Mary, another couple. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because they need each other for debate. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a public breakup and James crying, but others think the author did a favor.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions.\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, which might have been causing unhappiness. The breakup happened publicly, and James was upset. But others agreed it was a favor. However, on the other hand, the author meddled in a private relationship without permission, potentially causing emotional distress. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method of intervention might have been intrusive and harsh. \n\nThe author might have crossed a line by acting as a \"friend\" to both parties and revealing private thoughts without consent. Relationships are personal, and while the couple stayed together for external reasons (debate partnership), the author's role in exposing their private issues could be seen as violating their privacy. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the means were questionable. The author's motives might have been self-serving too, to eliminate competition, but the story says they were trying to help. \n\nBut the author's actions led to a public spectacle and emotional harm. Even if the relationship was strained, the way it was ended could be seen as wrong. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on James, who was crying, and instead focused on the perceived benefit for the couple. So, while the outcome might have been positive, the method was problematic. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, sometimes doing the right thing in the wrong way can still make you at fault. The author's action might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was good. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
