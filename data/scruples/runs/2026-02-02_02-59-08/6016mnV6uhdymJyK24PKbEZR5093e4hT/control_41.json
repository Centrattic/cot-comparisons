My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is about someone on a debate team who broke up a couple by telling each of them what the other thought. The author's partner and they are planning to run for co-captains, and their main competition is this couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author's motivation was to help James and Mary by ending their unhappy relationship, which others on the team agreed was a favor. But James blamed the author for breaking them up, and he was upset. The key points here are: Did the author have the right to intervene in their relationship? Was it their place to act as a mediator or even a spoiler of the relationship?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to help the couple by ending an incompatible relationship. If both parties were unhappy and only stayed together for strategic reasons (debate partnership), maybe the author saw an opportunity to do the right thing. The team's reaction supports this view, as others agreed it was a favor.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have permission to share private thoughts. The information that James and Mary had about each other's opinions might be confidential. By revealing these thoughts, the author could have breached trust, even if the outcome was positive. Relationships are personal, and while the couple might have been unhappy, the decision to break up should ideally be mutual. The author's action might have forced the breakup, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, considering the context of competition, the author might have had ulterior motives. If their own partnership was in competition with James and Mary for captain positions, there could be a conflict of interest. The author might have wanted to eliminate a competitor by breaking up the couple, which complicates the moral standpoint. Even if the author's intention was genuinely to help, the underlying competition might have influenced their actions.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on James. He was crying and blamed the author. Even if the breakup was for the best, the method of revealing personal criticisms in public could be very hurtful. The way the information was shared might have been inappropriate, leading to public embarrassment and emotional distress for James.\n\nSo, the question is whether the ends justify the means. If the outcome was a healthier situation for James and Mary, but the method involved breaking trust and causing immediate harm, is the author responsible? The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was good, but the means could be questionable. Alternatively, since they didn't have the right to intervene, they might be in the wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author had the authority or right to meddle in their relationship. Since the author didn't have that right, even with good intentions, they might be in the wrong. However, if the team's consensus is that it was a favor, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by sharing private information without consent.\n"
