My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the right thing by breaking up James and Mary's relationship by telling them what the other thought. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author overheard that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help them break up because they were incompatible and staying together for debate was causing unhappiness. But James blamed the author, while others thought the author was doing a favor. The question is if the author was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider ethics here. Telling someone how another person feels about them can be a sensitive issue. Even if the information is true, sharing it without consent might be crossing a boundary. The author might have thought they were helping by ending a harmful relationship, but relationships are personal, and it's usually up to the people involved to decide their future. The author's action led to a breakup, but was that their place to intervene?\n\nAnother angle: the author might have a conflict of interest. They're competing for co-captains, so breaking up the competition could help their chances. But the author claims the main reason is that they were incompatible. However, even if that's true, is it the author's responsibility to meddle in their relationship? \n\nAlso, the author might not have all the facts. Maybe the issues between James and Mary weren't as clear-cut as they thought. Even if there were problems, the author's role in creating a public argument might have been harsh. Public breakups can be traumatic, and causing that might be a problem regardless of the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship was indeed toxic and the couple was only staying together for competition reasons, the author's action could be seen as ending a harmful situation. But relationships are complex, and the author's judgment might be based on limited information.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of autonomy is important. People have the right to make their own decisions, even if others think it's wrong. By intervening, the author took away James and Mary's agency to decide their relationship. Even if the outcome was a breakup, the method might be ethically questionable.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without consent, potentially for their own competitive advantage, even if the intention was to help. The action disrupted the relationship without allowing the couple to address their issues themselves. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
