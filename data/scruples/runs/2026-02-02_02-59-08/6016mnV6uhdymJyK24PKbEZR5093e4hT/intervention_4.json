My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them their true opinions of each other. The scenario involves a debate team where the author is competing with a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author discovered that the couple isn't happy with each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author had information about the couple's private feelings and shared it, which directly caused their breakup. The key points here are consent and intent. Did the author have the right to share that information? The author's intention was to help them by ending an unhappy relationship, but did they have a right to interfere? \n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. The author was not in a position to act as a mediator or to decide that their intervention was necessary. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role as a peer in a competitive setting doesn't justify interfering in their personal matters. The fact that the breakup happened publicly in a meeting adds another layer of complexity, as it could be seen as a breach of trust and respect for the couple's privacy.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were doing the couple a favor by ending a relationship that was inauthentic. The social dynamics of the team might have influenced the decision, as the couple's partnership was seen as a strategic alliance rather than a genuine relationship. The other team members' agreement that the author was helping could suggest that the intervention was seen as positive, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the author overstepped their bounds. People should be the ones to communicate their own feelings, and the author's actions disrupted the couple's autonomy. The emotional impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, shows the potential harm in such interference. While the outcome might have been beneficial in the long run, the method used was inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because they violated the couple's privacy and autonomy without their consent, even if the intention was to help.\n"
