My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the wrong thing by breaking up Tim's partner with James and Mary. The author is on the debate team and they're planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't really like each other much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which caused a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Telling someone how another person truly feels about them can be a heavy thing to do. Even if the author thought they were doing a good deed, like helping them break up because they weren't compatible, it's still meddling in someone else's personal life. People have the right to their own relationships, even if those relationships aren't perfect. The author might have thought they were being honest, but honesty doesn't justify causing emotional harm without permission.\n\nAlso, the motivation here is important. The author's main goal was probably to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. That's a self-serving motive, which might not be a good reason to interfere. Even if the breakup happened, the author's intent could have been to gain an advantage, which complicates the situation. \n\nThen there's the issue of consent. The author didn't ask if James or Mary wanted to know each other's true opinions. They just decided to share that information, which is a breach of trust. Relationships are supposed to be built on mutual trust, and if both parties were keeping things hidden, the author has no right to expose that unless they were directly asked to mediate the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the outcome. The breakup caused James to cry and blame the author. Even though others thought the author was doing them a favor, the immediate emotional impact is negative. The author might have thought they were helping, but causing public embarrassment and heartache isn't a good result. The fact that it happened in the middle of a debate meeting adds to the public humiliation aspect.\n\nBut on the other hand, some might argue that the couple wasn't happy and the author was helping them realize that. However, that's a bit of a stretch because the couple was already in a situation where their personal issues were affecting their partnership. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by ending a harmful situation, but the method was questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were intrusive and driven by their own strategic goals. They didn't have the right to interfere in another couple's relationship, even if the intention seemed good. The key points are the lack of consent, the self-serving motive, and the negative consequences. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
