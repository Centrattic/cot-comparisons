My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The story is about a high school debater who broke up a couple, James and Mary, by telling each of them what the other thought. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a debate team and is up for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is the couple James and Mary. The author overheard that each of them disliked the other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each one what the other thought, leading to a breakup and an argument during a meeting. James cried and blamed the author, but others thought the author was helping by ending an unhappy relationship that was sustained only for debate.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's motivation was to weaken the competition by breaking up their partnership, which could affect the election. The author acted on information they had about the couple's mutual dislike. They took the risk of revealing this, which caused immediate conflict and ended the relationship. \n\nNow, ethical considerations. Was it right to interfere in their personal relationship for strategic reasons? Even if the relationship was unhealthy, the author's primary motive was to gain an advantage in their own election bid. That could be seen as manipulative or self-serving. However, the author might argue that they were doing a favor by ending a harmful situation that wasn't genuine.\n\nAnother angle: did the author have the right to intervene? They weren't friends with either, just casual acquaintances. Relationships are personal, and unless there's a direct impact on others, it's not their place to interfere. But they justified it by saying it made them unhappy, so they were freeing them from an inauthentic relationship.\n\nThe outcome was that the couple broke up, causing visible emotional distress (James crying), but others agreed the author was right. However, the author's intent was partly strategic, which complicates the moral standing. Even if the result was positive, the means were questionable.\n\nIn ethical terms, intent matters. If the main goal was to undermine the competition, the action was morally wrong, regardless of the outcome. The author should have considered the couple's feelings and privacy. Alternatively, if the author believed they were helping, but the method was inappropriate, they might still be at fault for overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's position as a future leader (co-captain) implies they should model ethical behavior. Interfering in personal relationships for personal gain could set a bad example.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author acted out of self-interest (to beat their competitors) by using information to disrupt a relationship. Even if the relationship was unhappy, the author's role in causing the breakup for their own benefit makes them at fault. They didn't have the right to meddle in the couple's personal life for the sake of their own ambitions. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
