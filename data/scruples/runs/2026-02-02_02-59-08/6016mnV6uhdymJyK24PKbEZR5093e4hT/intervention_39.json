My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who's the person in the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other what they really thought. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is part of a debate team and is trying to get co-captain positions. The main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author overhears that neither is happy in the relationship but they stayed together because of their debate partnership. Then the author decides to tell each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup and a public argument.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's intention was to help them realize they're incompatible, but the method involved spying on the relationship and then intervening directly. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nI should consider the ethics of meddling in someone else's relationship. Even if the author had good intentions, did they have the right to act as a mediator? Relationships are personal, and sharing private thoughts without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the breakup happened publicly during a meeting, which could have been traumatic for both involved. James was crying and blamed the author, indicating emotional distress.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the couple was already unhappy and the author helped them end a harmful situation. But the problem is the method used. Instead of advising them to talk to each other or seek counseling, the author took it upon themselves to reveal the negative thoughts, causing immediate conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. Was it purely to help the couple, or was there an ulterior motive to weaken their competition? The post mentions that the author and their partner are up for co-captain positions against this couple. This could imply that the author's actions were partly self-serving, which might cloud their judgment about being a neutral party. That's a conflict of interest.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but how that honesty is communicated matters. The author's action might have been well-meaning, but without the couple's consent to act as a go-between, it's an overreach. The result was public humiliation and emotional harm, which could be seen as bullying, even if the intention was good.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author likely overstepped their bounds. Even if the outcome was beneficial, the means were inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
