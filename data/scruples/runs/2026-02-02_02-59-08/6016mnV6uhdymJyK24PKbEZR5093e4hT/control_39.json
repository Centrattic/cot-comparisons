My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thinks. The situation involves debate team co-captain elections. So, the author is part of a debate team and their partner Tim is running against another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author did the right thing. Let me think. First, the author's intention was to help them realize they're incompatible. But did they have the right to do that? Relationships are personal, and even if two people are unhappy, it's their choice to end it. The author might have thought they were doing a favor, but inserting themselves into someone else's relationship can be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the couple was staying together for strategic reasons, not because they actually wanted to. The author's action led to their breakup, which might have been beneficial in the long run. But on the other hand, the author didn't have permission to meddle. Relationships are private, and sharing others' opinions without consent can be seen as a betrayal of trust. \n\nJames was upset and cried, blaming the author. The author might have caused emotional harm. Even if others agreed it was a favor, that doesn't necessarily make it right. Intentions matter, but so do actions. The author's action, while well-meaning, crossed a line by disrupting a personal relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be partly strategic for their own team's advantage. If breaking up James and Mary would make their own team look better, there's an element of self-interest. That could affect their judgment of whether their action was purely altruistic. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to privacy in their relationships. The author might have violated that right. Even if the couple was unhappy, it's not the author's place to intervene unless there's explicit consent. The consequences were immediate and public, which adds to the negative impact. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author probably is in the wrong. Even if the outcome seems positive for the couple's long-term happiness, the means used were inappropriate. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
