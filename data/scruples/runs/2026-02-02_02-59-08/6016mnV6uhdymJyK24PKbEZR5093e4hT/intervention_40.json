My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other their negative thoughts. The situation involves high school debate team politics.\n\nFirst, the author, who's on the debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author knows that neither James nor Mary are happy in their relationship but they stay together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had no prior close relationship with either James or Mary, they overheard or found out about their mutual dissatisfaction, and decided to intervene by revealing each other's negative opinions. The result was a public argument and breakup, with James blaming the author, but others thinking it was a favor.\n\nNow, considering ethics and interpersonal relationships. Intervening in someone else's relationship without their consent is generally seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intention was to help, by revealing private thoughts, they violated the trust of both James and Mary. The couple had chosen to stay together despite their issues, possibly for strategic reasons related to their debate partnership. The author's action disrupted their personal lives and caused public embarrassment, leading to emotional distress (James crying).\n\nOn the other hand, the couple might have been unhappy, and the author might have thought ending the relationship would allow them to be happier. However, the author didn't consult them or offer support; instead, they acted impulsively. The line between helping and meddling is thin here. Even if the outcome seems positive (they broke up), the method was intrusive and disrespectful of their privacy.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting autonomy is crucial. The author didn't respect the couple's autonomy to make their own decisions about their relationship. The author's role as a competitor might have influenced their judgment, perhaps wanting to weaken the competition, but the story doesn't explicitly state that. However, the focus is more on their personal belief that the couple was incompatible.\n\nSo, while the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple in the long run, the means used were harmful and invasive. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
