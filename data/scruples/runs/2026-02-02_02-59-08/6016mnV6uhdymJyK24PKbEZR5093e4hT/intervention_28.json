My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. The situation is between James and Mary, who are a couple and debate partners. The author, part of the debate team, found out that both James and Mary weren't happy with each other but stayed together because of their partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author had information about each person's feelings towards the other but wasn't a direct participant in the relationship. By sharing that information, they caused the breakup. The question is whether that's justified or not.\n\nOn one hand, the couple was unhappy but stayed together because of the partnership. The author's action might have prevented a longer-term unhappy relationship. Others on the debate team agreed they were incompatible, so maybe the author was doing them a favor.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't in a position to meddle in their personal relationship. Relationships are private, and even if there were issues, the couple should have addressed it themselves. The author's interference led to public embarrassment (James crying) and disrupted the debate team dynamics. The author might have overstepped by acting as a mediator without being asked.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be self-serving. The competition for co-captains could influence their desire to break up the couple, which introduces a conflict of interest. Even if the outcome was positive, the method was invasive.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, ethics often consider intent and consequences. While the consequence was a breakup that some saw as beneficial, the intent was to undermine competitors, which is manipulative. The method involved spreading information without consent, which breaches trust. Even if the result was good, the action itself was unethical because it violated the couple's privacy and autonomy to handle their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong. They shouldn't have shared others' private thoughts without consent, regardless of the outcome. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
