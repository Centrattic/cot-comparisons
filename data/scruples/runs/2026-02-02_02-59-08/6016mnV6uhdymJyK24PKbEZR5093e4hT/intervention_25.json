My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author knows that James and Mary are unhappy in their relationship but don't want to break up because of their debate partnership. The author tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James blames the author, but others think the author helped them.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author acted as a mediator or truth-teller, revealing each partner's negative perceptions. The result was a breakup, which James was upset about but others saw as beneficial. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships are personal. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author didn't have the right to interfere. They might have thought they were helping, but inserting themselves into someone else's relationship without consent is a breach of privacy. The author assumed they knew what was best for James and Mary, which is a classic case of \"I'm just trying to help\" but without their permission. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. While that's not stated explicitly, it's a possible ulterior motive. Even if not, the act of revealing private thoughts can be seen as a violation of trust. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple was incompatible, the decision to break up should come from them. The author's intervention might have caused unnecessary harm, even if it had a positive outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the couple might have been unhappy and stuck together for the wrong reasons. The author's action could be seen as a kindness. However, the method of intervention is questionable. People have the right to privacy and to make their own decisions, even if those decisions lead to pain. \n\nIn most cases, unless there's immediate harm, it's not one's place to interfere in others' relationships. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, overstepped. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
