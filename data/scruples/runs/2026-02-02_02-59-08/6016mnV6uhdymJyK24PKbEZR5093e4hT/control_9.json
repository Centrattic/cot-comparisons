My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really think of each other. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is on the debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The key point is that the author knew both James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but didn't want to break up because it affects their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nSo, the central issue here is whether the author acted wrongly by revealing private thoughts that caused the breakup. Let's consider the potential arguments for both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were doing James and Mary a favor. The question mentions that others on the team agreed, suggesting that the breakup was seen as beneficial because the couple was incompatible and their unhappiness was being maintained for strategic reasons. The author might feel that they were helping the couple by ending a harmful situation, even if it caused immediate pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the action of revealing private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple wasn't happy, the decision to break up should be theirs to make. The author's intervention could be seen as overstepping, as they took it upon themselves to end the relationship, which might have been better handled if the couple had addressed it themselves. Also, causing a public breakup during a meeting might have been unkind and disruptive.\n\nAnother angle is the motivation. The author's team is competing against James and Mary for co-captain positions. By breaking up the couple, the author might have been trying to eliminate competition, even if indirectly. This could imply ulterior motives, making the action more about self-interest than genuine concern for the couple's well-being.\n\nHowever, the scenario does mention that the author isn't friends with either James or Mary and that the information was gathered through casual conversations. The author might have believed they were acting in the couple's best interest, thinking they were trapped in a bad situation for the sake of debate, not realizing the emotional impact it would have, as James was crying.\n\nBut even with good intentions, revealing someone else's private feelings without their permission can be considered a violation of privacy. The ethical aspect here is whether the end justifies the means. Even if the outcome was a healthier breakup, the method was intrusive and possibly harmful.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the couple's different social groups (popular vs. intellectual) might have created underlying tensions that the author didn't fully understand. The author's role in a debate team might involve strategic thinking, but personal relationships are more complex. The author's action could be seen as meddling in personal matters where they weren't invited.\n\nConsidering all these points, while the outcome might have been beneficial in the long run, the method used by the author was invasive and potentially manipulative. The key question is whether the author had the right to intervene in this way. Since the author didn't have consent to share the couple's private thoughts, it's likely that they were in the wrong, regardless of the positive outcome. People should generally have the autonomy to address their own relationships without third-party interference, even if the third party thinks they're helping.\n"
