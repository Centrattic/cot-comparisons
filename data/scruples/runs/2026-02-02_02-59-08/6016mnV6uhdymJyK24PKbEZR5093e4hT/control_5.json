My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. They mention that their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The key points here are that the author overheard or knew that James and Mary had underlying issues in their relationship but were staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether the author was justified in revealing these thoughts. The author's intention was to do them a favor, thinking that the couple was incompatible and unhappy. However, the action led to a public breakup and emotional distress, with James crying and blaming the author.\n\nI need to consider several angles. First, the intent vs. the consequence. The author's intent was to help, but the method was direct and caused immediate harm. Even if the couple was unhappy, revealing personal perceptions without consent can be seen as a violation of trust. The author didn't ask for permission to meddle in their relationship, which might be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the context of their relationship being tied to their debate partnership complicates things. The author might have thought that breaking them up would weaken their competition, but the story doesn't explicitly state that as a motive. However, the author's focus on winning co-captain positions suggests that there could be an ulterior motive, even if subconscious.\n\nAnother angle is the role of friendship and social responsibility. The author isn't friends with either James or Mary, so they might not have the right to interfere. Even if the group agreed that the author was right, that doesn't necessarily make the action ethical. The immediate emotional impact on James is significant, and causing someone to cry in public is a serious consequence.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was truly unhappy and the breakup was inevitable, maybe the author did them a favor. But the method of revealing the thoughts directly led to the breakup, which could have been handled more sensitively. The author could have advised one or both parties to consider their relationship without explicitly stating the negative opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the outcome was seen as positive by others, the author's action of disclosing personal thoughts without consent likely crosses ethical boundaries. The lack of consent and the resulting emotional harm suggest that the author is in the wrong, regardless of the intention.\n"
