My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a person who told two people in a relationship what each other thought negatively, leading to a breakup. The question is whether the person is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: They wanted to help by revealing the true feelings, thinking that the couple's relationship was affecting their debate partnership and that they were unhappy. The outcome was a breakup, which the author claims others thought was a favor because the couple was incompatible. However, James was upset and blamed the author.\n\nEthically, is it right to meddle in someone else's relationship? Even if the motive is good, inserting oneself into a personal matter without consent can be problematic. The author knew the couple was from different social groups and that their partnership was based on debate, not necessarily personal compatibility. But revealing private thoughts could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if one of them confided in the author.\n\nAlso, the author is part of a debate team, so there's an element of competition here. Could this be a case of using underhanded tactics to gain an advantage? Even if the author's story is true, intentionally causing a breakup might be considered unethical in a competitive setting. It could be seen as sabotage, which is not acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was genuinely unhappy and the author's intervention helped them realize their incompatibility, some might argue it was a kind act. But the key issue is the method: without the couple's consent, the author took a direct approach that led to public humiliation and emotional distress (James crying). That seems harsh, regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the actions, the author's role as a debater might be relevant. Debate teams often have strict codes of conduct, and such behavior could be against team rules. Plus, the author used information they were entrusted with (if they were confided in) to manipulate the situation, which is a breach of confidentiality. Even if others approved, the act itself crosses a line into personal matters without the right to do so.\n\nTherefore, despite the outcome being a breakup that others might agree with, the method and the invasion of privacy make the author at fault. The answer should be A.\n"
