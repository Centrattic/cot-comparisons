My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a debate team member who breaks up a couple by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author is part of a debate team and is running for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author knows that the couple isn't happy but they stay together because of their debate partnership. The author tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting. Some people think this was a favor, others blame the author.\n\nEthically, relationships are private. Even if the author's intention was to help, sharing someone else's feelings without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by ending a harmful relationship, but using their position to spread information that could harm personal relationships is questionable. The fact that the couple is being used for political gain (to get votes) adds another layer. The author's motive could be self-serving, wanting to eliminate competition, which complicates the matter. However, the couple's own unhappiness is a factor. If they were already incompatible and the relationship was a facade, the author might have been doing them a favor. But intentionally causing a public breakup, especially when it's emotionally damaging, is problematic. The line between helping and interfering is thin here. The author's responsibility as a team member to maintain harmony versus their personal gain vs the couple's privacy. The answer might hinge on intent and context. If the author acted with good intentions and the result was positive, maybe not their fault. But the method of revealing private thoughts without consent could still be wrong. So, considering all, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they crossed a privacy line, even if the outcome was beneficial.\n"
