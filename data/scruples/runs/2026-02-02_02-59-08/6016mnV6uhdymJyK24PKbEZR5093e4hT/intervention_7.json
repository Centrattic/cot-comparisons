My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author breaking up a couple by telling each of them what the other thought. \n\nSo, the author is on the debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't really get along but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, causing them to break up during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, while others thought it was a favor.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my input. I need to decide between A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nFirst, consider intentions. The author's motive was to help the couple by ending a harmful relationship. But relationships are private, and the author didn't have the right to intervene. Even if the couple was unhappy, it's not the author's place to meddle. The author might have acted out of self-interest to eliminate competition, which complicates things. However, the outcome was positive for the couple in terms of ending an unhappy relationship. Others supported the author's action, but that doesn't justify the action.\n\nEthically, people have the right to privacy and autonomy. The author invaded their privacy and caused emotional harm. Even if the result was good, the means were unethical. The author's action led to public embarrassment and distress, which is a problem. The debate team environment might be competitive, but that doesn't justify personal interference. The author's actions were a breach of trust and respect for the couple's relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
