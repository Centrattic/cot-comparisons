My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other person thought. The scenario is from a debate team where the author (AITA) is part of a partnership and their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both are unhappy in the relationship but staying together for debate, so they told each side what the other thought. This led to a breakup and an argument during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Was it right for the author to intervene in their personal relationship? Telling someone what another person thinks about them can be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the author's intention was to help, they didn't have permission to share that information. Relationships are private, and inserting oneself into that dynamic without consent can be problematic.\n\nJames was upset and blamed the author, which suggests that the author's action hurt him. While others on the team might agree that the couple was incompatible, that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. Everyone else's opinion isn't the standard here; the author's actions directly caused the breakup. The author had no right to act as a mediator without being asked. Even if the result was a breakup, the method used was invasive and could be considered disrespectful to the couple's privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple wasn't happy and might have ended the relationship eventually. But the author accelerated the breakup in a public and dramatic way, which could have been done more sensitively if they had approached it differently. However, the act of revealing private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nIn terms of ethics, most people would say that it's not their place to interfere in someone else's personal life unless they were asked for help. The author might have good intentions, but the means were inappropriate. So, yes, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
