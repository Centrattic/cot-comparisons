My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple to help their debate team. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset, blaming the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple, right? Because James and Mary's partnership could get more votes due to their different social groups. But the author's action was to tell each of them the negative things the other thought about them. \n\nIs it ethical to meddle in someone else's relationship, even if you think it's for their own good? The author might have thought they were doing a favor, but relationships are personal. Even if the couple wasn't happy, the author's role in causing the breakup is questionable. They might have crossed a line by acting as a go-between and revealing private thoughts, which could be seen as betrayal of trust. \n\nAlso, the motivation here is important. The author's main concern is winning the election. So if the breakup helps their chances, does that justify the action? Manipulating a situation to their advantage might be unethical. Even if others agree it was a favor, the method used could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the couple was unhappy and the breakup was inevitable. But the author's intervention caused an immediate and public breakup, which might have been traumatic for James, as he was crying. The author's actions led to emotional distress, which is a negative outcome regardless of the intention. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably acted wrong by interfering in the couple's personal matters, even if the outcome aligned with their goals. The right approach would have been to focus on their own campaign rather than meddling in others' relationships. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
