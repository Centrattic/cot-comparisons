My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who started this situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up a couple by telling them each other's true thoughts, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. The person involved is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains, anticipating competition from another couple, James and Mary. \n\nSo, the author here decided to tell each of them what the other thought. The result was a breakup. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to intervene. The key points here are the intentions and the consequences. The author's motivation was to help prevent a bad relationship that was only maintained for debate reasons. They observed that the couple was unhappy but stayed together because of their partnership in debate. \n\nBut did the author have the authority or the right to step in? Relationships are personal, and even if two people are in a bad relationship, it's their decision to end it. The author assumed the role of mediator without being asked. Even if they had good intentions, interfering in someone else's relationship without their consent can be problematic. \n\nThen there's the method. Telling each person what the other thinks could be seen as spreading rumors or gossip, even if true. It's possible that the author's information wasn't entirely accurate, and there's a risk of miscommunication. Also, causing a public argument during a meeting might have been disrespectful to James and Mary, especially if they didn't want their private relationship issues exposed. \n\nOn the other hand, the outcome was that the couple broke up, which might have been better for both in the long run. Others support the action because they saw the incompatibility. But breaking up a relationship, even for good reasons, is a significant action that should be left to the individuals involved. \n\nThe ethical aspect here is about respecting others' autonomy. The author might have thought they were helping, but they undermined the couple's right to make their own decisions. Even if the relationship was unhealthy, the author's intervention was direct and possibly unnecessary. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a debate team, where teamwork and respect are important, causing a public breakup could have created a hostile environment. The author might have prioritized their own goals (winning the captain election) over maintaining team harmony. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might have been to help, the action itself was an overreach into the couple's personal matters. The right to end a relationship lies with the individuals involved, not a third party, even if that third party believes they're acting in the couple's best interest. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
