My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each of them what the other really thought. So, the scenario is that the author is part of a debate team and their partner is planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stayed together for the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James cried and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: Did the author have the right to intervene? Was it their place to tell each person what the other thought? Even if they meant well, is it ethical to meddle in someone else's relationship, especially if it leads to public embarrassment or emotional distress?\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by ending a toxic or unhappy relationship. The couple was staying together for strategic reasons (the debate partnership), but their incompatibility was affecting them negatively. Others on the team agreed it was a favor, so maybe the author was right in the sense that the relationship was harmful and needed to end.\n\nBut on the other hand, relationships are personal. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author isn't in a position to decide for them. Telling each of them what the other thought without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the information was true, the author's actions led to a public breakup and emotional harm. James was crying, which indicates significant distress. The author might have overstepped by not letting the couple resolve their issues themselves or by not considering the consequences of their actions.\n\nAlso, the motivation here is important. The author is competing for a position, so maybe there's an ulterior motive. If breaking up the couple gives the author a better chance at winning the co-captain position, then the action could be self-serving. But the author claims it was to do them a favor. However, the outcome was disruptive and caused emotional harm regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky situation. If the intent was good but the method was harmful, does that matter? In ethical terms, intentions vs. consequences. If the consequence was significant emotional harm, even with good intent, the action might still be considered wrong. Also, the author didn't get permission to act as a mediator. They assumed they knew what was best for the couple without involving them in the decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they intervened without the couple's consent, caused public embarrassment, and their motives might be mixed. Even though the relationship was unhappy, it's not the author's place to decide that for the couple. The right approach would have been to let the couple handle their issues themselves or to advise them to consider their partnership's impact on their well-being without revealing personal criticisms.\n"
