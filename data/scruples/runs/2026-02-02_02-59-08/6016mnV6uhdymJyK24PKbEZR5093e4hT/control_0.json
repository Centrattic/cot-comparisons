My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the person is on a debate team and their partner is planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to help by revealing the true feelings. But did they overstep? Relationships are private, and even if they were staying together for debate, it's still their personal choice. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by ending an unhappy relationship, but did they have the right to intervene like that?\n\nOn one hand, the breakup might be better for both parties in the long run, as they were incompatible. On the other hand, the author acted as a mediator without being asked, which could be seen as meddling. Also, the fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests that the action had a negative impact on him. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the method might still be questionable. Trust and privacy are important, and the author's action could be seen as a breach of that trust. \n\nSo, while the outcome might have been positive (ending an unhappy relationship), the means of achieving it could be considered wrong. The author didn't ask for consent to share such personal information. It's possible that the author crossed a line by revealing what each thought of the other, regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
