My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did the right thing by telling James and Mary what they each thought of the other, leading to their breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a debate team and partnered with Tim for co-captain positions. Their main competition is James and Mary, who are a couple from different social groups. The author noticed that both James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, causing an argument and breakup during a meeting. James cried and blamed the author, but others thought the author was doing them a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted as a mediator by revealing each person's true feelings. The question is whether that's wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be seen as helping them break up for the better, as they were unhappy. The story mentions that others agreed they were incompatible and the breakup was for their own good. But on the other hand, the author might have overstepped by revealing private thoughts without permission. Even if the intent was good, did they have the right to interfere in their relationship?\n\nConfidentiality is a big part of this. If the author overheard or was told something in confidence, sharing that could be a breach of trust. Also, relationships are complex. Even if the couple wasn't happy, breaking them up could have unintended consequences. The author might not fully understand the dynamics, maybe there were other factors or reasons they were staying together, like family pressure or fear of social repercussions. \n\nJames was upset and blamed the author, which suggests that the action was hurtful. Even if others thought it was a favor, the author's role as a friend or peer might not justify acting as a matchmaker or breakup agent. The author's motivation was probably to eliminate competition for the co-captain position, but that could be a conflict of interest. Even if the author didn't act with malice, the action might have been driven by self-interest, which complicates the morality of the situation.\n\nAnother angle: relationships where people stay together for external reasons (like team partnerships) can be fragile. The author's intervention might have exposed the underlying issues, but was it their place to do so? Maybe they should have encouraged the couple to communicate themselves instead of stepping in. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important, but so is respect for others' privacy and autonomy. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by being honest, but honesty doesn't always mean disclosure. Sometimes, people need to confront their own issues without external interference. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without being asked, potentially violating trust and causing public humiliation. Even if the outcome was positive (breaking up an unhappy relationship), the method was intrusive and could have been handled differently. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author shows the emotional impact, which might not have been necessary. Therefore, the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, was inappropriate.\n"
