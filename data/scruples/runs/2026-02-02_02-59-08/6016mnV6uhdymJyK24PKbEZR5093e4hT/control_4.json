My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thought. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is on the debate team and is running for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competitors are James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor since they were incompatible.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. The author acted as a mediator, so to speak, bringing to light each partner's true feelings. On one hand, they might have helped the couple realize they're not compatible and end an unhappy relationship. On the other, they intentionally caused a breakup by revealing private thoughts, which might have been a breach of trust with both James and Mary.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't directly ask for those thoughts. They probably inferred them from casual conversations. Also, by acting as a go-between, the author might have disrupted the couple's dynamic without their consent. Relationships are supposed to be between the two people involved; third parties inserting themselves can be problematic unless there's a valid reason.\n\nHowever, the context is that the couple stayed together solely for the debate partnership, which suggests their relationship's foundation wasn't strong. The author's action led to an immediate breakup during a meeting, which could have been disruptive, but others on the team agreed it was a favor. The key here is intent: the author wanted to help by ending a fake relationship for the sake of debate politics rather than their actual happiness.\n\nBut is it the author's place to do that? Even if the relationship was unhappy, revealing private thoughts without permission is a breach of confidentiality. The author might have overstepped, even if their intention was good. The consequences were significant\u2014James was crying, and the breakup happened publicly. The author's actions might be seen as meddling for personal gain (to beat the competition), which adds a self-serving motive.\n\nSo, balancing the intent and the consequences. The author might be in the wrong because they acted as a third party in a relationship, used information they weren't supposed to, and caused emotional harm. Even if the outcome was positive in the eyes of others, the means were questionable. The author's self-interest in wanting to defeat James and Mary as competitors could also be a factor. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
