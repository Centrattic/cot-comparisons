My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is part of the debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. They mention that Tim is a better debater, but the author is better at writing and politics. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship but stayed together for the sake of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author did them a favor.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down. The author's intention was to help by revealing the true feelings, which they overheard. But the consequence was a public breakup that caused James to cry. The author's action might have been well-intentioned, but did they overstep? \n\nOn one hand, if the author didn't have the permission to share those thoughts and the couple was keeping their issues private, the author might have violated their trust. Even if the couple was unhappy, it's their relationship, and others shouldn't meddle unless there's a valid reason. The fact that the breakup happened in a public setting (a debate meeting) could be seen as causing embarrassment or unnecessary drama.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was using the partnership as a crutch to stay together, which the author might have thought was harmful in the long run. If the author believed that they were both unhappy and the breakup would be beneficial, maybe they thought they were doing the right thing. However, the method of revealing the truth abruptly and in a public setting might have been too harsh.\n\nBut is it the author's place to interfere in their relationship? Even if the couple was unhappy, it's their choice to stay together for the partnership. The author could have approached it differently, like talking to each of them privately, not revealing the information in a way that caused a public scene. By doing so, the author took responsibility for the outcome, and that's where the issue lies.\n\nAlso, considering the competition angle, there might be an element of wanting to undermine James and Mary's partnership to have a better chance at co-captaincy. The author might have had ulterior motives, which could make their actions more questionable. Even if they didn't, the timing and method of revealing the information could be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but it's also about how and when the truth is revealed. The author's role here is to be a competitor, not a relationship counselor. Meddling in a personal relationship for strategic reasons might be crossing a line. Even if the outcome was a breakup, the method was intrusive and possibly damaging in a different way.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by revealing private thoughts without consent, especially in a public and dramatic manner. While the intention might have been to help, the execution was problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, which would be answer A.\n"
