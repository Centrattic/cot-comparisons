My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author did the right thing by breaking up the couple, James and Mary, by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is part of the debate team and is running for co-captain with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because they need each other for debate. The author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. The author acted based on the belief that their continued relationship was causing unhappiness. By revealing each other's true opinions, the author thought they were helping them realize the incompatibility. But is it ethical to act as a mediator in someone else's relationship, especially by sharing private thoughts?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If both parties were already aware of some issues but didn't address them, maybe the author intervened out of good intentions. However, intentionally disclosing others' private thoughts without their consent can be seen as a violation of trust. Even if the intention was to help, the method might be questionable. People might argue that it's none of the author's business to interfere, even if they think they're helping. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's actions led to a breakup that both parties were already considering (since they were unhappy), then it could be seen as a positive outcome. The fact that others on the team agreed suggests that the author's action was perceived as a positive intervention. But James was upset and cried, which might indicate that the situation was more sensitive than the author anticipated.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation might not be purely altruistic. Since James and Mary are a potential threat to the author and Tim's co-captain bid, breaking them up could be strategic. This complicates the matter. If the author's primary motive was to eliminate competition rather than genuine concern for the couple's well-being, that's a different ethical consideration. The scenario doesn't clearly state the author's true motive, but the fact that they mention anticipating competition suggests that there's a strategic element involved. However, the author claims the intention was to help them be happy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the intervention was done with good intentions and the outcome was positive (they were unhappy and broke up), maybe not. But if the author meddled in a way that breached trust or crossed a line into someone else's personal affairs without their consent, then maybe yes. The line between helping and meddling can be thin. The fact that the author isn't friends with either couple adds another layer; they might not have the right to act as a mediator. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have been for the better, the method involved sharing private thoughts without consent, which is ethically questionable. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they intervened without permission, even if their intentions were good.\n"
