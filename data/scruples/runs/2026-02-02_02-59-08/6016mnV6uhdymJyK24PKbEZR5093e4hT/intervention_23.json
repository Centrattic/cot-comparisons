My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author overheard that James and Mary aren't really happy in their relationship but stay together because they're debate partners. The author then told each of them what the other thought about them, which caused an argument and a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author was doing them a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to intervene in James and Mary's relationship? Was it their place to disclose private thoughts between the couple? Even if the couple was unhappy, does the author have a responsibility to not interfere?\n\nI think the author's intention was to help by exposing the incompatibility. However, relationships are personal, and revealing someone else's private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the outcome was a breakup, the method was unethical. The author used their position in the debate team to meddle in a personal matter, which could be seen as overstepping. Also, causing a public argument during a meeting might have been unnecessary and harsh. So, while the outcome might have been beneficial to James and Mary, the means justify the ends here. The author should have encouraged the couple to talk to each other rather than act as a third-party mediator. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
