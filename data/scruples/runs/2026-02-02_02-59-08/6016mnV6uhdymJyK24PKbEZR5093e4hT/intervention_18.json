My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author says that James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship but are staying together because they need each other for debate. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought the author did the right thing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author knew that James and Mary's relationship was strained and that they were staying together for debate. The author then intervened by revealing each other's negative thoughts. This caused a breakup, which might have been beneficial for both individuals if they were unhappy, but it's done without their consent.\n\nNow, the main ethical issue here is about privacy and consent. Relationships, even if they are in the context of a team, are personal. By sharing what each thought of the other, the author is essentially breaking confidentiality. Even if the author's intention was to help them realize they're incompatible, they didn't ask for permission to share these thoughts. The couple had the right to keep their personal feelings private.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. The breakup happened in a public setting during a debate meeting, which could have been embarrassing for both parties. James was crying, indicating emotional distress. While others might agree it was a favor, the method used was confrontational and public, which is harsh.\n\nHowever, one could argue that the author was trying to do the right thing by freeing the couple from an unhappy situation. But the line between helping and interfering is crossed when it's done without consent. The author's role as a debate teammate doesn't necessarily give them the right to meddle in personal relationships, especially when it's to benefit their own political goals (running for co-captains). There's a potential conflict of interest here; the author might have wanted to eliminate the competition by breaking up the team.\n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as manipulative. By revealing what each thought of the other, they might have influenced the situation to create a breakup that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Even if the couple was unhappy, the timing and manner of the intervention could have been handled more sensitively, perhaps by advising them to talk to each other instead of revealing the thoughts publicly.\n\nIn summary, the author crossed a boundary by sharing private thoughts without consent, which led to a public breakup and emotional harm. Even if the outcome was positive in some ways, the method was unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
