  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the debate team and the author, let's call them Alex, who is on a co-captain campaign with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups and are in a relationship. Alex found out that James and Mary don't really like each other and are unhappy but staying together because of their debate partnership. Then Alex told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup in front of everyone, with James crying and blaming Alex. Others thought Alex was doing a favor.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and the right to meddle in others' relationships. On one hand, Alex might have been trying to help James and Mary by ending an unhappy relationship. But on the other hand, breaking up a couple is a big deal, and doing so by revealing private thoughts without consent could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, the question is whether Alex overstepped. Relationships are personal, and even if they were unhappy, the decision to break up should be made by the couple themselves. By spreading what each thought of the other, Alex might have caused harm, especially since James was upset and felt directly blamed. Even if others saw it as a favor, it's not up to Alex to decide that the relationship was unfixable. There's also the motive\u2014maybe Alex wanted to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. That could be a conflict of interest.\n\nBut then, the story says that the couple was staying together for the sake of debate, not their relationship, which might have been a factor. However, the right to decide their future was theirs, not Alex's. So even if the outcome was a breakup, the method of achieving it was interfering in their personal matters without their consent. That's probably where the fault lies. So the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
