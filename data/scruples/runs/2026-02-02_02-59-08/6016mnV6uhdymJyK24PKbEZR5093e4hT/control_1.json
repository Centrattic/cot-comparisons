My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their mutual negative opinions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is on a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is James and Mary, a couple from different social groups. The author, knowing that James and Mary don't actually get along well (they think each other's traits are negative), decides to tell them what the other thinks. This leads to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention was to prevent the couple from keeping up a fake relationship for debate reasons, which they believed was making them unhappy. The result was a breakup, with James blaming the author, but others on the team agreeing it was a favor.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors to consider are consent and the right to meddle in others' relationships. The author didn't ask James or Mary directly if they wanted to know what the other thought. They assumed that revealing these opinions would help them, but relationships are complex. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role in breaking them up without their consent could be problematic. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to help them by ending an incompatibility they were maintaining for strategic reasons. The team's support suggests that the outcome was seen as positive. But the method of intervention\u2014telling each of them the negative opinions\u2014might have been harsh. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like advising them to communicate, could have been better. \n\nEthically, people have a right to control their personal information and relationships. The author shared private perceptions without permission, which can be seen as a violation of trust. Even if the result was a breakup that others deemed beneficial, the means might still be wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were promoting honesty in the relationship, which is generally positive. But relationships are personal, and the author's involvement could be seen as overstepping. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome had positive aspects, the author's actions involved meddling without consent. So, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
