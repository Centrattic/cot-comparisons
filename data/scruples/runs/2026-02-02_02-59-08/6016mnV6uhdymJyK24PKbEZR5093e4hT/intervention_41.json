My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person in the story, the author, is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary aren't actually happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to decide based on the situation. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to expose the incompatibility between James and Mary so that their relationship wouldn't be an obstacle in the debate competition. The author believed that by breaking them up, it would make things fairer for their own team, which might have a better chance against a broken-up couple. But is that a valid reason to interfere in someone else's relationship?\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author overheard or found out that James and Mary had mutual negative opinions but weren't addressing them. By revealing these thoughts, the author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator or someone who decides the relationship's fate. Even if the couple was unhappy, the author didn't ask for permission to intervene. Relationships are personal, and even if there are issues, it's up to the people involved to decide how to handle them. \n\nMoreover, the author's action caused an argument in public, leading to an immediate breakup. James was crying and blamed the author. While others might think the author did a favor, it's still a violation of trust. The author didn't consider the emotional impact on James and Mary. Even if the couple was unhappy, the way the author handled it\u2014suddenly revealing these thoughts in a public setting\u2014was harsh and potentially hurtful. \n\nAnother angle is the motivation. The author's main concern was their own competition in the debate co-captain election. This introduces a conflict of interest. Their decision to break up James and Mary wasn't purely about helping the couple but also about their own gain. That makes the action more self-serving and less about the couple's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was doing the right thing by helping the couple realize their incompatibility and end a harmful relationship. However, the method and the lack of consent are problematic. It's one thing to offer advice if asked, but entirely another to act as a third party and force a decision on them without their input.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author crossed those boundaries by not respecting the couple's privacy and autonomy. Even if the outcome seemed positive (the breakup), the means were ethically questionable. So, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned from a third-party perspective, were not their place to mediate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
