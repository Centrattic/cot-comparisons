My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other what they really thought. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is on the debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author knows that James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author overheard or knew that James and Mary had negative thoughts about each other, decided to meddle, and that caused the breakup. The author's intention was possibly to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple, thinking that their partnership was holding them back. However, the author claims that others agreed it was a favor because the couple was incompatible but stayed together for debate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nEthically, interfering in someone else's relationship without their consent is generally considered wrong. Even if the intention was to help them, the method involved deception or betrayal of trust. The author didn't consult with James or Mary; they just acted on their own, which can be seen as invasive and harmful. \n\nAlso, the author might have had ulterior motives related to their own competition for co-captains. Even if they didn't explicitly state that, the action could be seen as underhanded to gain an advantage. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was doing a favor by revealing the truth, allowing the couple to part ways and be happier. The story mentions that others agreed with the author, suggesting that the relationship wasn't healthy. But even if the outcome was positive (the breakup), the means were questionable. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the action of intentionally causing a breakup without consent is typically considered morally wrong. People have the right to privacy, and relationships are personal. The author overstepped by sharing private thoughts that could harm someone else's relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they meddled in a private matter without permission, potentially out of self-interest, and caused emotional harm. Even if others agreed, the method was inappropriate.\n"
