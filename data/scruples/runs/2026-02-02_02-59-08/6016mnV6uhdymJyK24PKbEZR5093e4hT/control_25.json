My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a debate team where the author, part of a team running for co-captains, is concerned about another couple, James and Mary, who might be their competition. The author discovered that the couple isn't happy in their relationship but are staying together for their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James blames the author, but others think the author helped them.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethics here. Was it right to intervene in their relationship? Relationships are personal, and even if they were only staying together for a shared goal, revealing private thoughts could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might have thought they were doing a favor by ending a harmful situation, but relationships are complex. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method of disclosure without consent is questionable. People have the right to privacy and to make their own decisions about their relationships.\n\nHowever, the couple's dynamic was affecting their debate partnership and possibly their performance. The author's team might have a strategic interest in them breaking up, which complicates matters. There's a conflict of interest here\u2014personal ethics vs. strategic gain. The author might have acted out of self-interest, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple's unhappiness and the author's belief that they're incompatible might have been valid. If the author truly believed they were unhappy, perhaps the breakup was for their own good. But the author didn't approach them to mediate or suggest separation; instead, they directly revealed each other's negative thoughts. That's a direct intervention without consent.\n\nThe key factors are consent and the right to privacy. Even if the outcome was positive (the couple breaking up to be happier), the means by which the author achieved it could be unethical. It's possible the author's actions were harmful, even if well-intentioned. People should be allowed to address their own relationship issues without third-party interference, especially when motives might be mixed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a privacy boundary and manipulated the situation for their own benefit, even if it led to a breakup that others saw as positive. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
