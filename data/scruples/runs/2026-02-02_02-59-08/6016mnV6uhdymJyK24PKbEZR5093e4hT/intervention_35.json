My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them each other's negative opinions. The scenario is in a high school debate team context.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary don't really get along but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to their breakup. James is upset and blames the author, while others think the author did a favor.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author acted out of strategic reasons for their own campaign, had knowledge of the couple's incompatibility, and intervened to break them up. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships are personal, and even if the couple isn't happy, it's generally not up to others to interfere. The author's motivation was self-serving\u2014helping their own chances for co-captain by disrupting the competition. Even if the couple was unhappy, causing them to break up could be seen as manipulative.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the couple was already on bad terms and their breakup might have happened eventually. But intentionally revealing private thoughts and causing a confrontation in a public setting seems harmful. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests emotional harm caused by the action.\n\nOthers on the team agreed the author was doing a favor, but that's more about the outcome rather than the ethics of the action. People might support the idea that the couple was incompatible, but that doesn't necessarily justify the means used.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' autonomy and privacy is important. The author didn't have the right to meddle in their relationship, even with good intentions. The action was a violation of trust and privacy, and it was done to benefit the author's own goals. That seems like a breach of trust and a form of manipulation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
