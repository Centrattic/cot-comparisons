My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thinks. The situation involves a debate team where the author is trying to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is the couple James and Mary. The author found out through casual conversations that the couple isn't happy with each other and decided to tell each one what the other thinks. This led to a breakup and a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by breaking up their toxic relationship. They believed that the couple was staying together just because of their debate partnership and not because of genuine compatibility. The author might think that by ending the relationship, they're doing a favor, as others on the team agreed with this view.\n\nHowever, the action involved revealing private thoughts that James and Mary had about each other. Even if those thoughts were negative, the author didn't have the right to disclose them. Relationships are personal, and sharing such information without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that James was crying and blamed the author indicates that the method was hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the outcome was positive in that the couple broke up and might be happier now. The team's support suggests that the author's action had a good effect, but intent isn't the only factor here. The means used to achieve the outcome were questionable. The author might have crossed a boundary by mediating in someone else's relationship without being directly involved. It's not their place to act as a matchmaker or breaker, even with good intentions.\n\nAlso, the author's motives could be questioned. While they claim it was to help the couple, there's a potential ulterior motive to weaken the competition for the co-captain position. However, the story doesn't explicitly state that. The key issue is the act of revealing private information without consent, which is ethically problematic regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the action was unethical because it involved sharing private thoughts without permission, even if the result was positive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
