My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author revealing to each member of a debate couple what the other thinks of them, leading to a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of the debate team and is competing for co-captain positions. The main competitors are a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author knows that their relationship is strained because of their differing personalities and debate partnership. The author decides to tell each person what the other thinks, leading to a breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the key points. The author's intention was to help them realize their incompatibility, which others agreed was a favor. However, the method used was directly revealing negative perceptions, which caused emotional distress. \n\nEthically, manipulating or interfering in someone else's relationship can be problematic. Even if the intentions were good, the act of spreading or revealing personal criticisms without consent can be seen as violating trust. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by preventing a forced relationship, but the approach could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nAnother angle is the context of debate and competition. The author's actions might be seen as a strategic move to eliminate competition by breaking up the couple. However, the story mentions that others on the team agreed the couple was incompatible, so it's not just about competition. \n\nThe emotional impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, is significant. Even if the relationship was unhealthy, causing such a public breakup might be harsh. The author's responsibility here is questionable because they took it upon themselves to act as a mediator, which is not their role.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were well-intentioned but the method was inappropriate. They overstepped by revealing private thoughts, leading to emotional harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
