My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what the other thinks. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author knows that James and Mary are from different social groups and not happy in their relationship but stay together because of debate. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author did this to possibly eliminate a strong competition by breaking up their partnership, which could also affect their debate team. The author argues that James and Mary were incompatible and unhappy, so the breakup was a favor. James blames the author, but others think the author is right.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main ethical issue is whether it's acceptable to interfere in a relationship to benefit one's own interests. The author's motivation seems to be strategic\u2014improving their chances of winning the co-captaincy by dismantling a competitive partnership. However, they justify it by saying the couple was unhappy and incompatible.\n\nBut even if the couple wasn't happy, is it the author's place to intervene? Relationships are personal, and sharing private thoughts without consent can be harmful. The author didn't ask if they wanted to hear the truth, just assumed they needed it. The immediate consequence was emotional distress (James crying), and while others agree it was a favor, the method is questionable.\n\nEthically, intent matters. The author's intent was to help, but the means were manipulative. They used their position to disrupt a relationship for personal gain, which is underhanded. Even if the outcome was positive, the action itself is problematic because it breaches trust and invades privacy.\n\nAlternatively, if the author genuinely believed they were doing the right thing by ending an unhappy relationship, but the approach was wrong. However, the primary motivation was competition, not altruism. That complicates things. The line between helping and interfering for personal benefit is thin here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have helped James and Mary in the long run, the method used was unethical. The author shouldn't have meddled in their relationship for strategic reasons. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
