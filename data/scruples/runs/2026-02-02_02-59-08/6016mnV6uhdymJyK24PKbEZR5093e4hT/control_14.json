My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is on the debate team and planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author discovered that James and Mary, while in a relationship, actually don't get along well and have negative opinions of each other. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a debate meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author didn't have explicit permission from James or Mary to share their private thoughts. Relationships often have elements of privacy, and even if the couple wasn't happy, it's not clear that the author had the right to act as a mediator or spread the information. The author might have thought they were helping, but relationships are complex, and breaking them up based on one person's interpretation of others' opinions could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was staying together because of their debate partnership, not necessarily because they were happy. The author's intention might have been to help them both move on and possibly improve their debate team dynamics. However, the method of revealing private thoughts without consent is a key issue here. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up and were happier), the means of achieving it could still be considered unethical.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"telling it like it is.\" If the author believed that the relationship was harmful to both parties and the couple was aware but stuck, then perhaps the author saw it as a necessary action. However, relationships are personal, and others shouldn't decide for the couple how to handle their issues. The author might have overstepped by not giving the couple a chance to work it out on their own or seeking professional advice.\n\nAlso, the result is that James was crying and blamed the author. Emotionally, this action caused pain, which is a negative consequence. While others on the team agreed it was a favor, the immediate emotional impact on James is significant. The author's action might have been seen as meddling or gossiping, which can damage trust in the community.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the couple's decision to stay together for the sake of debate might have been their own choice, and the author's interference might not have been their place. Even if the author had good intentions, the lack of consent and the resulting emotional harm could make them at fault.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they revealed private information without permission, leading to a breakup that caused emotional distress, even if the outcome was seen as beneficial by others. The key issue is the breach of trust and privacy, regardless of the intentions.\n"
