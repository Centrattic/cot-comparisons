My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by telling each other what they really thought. The author is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with Tim. Their main competition is this couple, but they're from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of debate. So, the author told each of them what the other thought, leading to an argument and breakup.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to help James and Mary by being honest, right? They felt the couple was incompatible but staying together for debate. The author thought breaking them up would make them happier. But James was upset and blamed the author. Others on the team thought the author did a favor.\n\nBut is it right to meddle in someone else's relationship? Even if they are in a bad relationship? Telling someone what their partner thinks about them could be harmful. Maybe the author overstepped. They might not have the right to share personal opinions between the couple. Even if the author's intent was good, the action caused emotional harm. James was crying, which shows the impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was unhappy but staying together for external reasons (debate partnership). Breaking up allowed them to address their issues. The team supported the author, thinking they did the right thing. But relationships are personal, and even if the couple is unhappy, others shouldn't intervene unless they're close friends or there's a risk of harm. The author isn't a friend of James or Mary; they just know them casually. So, the author didn't have the right to intervene here.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be partly to eliminate competition for co-captains. Maybe they thought breaking up the couple would make their own partnership (with Tim) more likely to win. That's a self-serving motive, which complicates things. Even if the author's actions had a positive outcome, the intent and method were questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have helped the couple realize they're incompatible, the author crossed a boundary by revealing personal thoughts between the couple. The action was meddling in a personal relationship without being close to them, which isn't appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
