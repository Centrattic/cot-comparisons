My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author, who's on the debate team, breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by telling each of them what the other thinks. The author's motivation was to help them realize their incompatibility, even though the couple was staying together because of their debate partnership. The result was a breakup during a meeting, with James crying and blaming the author, but others thought the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author had information about the couple's private feelings and shared it without their consent. Even if the couple was unhappy, the act of revealing those thoughts might be an invasion of privacy. Relationships are supposed to be built on trust and communication between the partners. By acting as a mediator and exposing their private criticisms, the author might have overstepped their role, even with good intentions.\n\nAlso, the author's own motives: they wanted to eliminate competition for co-captains. While they claim to have done it out of concern for the couple's well-being, there's a potential ulterior motive related to their own goals. That could mean the action was self-serving, which complicates the moral justification.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the couple. Breaking up a relationship can have significant emotional consequences. Even if the couple was unhappy, the method used here was abrupt and public, leading to emotional distress. The author's approach might have been a violation of the couple's autonomy to handle their relationship matters themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they did the right thing by helping the couple realize their incompatibility. The support from others on the team suggests that some see it as a favor. But just because others agree doesn't necessarily make it right; it's about whether the action was justified, not popular.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical guidelines, there's no law against this, but in terms of personal ethics and social norms, sharing private information without consent is generally considered wrong. The author's role as a friend or teammate doesn't grant them the right to interfere in someone else's personal relationship without their consent.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author likely acted inappropriately by betraying the trust of James and Mary, even with perceived good intentions. Their action caused harm and was based on partial information. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
