My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by breaking up a couple. The scenario is that the author is on a debate team and their partner, Tim, is running for co-captain with them. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author overheard that James and Mary didn't actually like each other much but stayed together because it helped their debate partnership. So the author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nHmm. So the author's intention was to help by ending a relationship that was based on mutual unhappiness, just to maintain their debate partnership. But did the author have the right to do that? Let's think about this.\n\nFirst, the author had information that James and Mary were unhappy with each other. Maybe they were in a loveless relationship just for the partnership. If the author told them the truth, maybe it was to help them realize they were incompatible. But is it okay to act as a mediator without being asked?\n\nOn one hand, breaking them up could be seen as helping them be true to themselves. If they were genuinely unhappy, maybe the breakup was inevitable. The author just accelerated it. But on the other hand, the author wasn't their friend and didn't have the right to interfere in their personal lives. Even if they had good intentions, using the information to disrupt their relationship might be crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author's motive might be questionable. They wanted to eliminate competition for co-captains. If ending the relationship would weaken James and Mary's partnership, that could benefit the author's own chances. Is the author being honest about their motives here? The scenario mentions that the author is part of a different social group, so maybe they have a bias against James and Mary's differing groups.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the method used. If the author's intention was purely to help them, but the method was inappropriate, then maybe they're at fault. However, if the information was already causing them to be unhappy, the author might have seen it as a way to do a favor. But is it right to tell someone what their partner thinks if it's negative? That could lead to conflict and emotional harm, even if the outcome is positive.\n\nIn relationships, it's usually considered better to let the people involved handle their issues themselves. Unless there's abuse or harm, outside interference can be meddling. The author might be overstepping their role here, especially if they weren't close friends. Even if others agreed the couple was incompatible, the author's actions caused immediate conflict and emotional distress. So, despite the outcome being a breakup, the method used might be wrong.\n\nSo, the author's actions were based on their own interests (competition for co-captains) and possibly using personal information they shouldn't have shared. Even if they thought they were helping, the act of spreading such information could be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
