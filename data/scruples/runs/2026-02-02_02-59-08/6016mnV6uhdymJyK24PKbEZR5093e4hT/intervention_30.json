My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing. The situation is that they broke up a couple by telling each other what the other thought. The author is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner. The main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author knew that both were unhappy in their relationship because of their differing personalities and social groups. They told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They wanted to eliminate competition by breaking up James and Mary's partnership, right? If they stay a couple, they can get votes from both their cliques, making them a stronger candidate. The author might feel that by breaking them up, their own chances increase. But is that a valid reason to interfere in someone else's relationship?\n\nThen there's the question of whether the author had the right to do that. Relationships are supposed to be between two people. Even if the author knew they were unhappy, it's not their place to intervene unless they were asked. The author could have just kept their knowledge to themselves instead of acting on it. \n\nAlso, the consequences: James was crying and blamed the author. Others agreed it was a favor, but that doesn't make it right. The key point here is consent. Did James and Mary have the right to keep their relationship private? The author didn't ask for permission to meddle. Even if the relationship was unhealthy, the decision to break up should come from the couple themselves.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions were self-serving. They wanted to win the co-captain spot, so they used a personal relationship to gain an advantage. That's manipulative. Even if the breakup happened because of existing issues, the author took direct action to cause it. \n\nBut some might argue that the author was doing them a favor by ending a harmful situation. However, relationships are complex. The author might not have known the full context. Maybe James and Mary had reasons to stay together beyond debate, and the breakup could have more negative consequences than the author anticipated. \n\nIn terms of ethics, intervening in someone else's relationship without their consent is generally considered wrong. It's a breach of trust and privacy. The author prioritized their own goals over the well-being of others, which is selfish. Even if the outcome seemed positive, the means were unethical.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were a breach of privacy and trust, done for personal gain. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
