My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who's part of a debate team, breaking up a couple (James and Mary) by telling each of them the negative things the other thought about them. The couple was keeping their relationship going only because they were debate partners, and after the breakup, some people thought the author did the right thing, while James was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's intention was to help by revealing the mutual dissatisfaction, thinking it would free them from a harmful relationship. But did they overstep by acting as a mediator or a go-between? Relationships are personal, and even if one party is unhappy, it's their choice to end it. The author might have justified it by saying the couple wasn't happy, but did they have the right to intervene like that?\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. The author had private information about each person's thoughts and shared it without permission. That could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the outcome was positive (the breakup), the method used might be problematic. The author could have approached it differently, like encouraging them to talk to each other instead of directly revealing their thoughts. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the debate team's dynamics. The author's action might have caused unnecessary drama, especially since James was upset. However, others on the team agreed it was a favor, so maybe the long-term effect was positive. But the immediate emotional harm to James, who was crying, is a red flag. \n\nLegal-wise, there's probably no issue, but morally, the author crossed a line by meddling in a private relationship. Relationships require communication, and the author's role in exposing the partners' true feelings without their consent might be considered unethical. Even if the relationship was doomed, the method of ending it was intrusive.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome might have been beneficial for the couple and the debate team, the method used by the author involved sharing private, negative opinions without permission, which is a breach of privacy and trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
