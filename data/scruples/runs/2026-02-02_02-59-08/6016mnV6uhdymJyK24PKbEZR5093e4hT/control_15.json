  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for breaking a couple by telling them what they really think of each other?\nI'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that their relationship isn't happy\u2014James and Mary don't really like certain aspects of each other but stayed together because they're debate partners. The author told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of this. Spreading someone else's private thoughts without permission can definitely be a problem. Even if it's true, sharing that info can cause harm. The author's intention was to help them realize they're incompatible, but maybe they crossed a line. Did they have the right to share that information? Probably not. It's about respecting people's privacy and autonomy. Even if the outcome was positive (breaking up an unhappy relationship), the means were questionable. Also, the fact that James was crying and blamed the author suggests that the method hurt him. The author might have acted out of self-interest (to weaken competition) rather than genuinely wanting to help. Even if others agreed they were doing a favor, that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for overstepping. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
