My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they thought of each other. The scenario is about a high school debate team where the author, part of a debate team, plans to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary had mutual negative opinions but didn't want to break up because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are intent, consent, and consequences. The author's motive was to help by exposing the incompatibility, but the method involved revealing private thoughts without consent. Relationships are private, and sharing someone's private thoughts without permission can be a breach of trust. Even if the outcome seems beneficial (ending a toxic relationship), the means used are questionable. The author didn't consult James or Mary first, didn't confirm the accuracy of the information from both sides, and acted unilaterally. This could be seen as interfering in their personal life for strategic reasons, which might be manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the argument that the author is not in the wrong is that they helped end a harmful situation where both parties were unhappy but stayed together for external reasons. However, the ethical dilemma here is whether the ends justify the means. Even if the intention was good, the method of disclosure without consent could be considered wrong. The author might have overstepped their role as a team member, using personal information for competitive advantage, which could be seen as unethical.\n\nAlso, the impact on James, who was crying and blamed the author, shows emotional harm. Even if others agreed it was a favor, the immediate emotional distress caused by the author's actions is a factor. The author might have prioritized their competitive goals over the well-being of their peers, which is problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the outcome might have resolved an incompatibility, the method used was intrusive and non-consensual. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they meddled in others' relationships without their consent, leading to emotional harm, even if the intention was to help.\n"
