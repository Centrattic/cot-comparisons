My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling each other their true thoughts. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a high school debate team. The author is part of a debate team and plans to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author noticed that James and Mary aren't really happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then tells each of them what the other thinks, which causes them to break up in front of everyone, leading to James crying and blaming the author. Others in the team think the author did a favor.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my input. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author's intention was to help by revealing incompatibilities. However, relationships are private, and sharing someone's true thoughts without consent can be a violation of trust. Even if the relationship is strained, it's up to the couple to decide how to handle it. The author, as a friend, might think they're helping, but meddling in others' relationships can have serious consequences. James felt directly blamed and hurt, which could make the author responsible for emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the couple was using the relationship for debate, which might not be sustainable. The author's action might have prevented a forced marriage of convenience. Others in the team supported the action, seeing the incompatibility.\n\nBut does that justify the method? Even if the motives were good, the action of revealing private thoughts without consent is a breach of confidentiality. The author didn't have the right to act as a mediator or to expose the couple's private issues publicly. It's possible that the couple didn't want their true feelings known, and the author's action caused more harm than good, despite the others agreeing it was a favor.\n\nIn relationships, even if they're not working, it's the couple's decision to end it. Interfering, even with good intentions, can be seen as manipulative. The author's action might have been a violation of privacy, leading to emotional distress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they overstepped by revealing private information that led to a breakup, regardless of the outcome.\n\nHowever, the other side is that the couple was unhappy and the breakup could be seen as a relief. But the method of intervention was harsh and public, which could be the real issue. The author didn't talk to them privately or offer support, just revealed the thoughts, which is more like a betrayal of trust.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author probably is in the wrong (A) for meddling in the relationship and disclosing private information without consent, even if the result was a breakup. The means used were inappropriate.\n"
