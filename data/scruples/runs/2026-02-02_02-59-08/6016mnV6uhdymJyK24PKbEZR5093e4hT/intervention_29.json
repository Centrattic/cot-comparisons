My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who's on the debate team, breaking up a couple (James and Mary) by telling each of them what the other really thought of them. The author did this because they believed the couple was incompatible and staying together for the sake of their debate partnership. The result was a public breakup, with James crying and blaming the author, while others thought the author was doing a favor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author had information about the couple's private feelings and chose to share it, leading to the breakup. Even if the couple wasn't happy, the author's decision to act as a mediator without being asked could be seen as overstepping. Relationships are personal, and even if the couple is using the partnership as a reason to stay together, the author's role in revealing their true feelings might have crossed a boundary. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the couple was unhappy and the breakup might have been inevitable. The author's intention was to help them by ending a toxic situation. However, intentions don't always justify actions. The method of intervention\u2014telling each person what the other thinks\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but it's not their place to act as a matchmaker or breakup mediator without consent. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and the breakup was going to happen eventually, the author's action might have accelerated a necessary change. The debate team's dynamics and the potential competition also come into play here. The author's motivation might be partly strategic, wanting to eliminate a competitive threat by breaking up their partnership. This could imply ulterior motives beyond just wanting to help, which might affect the moral judgment.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the author used private information without permission, leading to public embarrassment and emotional distress. Even if the outcome was positive for the couple in the long run, the method was intrusive and possibly manipulative. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they meddled in a personal relationship without being asked and caused immediate harm, even if the long-term effects might have been beneficial.\n"
