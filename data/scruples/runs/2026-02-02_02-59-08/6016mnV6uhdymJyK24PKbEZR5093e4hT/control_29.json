My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's on the debate team, is planning to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competitors are a couple, James and Mary, who are from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a debate meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's intention was probably to help them break up because they were unhappy and in a bad relationship. But the question is whether the author overstepped by revealing the negative opinions of each other. \n\nOn one hand, James and Mary were in a relationship that wasn't working, and the author's actions caused them to split, which led to James crying. James blames the author, but others think the author did the right thing by freeing them from an unhappy situation. \n\nBut then, is it the author's place to intervene? Relationships are personal, and even if the author had good intentions, did they have the right to act as a mediator or expose private thoughts? Did they get the context right? Maybe the author misunderstood what James and Mary thought of each other. The author might not have considered that the couple might want to work through their issues despite the challenges of being in a debate partnership.\n\nAlso, by causing a public breakup during a meeting, the author might have contributed to an uncomfortable environment. Even if the breakup was inevitable, the method could be seen as harsh. The author's role here as a peer in the debate team doesn't necessarily give them the authority to meddle in personal relationships.\n\nHowever, the other perspective is that the author acted out of a desire to help, noticing that the couple was staying together for the wrong reasons (debate partnership) and not for love. By exposing the incompatibility, they might have done a favor, preventing both parties from being unhappy in the long run. The fact that others on the team agreed suggests that there was a perceived benefit in breaking up the incompatibility for the sake of their well-being and possibly the team's dynamics.\n\nBut then, the line between helping and interfering is thin. The author didn't ask for consent from either James or Mary to share their thoughts. Even if the information was true, sharing it without their permission could be seen as a violation of privacy. Relationships are about the people involved making their own decisions, not third parties imposing their views.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may have had good intentions, the action of revealing private thoughts without consent and causing a public breakup might cross into meddling territory. The author's role in the situation is questionable because they took it upon themselves to act as a matchmaker/breakup agent without considering the personal boundaries and the potential for causing harm, even if the outcome was seen as positive by others. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
