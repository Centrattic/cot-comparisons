My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by breaking up a couple, Tim and Mary, to help their own chances in a debate election. The author is part of a debate team and their partner Tim is running for co-captain with them. Their main competition is another team that's a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together for the debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, but others thought it was a favor.\n\nHmm, the key points here are intent, impact, and the ethical implications. The author's motivation was to eliminate competition for the co-captain position. But by breaking up James and Mary, did they act in bad faith? Even if the couple was unhappy, the author had the opportunity to confront them privately rather than in a public meeting where it could be embarrassing. Also, using personal information obtained through casual conversations to manipulate the situation seems manipulative. While the result was positive for the author's team, the method could be seen as underhanded. The author might have crossed a line by interfering in a personal relationship for their own benefit, even if the couple was already strained. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
