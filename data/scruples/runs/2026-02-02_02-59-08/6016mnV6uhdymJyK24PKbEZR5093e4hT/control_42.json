My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them their true thoughts. The scenario is that the author is part of a debate team and their partner plans to run for co-captains with another team that's a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Did the author have the right to intervene? They might have thought they were helping by ending a harmful situation, but relationships are personal. The author might have acted out of a desire to help, but was it their place to do so?\n\nAlso, how did the author find out about James and Mary's feelings? If it was from casual conversations, maybe they overheard or were told in confidence. If the information was confidential, sharing it could be a breach of trust. But if it was just general opinions the author gathered, maybe not. \n\nThe consequences: the breakup caused an argument in public, James was crying, and others thought the author was doing a favor. So there's a split in opinions. The author's motivation was to help, but the method might be questionable. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple was unhappy, the author's role in ending it could be seen as overstepping. \n\nPossible angles: Did the author have a responsibility to stay neutral? As a competitor, maybe they wanted to eliminate competition, but the story says they think Tim is better. The breakup could have been a side effect of wanting to help. However, manipulating relationships for personal gain, even if unintentional, could be wrong. \n\nAlso, consent: did James and Mary want the author to act as a mediator? If not, the author might have violated their privacy. Even if the couple was unhappy, others might not appreciate someone else deciding their fate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they interfered in a personal relationship without being asked, potentially using information they weren't supposed to share, leading to public embarrassment and emotional distress. Even if the outcome was seen as positive by others, the method was intrusive. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But some might argue B if they think the author helped. Need to weigh both sides.\n"
