My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. The author is part of a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author noticed that both James and Mary weren't happy in their relationship but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting with James crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author had information about how each partner viewed the other and used that information to cause a breakup. The question is whether this action was justified. On one hand, the couple might have been unhappy and staying together for an external reason (debate partnership), so the author might have thought they were doing a favor. On the other hand, revealing private thoughts without consent is a breach of trust and privacy, which can be harmful.\n\nThe author's motive was strategic\u2014since James and Mary were a potential threat as a joint co-captain ticket, breaking them up could help their own chances. But is that a valid reason to interfere in someone's personal life? The line between competition and unethical behavior is thin here. Even if the author believed they were helping, manipulating situations to gain an advantage, especially in a personal relationship, crosses into problematic territory.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The author didn't ask James or Mary if they wanted to know each other's true thoughts. They just decided that revealing these thoughts was the right thing to do, which is assuming they know what's best for the couple. This can lead to unintended consequences, like emotional distress, as seen with James crying. The author's actions caused immediate harm, even if there was a perceived long-term benefit.\n\nAlso, relationships are complex, and third parties can't fully understand the dynamics. By taking it upon themselves to end the relationship, the author might have acted out of their own interests (gaining an advantage in the co-captain election) rather than genuinely wanting to help the couple. The author's role as a debater might involve persuasive skills, but applying that in a personal context without consent is ethically questionable.\n\nIn terms of social consequences, while others on the team agreed the author was doing a favor, that doesn't necessarily justify the action. Group opinion doesn't validate unethical behavior. The author's actions could lead to a loss of trust and credibility, which is important in a team environment.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author acted without consent, potentially out of self-interest, caused emotional harm, and overstepped in a personal matter. Even if the outcome was a breakup that might have happened eventually, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
