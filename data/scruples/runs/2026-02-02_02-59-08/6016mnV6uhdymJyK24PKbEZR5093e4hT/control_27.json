My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by revealing each other's negative thoughts to them. The author's motivation was to help them because they were unhappy but stayed together for debate purposes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author didn't have a close relationship with either person, just casual talks. They decided to tell each other what the other thought, which led to a breakup. James was emotional and blamed the author, while others on the team supported the action.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author overheard or learned private thoughts about each other during casual conversations. By disclosing those thoughts, the author is betraying the trust of both individuals. Even if the intentions were good, sharing personal information without permission can be harmful. \n\nThen there's the question of whether the author had the right to intervene in their relationship. While it's possible that the couple was unhappy, it's not the author's place to mediate their relationship by exposing each other's opinions. The breakup happened in the middle of a debate meeting, which might have been public and traumatic. \n\nAlso, the author's own interests are involved here. They want to run for co-captains and see the couple as competition. This could be a conflict of interest. Their judgment might be biased, thinking that breaking up the couple would help their own candidacy. \n\nIn terms of the debate team dynamics, the couple's differing social groups might lead to a more diverse vote share. The author's action could be seen as undermining the team's unity or strategic partnerships. \n\nOn the other hand, if the couple was indeed unhappy and only staying together for external reasons (like debate), maybe the author helped them realize the truth. However, this doesn't justify the method. Relationships are complex, and breaking them up based on shared negative opinions, even if true, can be seen as meddling. \n\nThe main issue here is the act of revealing private information without consent. Even if the outcome was a breakup that some might see as beneficial, the method used could be considered unethical or harmful. The author might be in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by sharing what they heard, regardless of the intention. \n\nJames being upset and crying shows the emotional impact. The author should have handled it differently, maybe by advising each person to talk to their partner directly instead of spreading the information. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
