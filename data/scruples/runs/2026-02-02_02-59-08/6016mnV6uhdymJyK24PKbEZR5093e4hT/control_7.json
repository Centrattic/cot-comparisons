My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up a couple to help their debate team's chances. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is on the debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner. Their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but stay together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have thought they were doing a favor by ending an unhappy relationship. They believed the couple was staying together solely for the debate team's benefit, which could be affecting their performance. Others agreed that the couple was incompatible and the breakup was for the better.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author acted without knowing the full context. They might have assumed they knew the couple's thoughts accurately based on casual conversations. Telling each other their perceived negative opinions could be seen as meddling. The breakup was public and emotional, causing distress, especially to James who was crying. This could be seen as overstepping boundaries, even if the intention was good.\n\nEthically, is it right to interfere in someone else's relationship? Even with good intentions, the method might be wrong. The author didn't seek consent or consider the emotional impact. While the couple was unhappy, the author's role in causing a public breakup could be problematic. The debate team's dynamics might be affected, and the author's actions could lead to personal and team conflicts.\n\nHowever, if the couple was indeed incompatible and their breakup was inevitable, the author might have just accelerated the process. The team's performance might benefit from having two teams instead of a couple, possibly leading to better competition. Still, the approach was confrontational and led to immediate emotional consequences.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation discreetly. They should have perhaps talked to one person privately first or sought advice before escalating. Publicly causing a breakup, even with good intentions, can be seen as tactless. The author should have considered the potential fallout more carefully.\n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, the author's actions were well-intentioned but poorly executed. They crossed a line by revealing what they thought each person felt, leading to a public and emotional breakup. Therefore, the author is at fault.\n"
