My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their partner, Tim, is a better debater, but the author is better at writing and politics. The main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author overheard that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The author believes they helped by ending an unhappy relationship that was kept together for debate reasons. James blamed them, but others thought the author was right. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical aspects. Telling someone how another person feels about them can be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the author's intention was good, they didn't ask for permission to share that information. Privacy is a big factor here. James and Mary might have kept their feelings private, and the author revealing that could be a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were helping end a toxic situation. The couple was staying together for external reasons (debate) rather than their happiness. If the relationship was harmful or unhappy, maybe the author did a favor. But the method of revealing the truth in the middle of a meeting could be harsh. Publicly causing a breakup might have been more damaging than private. \n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They wanted to remove a competitor, perhaps. If the breakup was strategic to win the co-captains, that's manipulative. But the author claims it was to help them. The line between helping and interfering is thin. \n\nLegal and social norms: There's no law against this, but socially, it's about intent and consequences. If the author acted without consent, it's a breach of privacy. The breakup was immediate and public, which could be seen as cruel. \n\nOthers thought the author was right, but James was upset. The impact on James's emotional state (crying) is significant. Even if the relationship was bad, the way the truth was revealed might have been unkind. \n\nIn summary, while the outcome might have been positive (ending an unhappy relationship), the method was intrusive and possibly caused unnecessary harm. The author might be in the wrong for violating privacy and handling it in a public, harsh manner. Alternatively, if the relationship was genuinely harmful, the author might be justified. But given the lack of consent and the public confrontation, the answer leans towards A (author in the wrong).\n"
