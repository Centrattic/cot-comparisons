My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a debate team where the author, part of a partnership, breaks up another couple (James and Mary) by revealing their mutual negative thoughts. The author did this because they thought the couple's relationship was affecting their debate partnership and they wanted to compete against them for leadership positions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author had information about each person's negative opinions of the other. By sharing that, they caused the couple to break up, which led to emotional distress (James crying). The author's motivation was strategic, to weaken their competition. Even though others on the team supported the action, does that make it right?\n\nOn one hand, the author might argue that they were helping the couple by ending an unhappy relationship maintained only for strategic reasons. On the other, the author used the information they had to manipulate the situation, which could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. Relationships are supposed to be between the individuals involved, and the author stepping in to act as a third party might be overstepping their role. \n\nAlso, the author's conflict of interest here is relevant. Their action was partly self-serving to improve their own chances in the election. Even if the outcome was positive (the couple was incompatible), the method involved using private information to cause a breakup, which can be considered a violation of personal boundaries. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be legally wrong, but ethically, they might have done something wrong. The intent matters here. If the author genuinely believed they were helping, but the means were underhanded, that complicates things. However, the act of revealing personal thoughts without consent is generally seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the manipulation and breach of privacy, even if the outcome had some positive aspects.\n"
