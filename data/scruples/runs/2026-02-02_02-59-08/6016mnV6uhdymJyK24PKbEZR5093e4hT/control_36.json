My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's on the debate team, broke up a couple (James and Mary) by telling each of them what the other thought. The main question is whether the author did the right thing or not.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation was to help Tim and themselves win the co-captain election by undermining the competition. But they also mention that James and Mary were unhappy in their relationship because of their different personalities and social groups. The author overheard or found out that they had negative opinions of each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. Then they told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few things. One is the intent: was the author trying to help them by revealing the truth, or was it manipulative for personal gain? The author admits that breaking up James and Mary could help their own campaign since the couple's unity might split the vote. But they also say that others on the team thought it was a favor, as the couple was incompatible.\n\nOn one hand, honesty can be seen as a good trait, and if both people were unhappy, ending the relationship might be beneficial. However, the author acted as a go-between without permission, which might cross a line. They didn't ask for consent from either party before sharing their partner's negative thoughts. This could be seen as a violation of trust, especially if the opinions were not meant to be shared. Also, the emotional impact is significant\u2014James was crying and blamed the author.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical consideration of meddling in someone else's relationship. Even if the author believed they were helping, intentionally causing a breakup might be considered interfering. The author's actions were strategic for their own benefit, which complicates the moral stance. While the outcome might have been positive for James and Mary in the long run, the method used was underhanded.\n\nSo, considering all factors: intent, permission, and consequences. The author's actions, though possibly well-intentioned, were done without consent and with strategic motives. That makes me lean towards the author being in the wrong because they manipulated the situation for their own advantage, even if it had a positive outcome. The line between honesty and betrayal can be thin here. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
