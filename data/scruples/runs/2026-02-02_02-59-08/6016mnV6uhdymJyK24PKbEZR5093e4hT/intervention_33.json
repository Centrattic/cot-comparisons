My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who's part of a debate team, breaking up a couple, James and Mary, by revealing each other's negative opinions. The author did this because they believed the couple wasn't compatible and were staying together just for the debate partnership.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author isn't a friend of either James or Mary, but they overheard or learned that each had negative thoughts about the other. By sharing these thoughts, the author caused a public breakup during a meeting. James was upset and blamed the author, while others felt the author was helping them out of an unhappy relationship.\n\nI should think about consent. The author didn't ask if James or Mary wanted to hear the other's true feelings. They acted on their own judgment, assuming that the couple's happiness was secondary to the debate competition. But relationships are complex\u2014maybe James and Mary had reasons to stay together despite their issues. The author's action was direct and public, which could be seen as invasive.\n\nIntentions matter. The author's motive was to gain an advantage in the competition by disrupting a potential rival team. However, the justification was that the couple was unhappy. Even if the author's intention was good, the method of intervention was drastic without considering the couple's own decisions.\n\nBoundaries are another factor. The author isn't in a position to meddle in another couple's relationship. Even if the information was true, relaying it without permission breaches trust and privacy. Relationships should be navigated by the people involved, not outsiders acting on their behalf.\n\nConsequences: The breakup happened publicly, causing emotional distress (James was crying). While the couple might have been incompatible, the timing and manner of the breakup could have been handled differently. The author's action might have crossed a line, even if the outcome seemed positive.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome might have benefited the author's team, the means used were intrusive and respect for the couple's autonomy was lacking. The author acted without consent, possibly out of self-interest, and caused emotional harm. So, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
