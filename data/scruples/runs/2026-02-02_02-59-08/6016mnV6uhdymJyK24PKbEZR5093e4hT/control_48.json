My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is on a debate team and their partner is running for co-captains with them. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary actually don't get along well in their relationship but are staying together because they need each other as a debate team. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the right thing by breaking them up. The user is asking if they're at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical implications here. The author overheard or found out that James and Mary have negative opinions of each other but are staying in the relationship for professional reasons. The author decided to reveal these thoughts, leading to a breakup. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships are private. Even if the couple is in a partnership for a common goal, sharing intimate thoughts without permission can be a breach of trust. The author might have thought they were helping by ending a fake relationship, but did they have the right to do that?\n\nOn one hand, the couple was unhappy and staying together for the wrong reasons. The author's action might have saved them from a long-term unhappy situation. On the other hand, the author didn't ask for consent to share those thoughts. It's possible that the couple didn't want others to know their private feelings, even if they were negative. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be to help their own partnership by removing competition. That could be a conflict of interest. Even if the couple was doomed, the author's intervention was direct and led to a public breakup, which could be seen as harsh or unnecessary.\n\nBut others on the team agreed the author was doing a favor. The key here is whether the action was justified. In ethical terms, there's the concept of \"do no harm.\" The author caused harm (emotional distress to James, who was crying) even if the intention was good. However, the long-term harm of staying in an unhappy relationship might be worse.\n\nBut the author didn't have the right to meddle in their private lives. The couple might have wanted to handle their issues on their own. The author's action was a breach of confidentiality, even if the information was negative. So, even if the couple's relationship was flawed, the author shouldn't have acted as a third party to end it.\n\nIn summary, while the outcome might have been for the better, the method was wrong. The author shouldn't have shared others' private thoughts without permission. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
