My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what each other really thinks. The author is part of a debate team and their main competition is another couple, James and Mary. The author found out from casual conversations that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm. The first thing that comes to mind is that the author acted as a mediator, but in a pretty direct way. They took information they overheard or were told in casual conversations and then passed it on, which caused the couple to break up. Now, the user is saying they think the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have thought they were doing the right thing by helping the couple realize they're incompatible. The couple was staying together for strategic reasons (debate partnership) and not because they actually wanted to be together. If they're unhappy, maybe breaking up is better for their well-being. The other team members seemed to agree that the author was doing a favor, so there's support from peers.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't ask the couple if they wanted this information shared. They took it upon themselves to be the messenger, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Also, maybe the information the author gave wasn't accurate? The author only had casual conversations, so there's a risk of misinterpretation. Plus, causing an argument in a public setting (like a debate meeting) could be stressful and emotional for everyone involved. James was even crying, which suggests it was a traumatic experience for him.\n\nAnother angle: relationships are personal. Even if the couple is a partnership in debate, the author isn't in a position to dictate their personal choices. The author's motivation might have been strategic (to take down the competition), but even if not, the method of intervention is questionable. People usually handle such situations by talking directly to each other, not through a third party. \n\nAlso, the author might have overstepped by using information that wasn't theirs to share. Even if the couple was unhappy, sharing private thoughts without consent can breach trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but the means were intrusive. \n\nBut then again, maybe the couple would have broken up eventually, and the author just accelerated the process. If they were unhappy, maybe it's better to resolve that conflict. However, the way it was handled\u2014publicly and without prior discussion\u2014could have been hurtful. \n\nI think the key points here are consent, privacy, and the method of intervention. The author didn't get consent from either person to share their private thoughts. They acted based on secondhand information, which might not have been entirely accurate. Also, the public nature of the breakup could have added to the emotional distress. \n\nSo, even if the outcome was positive (the couple breaking up because they were incompatible), the means by which the author achieved this might be considered wrong. The author's actions crossed into the personal lives of James and Mary without their permission, which is a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
