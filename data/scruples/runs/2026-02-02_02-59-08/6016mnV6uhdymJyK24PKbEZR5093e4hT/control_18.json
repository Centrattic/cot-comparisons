My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're on the debate team and planning to run for co-captains. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy with each other but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, causing them to break up publicly during a meeting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author wasn't a friend with either of them, just had casual conversations. They acted out of a desire to help, thinking the couple was incompatible and staying together for the wrong reasons. But they ended up causing a break-up that led to emotional distress, like James crying.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to do a favor, and others agreed they were helping. But on the other hand, they crossed a boundary by revealing personal thoughts without consent. Relationships are complex, and even if the couple wasn't happy, the author's action might have been an overstep. They might not know the full context of why James and Mary stayed together. Maybe there were other reasons or deeper issues they didn't consider.\n\nAlso, the author's motive could be partially self-serving. By breaking up the couple, they might be removing a competitor for the co-captain position. That adds a layer of selfish intent, which could make their actions more questionable. Even if they genuinely wanted to help, interjecting in someone else's relationship without being asked is generally seen as meddling. Relationships are personal, and it's not up to others to decide if a couple should split, even if they believe it's for the better.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. James was crying, which shows the action had a negative effect. While the author might have thought it was for the best, the method was harsh. A better approach might have been to advise each person to confront the issues on their own rather than revealing the comments directly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were intrusive and perhaps self-motivated. Even if the outcome was seen as positive by others, the method used was problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't have the right to act as a mediator in the relationship and caused immediate harm.\n"
