My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're on a debate team and planning to run for co-captains. They have a partner, Tim, who's a better debater, but the author is better at writing and politics. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, who come from different social groups. The author found out that both James and Mary aren't happy in their relationship but are staying together because of their debate partnership.\n\nThe author then told each of them what the other thought. This led to an argument and them breaking up, with James crying and blaming the author. However, others think the author did them a favor by ending a fake relationship that was keeping them unhappy.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about whether it's right to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if it's for their own good. The author's intention was to help by revealing the mutual dissatisfaction, but it caused immediate conflict and emotional distress. \n\nOn one hand, if James and Mary were already unhappy and staying together for strategic reasons, maybe the author thought they were doing the right thing by pushing them to address their real feelings. But on the other hand, relationships are personal, and inserting oneself into that dynamic without being part of it could be seen as overstepping. The author isn't friends with either of them, just casually talks to them. So, the question is whether the author had the right to share that information.\n\nAlso, there's the context of competition. The author's motivation might be partially to eliminate the competition by breaking up the couple, which could be a selfish reason. Even if they claim it's for the couple's benefit, the ulterior motive complicates things. \n\nEthically, people have a right to privacy in their relationships. Even if the author believed the couple was incompatible, revealing private thoughts without consent could be a breach of trust. The method of delivery\u2014telling each person what the other thinks\u2014sounds like stirring the pot, which might not be fair. Maybe the author should have advised them to talk to each other directly instead of acting as a mediator without permission.\n\nHowever, the outcome was that the couple broke up and everyone else supported the author. But James was upset and blamed the author. The debate team's approval might not outweigh the harm caused to James and Mary. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might have been good, the action of interfering without being part of the relationship and potentially for personal gain (getting co-captain positions) makes the author's action questionable. They didn't consider the couple's autonomy to handle their own issues or the emotional impact of their intervention. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
