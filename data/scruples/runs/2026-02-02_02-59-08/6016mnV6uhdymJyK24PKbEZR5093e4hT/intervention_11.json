My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up a couple by telling them what they really thought of each other. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is on a debate team and wants to run for co-captains with their partner Tim. Their main competition is another debate team that's also a couple, James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary have issues with each other but are staying together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author's intention was to help James and Mary by revealing their mutual dissatisfaction. However, they acted as a third party to spread this information, which directly caused the breakup. Relationships are private, and sharing others' private thoughts without consent can be invasive. Even if the outcome was positive (they broke up), the means involved breaking confidentiality and playing a role in their personal issues. The author might have thought they were helping, but they overstepped by not letting the couple address it themselves. There's a line between giving advice and meddling. The fact that James cried and blamed the author shows the emotional impact. While others agreed it was a favor, the author's action was a breach of trust. So, even with good intentions, the method was wrong. Answer A.\n"
