My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by breaking up a couple, Tim and the author, who are running for co-captains against James and Mary. The author found out that James and Mary, a couple from different social groups, actually don't like each other much but stayed together because of their debate partnership. The author then told each of them what the other thought, which led to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help by revealing the true feelings. They argue that James and Mary were incompatible and staying together for debate was making them unhappy. The result was a breakup, with James crying and blaming the author. Others in the debate team seemed to support the author, thinking they did a favor.\n\nBut is it right to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if the couple is unhappy? The key points here are the author's right to know the truth about their relationship and the method used to reveal it. The author is a high school student, so maybe they're in a different maturity level compared to adults, but that might not matter morally.\n\nEthically, relationships are private. Even if the couple is not happy, the author took it upon themselves to act as a mediator or truth-teller. By telling each person what the other thought, the author caused immediate and public breakup during a meeting. That's pretty harsh. Even if the motive was good, the action could be seen as a breach of trust or privacy.\n\nJames and Mary might have wanted to handle their issues privately. The author's interference led to a public argument, which is more about drama and could have been avoided if they addressed the problems themselves. The author might have overstepped their role as a competitor, using information to sabotage the competition indirectly.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be more self-serving. They want to eliminate a strong competition (James and Mary as a joint ticket) by breaking them up. Even if the author claims it's for their own good, the real reason is to have a better chance at winning the co-captain position. That's a conflict of interest here.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the couple was unhappy and the author just facilitated their separation. But that's a stretch. Relationships are complex, and even if there are issues, it's not up to someone else to decide to end it. The author's actions could be considered a violation of privacy and an invasion of their personal lives.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the outcome was a breakup that made the couple happier, the method was inappropriate. The author shouldn't have shared private information about the couple's feelings without their consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
