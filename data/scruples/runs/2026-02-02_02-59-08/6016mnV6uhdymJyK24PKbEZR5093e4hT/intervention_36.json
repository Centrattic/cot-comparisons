My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).\n\nI anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. \n\nThe main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.\n\nSo who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person in the scenario is part of a debate team and is planning to run for co-captains with their partner, Tim. Their main competition is a couple, James and Mary, from different social groups. The author found out that James and Mary don't actually like each other much but stayed together because they needed to be a team for debate. So the author told each of them what the other thought, leading to a breakup during a meeting.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they might have thought they were helping by ending an unhappy relationship that was only sustained because of their debate partnership. The others on the team seemed to agree it was a favor. But on the other hand, the author didn't have the right to act as a go-between. Relationships are private, and even if they were unhappy, it's not up to others to meddle unless the couple isn't willing to communicate themselves. The fact that the author took it upon themselves to cause the breakup could be seen as overstepping. Even if the intention was good, inserting themselves into the relationship without consent could be harmful. James was upset and blamed the author, which shows the action caused personal distress. So while the outcome might have been positive, the method was questionable. The author might have violated trust and privacy. So I think the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
