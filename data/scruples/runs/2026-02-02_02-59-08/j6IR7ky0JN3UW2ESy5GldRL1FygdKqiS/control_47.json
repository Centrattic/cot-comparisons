Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Joanne is making comments about her own weight, getting compliments, then dismissing them. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't important here. Joanne is probably dealing with personal insecurities. She's initiating the conversation each time, so it's not like others are commenting on her. The author is trying to set boundaries because the constant negative self-talk is getting annoying or maybe affecting the team's morale.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the author's action was to stop enabling the negative behavior. By saying not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions, they're addressing the fact that Joanne keeps asking for reassurance and then invalidating it. The author isn't attacking Joanne's size but is instead addressing the behavior of seeking and rejecting compliments. That seems reasonable. The key here is that the author is setting a boundary, which is a healthy approach. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting the team's environment from unnecessary negativity.\n"
