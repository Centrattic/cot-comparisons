Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The teammates have various body types, and Joanne is someone who's similar in build to the author. \n\nSo, Joanne keeps making negative comments about her own weight, getting compliments from others, and then dismissing their opinions by saying it's only her own that matters. The author finally tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne reacts with an offended look and a dismissive comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Body image issues are common, especially among young women in sports. Joanne's behavior might stem from insecurity. The author's teammates are trying to reassure her, but she's not accepting the compliments. The author steps in after multiple instances, which could be seen as a way to address the recurring issue.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation each time by talking about her weight. The author's response was to stop engaging when Joanne refuses to accept their input. This could be seen as a way to prevent enabling negative self-talk. However, the author might come off as dismissive or not supportive, especially if Joanne is struggling with body image issues.\n\nBut the key point is that Joanne was the one bringing up the topic repeatedly. The author's response is to suggest that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't discuss it. That seems like a reasonable boundary to avoid being pulled into a cycle of negative self-talk. The author isn't attacking Joanne; they're just redirecting the conversation.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author should have handled it more compassionately, perhaps by encouraging Joanne to seek support or by addressing the underlying issues. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time, the author's response is about setting a boundary, not being rude or unsupportive. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
