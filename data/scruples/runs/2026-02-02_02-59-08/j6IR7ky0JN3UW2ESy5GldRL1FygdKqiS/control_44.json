Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author and Joanne have similar body types, and Joanne keeps complaining about her weight and looking in the mirror, then dismissing others' compliments by saying it only matters what she thinks.\n\nFirst, the author tried to be kind by telling Joanne she looks great, but Joanne wasn't satisfied. Then Joanne repeated this behavior with two more teammates, each time getting a compliment and then brushing it off. The author finally tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne reacts with an offended look and says she was \"just saying.\"\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. Joanne is engaging in body negativity, which can be harmful, especially in a team environment. The author is trying to address the situation by setting a boundary after Joanne's repeated behavior. The key point is whether the author overstepped by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nOn one hand, Joanne might feel that she has the right to express her insecurities. But on the other hand, the author and the teammates were giving positive feedback that Joanne was rejecting. The author's action was to stop enabling the negative self-talk by pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want their input, she shouldn't bring it up. This is a form of setting a boundary, which is generally acceptable. It's not about being judgmental but about not engaging in a conversation that's causing discomfort and not being welcome.\n\nAnother angle: in a team setting, supporting each other's mental health is important. If Joanne's behavior is contributing to a negative environment, the author is trying to help by discouraging that behavior. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is instead redirecting the conversation to be more positive or to avoid unnecessary negativity.\n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? Maybe not. They tried to be supportive at first and then set a boundary when the behavior persisted. Joanne's reaction seems to be defensive, which might indicate that the author's approach was justified. The author's action is about maintaining a respectful environment where people don't feel pressured to engage in negative self-talk.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to address a recurring issue in a respectful way. Answer B.\n"
