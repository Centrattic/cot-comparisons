Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. So, the context is a college sports team where weight isn't important. The author's teammate, Joanne, is constantly criticizing her own body, seeking compliments, and then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sport doesn't care about weight, so body image issues might be more about personal insecurity. Joanne is repeatedly seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The author is trying to set a boundary to stop the negativity or the cycle of seeking reassurance. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time, so the author is responding to her behavior. The author's response seems like a reasonable boundary. It's not like they attacked her; they just said to stop if she doesn't want their input. \n\nHowever, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe, but that's about approach, not whether they're in the wrong. The question is about right or wrong, not the best approach. Since Joanne was the one bringing up the topic each time, the author isn't at fault for setting a boundary. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
