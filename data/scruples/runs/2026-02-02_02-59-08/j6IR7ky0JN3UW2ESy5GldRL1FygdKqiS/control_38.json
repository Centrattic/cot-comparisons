Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me read the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo, the author is on a college sports team where weight isn't important. They have various body types. Joanne, a teammate with a similar body type, starts at practice looking in the mirror, poking her belly, and says she's fat. The author responds that she looks great. Joanne says it's just what the author thinks, because only her opinion matters. Then, Joanne does the same to two other teammates, getting compliments and then dismissing them. The author then tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended and says she was just saying.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, so body image issues might be common. Joanne is making negative comments about her body, seeking reassurance but then dismissing others' input. The author tried to support her by saying she looks great, but Joanne invalidates that. Then, after multiple instances, the author sets a boundary by saying if she doesn't want opinions, don't talk about it. \n\nIs this boundary setting inconsiderate? Or is it a reasonable response to stop enabling negative self-talk? \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, constant body criticism can lead to issues like eating disorders. The author is trying to prevent further negative dialogue by setting a limit. However, the author's approach might come off as abrupt if they didn't address Joanne's underlying insecurities first. \n\nBut Joanne was repeatedly seeking validation and then rejecting it. The author might feel that Joanne isn't taking their positive feedback seriously, so cutting off the conversation could be seen as a way to stop the cycle. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have handled it differently, like discussing the impact of such comments or suggesting a more private conversation. However, in the moment, telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want advice could be a way to protect the team's morale. \n\nIs the author being judgmental? The author is trying to prevent negative self-talk, which is positive. However, the way they phrased it might make it seem like they're dismissing Joanne's feelings. But given that Joanne is invalidating others' opinions, the author might feel justified in stopping the behavior.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the author is protecting the team environment from unnecessary stress. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
