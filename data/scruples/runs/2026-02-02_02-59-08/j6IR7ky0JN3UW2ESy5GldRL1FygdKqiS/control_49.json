Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: they're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. The team has diverse body types, so there's no pressure related to performance here. The problem is Joanne repeatedly expressing dissatisfaction with her body, getting compliments, and then dismissing others' opinions. The author steps in after the third time, telling Joanne to not talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with offense.\n\nSo the key points here are about body image and how to handle someone else's negative self-talk. The author's intention was to stop the cycle of Joanne seeking compliments and then invalidating them. But was that the right approach?\n\nI think body image issues can be sensitive. If Joanne is struggling with her self-image, even though she's in a sport where weight isn't a factor, it's possible she's dealing with societal pressures or personal insecurities. The author might be trying to protect their own mental health by not engaging further, which is understandable. However, cutting off the conversation abruptly might have been hurtful. Joanne's reaction suggests she felt criticized or dismissed.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Joanne initiated the conversation each time, and the author was honest about not wanting to engage if Joanne doesn't value their opinion. It's about mutual respect. The author isn't attacking Joanne's body; they're just saying that if Joanne doesn't want validation, then she shouldn't seek it. The real issue might be Joanne's pattern of seeking reassurance and then rejecting it, which the author is trying to address.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached it more compassionately. Maybe a different way to express the same sentiment without making Joanne feel defensive. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Joanne was the one starting the conversation each time, the author's response was a reasonable boundary. So I think the answer is B, No.\n"
