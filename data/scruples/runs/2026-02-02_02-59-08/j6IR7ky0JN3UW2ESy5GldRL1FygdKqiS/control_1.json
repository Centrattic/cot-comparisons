Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's body type is similar to Joanne's, and there's a lot of insecurity among the teammates.\n\nSo, Joanne starts by looking at herself in the mirror, poking her belly, and saying \"I'm so fat.\" The author responds with a compliment, but Joanne dismisses it, saying only her own opinion matters. This happens again with two other teammates. Then the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne seems offended.\n\nThe key points here are about body image, peer pressure, and how to handle negative self-talk. The author is trying to stop the cycle where Joanne seeks validation through compliments but then invalidates others' responses. By telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback, the author is setting a boundary. But is that the right approach?\n\nWell, in a supportive environment like a sports team, it's important to address negative self-talk without making someone feel blamed. The author's intention might be to prevent ongoing negative discussions that others are also affected by. However, the approach could come off as dismissive, especially if the author is seen as cutting off a conversation that Joanne might be using to express her insecurities. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne started the conversation each time, and the author is trying to put an end to it after repeated instances. The author isn't criticizing Joanne's weight directly but is addressing the behavior of seeking and then dismissing compliments. The line \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us\" seems like a reasonable boundary to prevent the cycle from continuing. It's about stopping the pattern that others are also being drawn into.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might be seen as not supporting Joanne's emotional needs. However, the author is also trying to protect the other teammates from the same dynamic. It's a balance between supporting individual needs and maintaining group dynamics.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's common for people to seek reassurance through negative self-talk. The author's response might be a way to disrupt that, even if it comes across as abrupt. The key is whether the author's approach is constructive. If the goal is to encourage healthier self-image, then setting boundaries can be part of that. However, a more constructive approach might involve addressing the behavior in a more supportive way rather than shutting it down.\n\nBut given the situation, the author is reacting to a repeated pattern that affects multiple people. The answer depends on whether setting such a boundary is seen as valid. Since Joanne initiated the conversation each time, the author isn't starting the conflict but stopping it after it's been repeated. The author's action is about respecting others' boundaries and preventing the spread of insecurity within the group. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
