Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Their teammate Joanne keeps talking about her weight, saying she's fat even though others compliment her. The author tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne responds with an offended look and says \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image, the dynamics of the team, and how the author responded. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Joanne is making negative comments about her body in front of others. The author tries to compliment her, but Joanne dismisses it, saying it's her own opinion that matters. This is repeated with other teammates. The author then tells Joanne that if she doesn't want compliments, she shouldn't bring up the topic. Joanne seems offended.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. Joanne is engaging in self-deprecating behavior, which can be harmful, especially in a group setting. The author is trying to stop the negative talk because it's affecting the team's environment. But Joanne might feel that the author is policing her behavior or being dismissive of her feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to create a positive atmosphere by pointing out that Joanne's negative comments make others uncomfortable. It's a way to address the issue directly. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that the author is being judgmental or not respecting her right to express her insecurities. \n\nAnother angle: the author's intent is to stop the cycle of negative self-talk. By saying that Joanne shouldn't talk about it if she doesn't want feedback, the author is trying to break the pattern where Joanne seeks validation but then dismisses it. That could be a valid approach, especially in a team where such discussions aren't necessary for performance. \n\nHowever, the way the author confronts Joanne might come off as abrupt. Maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better, like discussing it privately. But in the moment, the author did what they thought was necessary to stop the behavior. \n\nAlso, considering the team environment, promoting body positivity is important. If Joanne's comments contribute to a negative atmosphere, the author's intervention is justified. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a harmful behavior that affects the group. The response was direct, but the intent was good. The answer should be B (No).\n"
