Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne was making negative comments about her own body multiple times, and the author finally told her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The possible answers are A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a college sports team where body types vary. Joanne, a teammate, has a similar body type and is insecure. She repeatedly comments on her weight, gets compliments from others, but dismisses them. The author intervenes after several instances by saying that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne seems offended.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the right thing. So, the key points here are about body shaming, supporting a teammate, and setting boundaries. Joanne is engaging in self-deprecating comments, which could be harmful. The author is trying to protect the group dynamic by stopping the negative talk. But did they overstep?\n\nIn terms of body image issues, it's important to address negative self-talk. However, the author's approach was to tell Joanne not to talk about it. Is that dismissive? Maybe Joanne was seeking support but then dismissing it, which is a common issue with people struggling with self-esteem. The author's response might be seen as setting a boundary, which is okay if Joanne's comments are making others uncomfortable. But some might argue that the author should have handled it more gently, perhaps by encouraging Joanne to stop the self-criticism instead of cutting off the conversation.\n\nAlso, considering the team environment, fostering a positive atmosphere is important. If Joanne's comments are contributing to a negative environment, the author's intervention could be justified. However, the way it was said might come across as abrupt. Maybe the author could have had a private conversation instead of addressing it in front of others. But in the scenario, the author said it after Joanne did it three times, so maybe they felt it was necessary.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They might have been trying to prevent body shaming and protect their own and others' feelings. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that her comments were her business and that the author overreacted. But since the author was trying to create a positive space, maybe their action is valid.\n\nIn terms of social norms, telling someone not to talk about their own insecurities in public can be seen as shutting them down. However, if others are also being affected (the author mentions Joanne did it to two others), the author's response makes sense. The key is whether the author's approach was respectful. The statement \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us\" is a boundary, but maybe a bit harsh. A better approach might be to express how it makes others feel and suggest a different way to talk about it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention was to create a better team environment, which is positive. The method might have been a bit direct, but the intent was good. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
