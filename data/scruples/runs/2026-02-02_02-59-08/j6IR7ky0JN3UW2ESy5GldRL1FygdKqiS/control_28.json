Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a college sports team where weight isn't important in their sport. The author's teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about her weight in a negative way, like saying she's fat and not accepting compliments. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't care about weight, so there's no objective reason for Joanne to be worried about her weight. But maybe she's dealing with personal insecurities. The author is trying to be supportive by giving compliments but Joanne keeps dismissing them. Then the author says, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" The question is whether this response is wrong.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, when someone is constantly seeking validation but then dismissing the feedback, it can be frustrating. The author is setting a boundary, which is a common way to handle situations where someone's behavior is affecting others. But maybe there's a more compassionate way to approach it. The author might come off as dismissive if they don't offer support instead of setting boundaries.\n\nHowever, Joanne is the one initiating the negative self-talk. The author is trying to stop the cycle by saying that if Joanne doesn't want comments, she shouldn't bring it up. It's a way to break the pattern of seeking compliments and then rejecting them. In group settings, especially in a team, it's important to maintain a positive environment. The author's approach might be necessary to prevent others from feeling pressured to respond each time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached it more gently, perhaps by discussing it privately or offering support instead of making a public comment. But given that Joanne repeated the behavior three times, maybe the author felt it was necessary to address it. The key here is intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the behavior that's causing discomfort, but the impact might have been seen as confrontational.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to address a behavior that was affecting the team's dynamic. It's important to foster a supportive environment where negative self-talk isn't encouraged. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
