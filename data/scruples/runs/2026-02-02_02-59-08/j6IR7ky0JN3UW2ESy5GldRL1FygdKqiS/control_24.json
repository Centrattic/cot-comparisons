Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author, along with Joanne, has a similar body type. Joanne starts talking about her belly in front of the mirror, saying she's fat. The author and two others compliment her, but Joanne responds that it's just nice to hear and that only her opinion matters. After this happens three times with different teammates, the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The author is trying to address repeated comments from Joanne about her own weight, which might be creating a negative environment. The teammates are trying to be supportive by giving compliments, but Joanne dismisses them. The author's response is to suggest that Joanne shouldn't talk about it if she doesn't want feedback. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for their own and others' right to not be put in the position of having to comment on something they're uncomfortable with. It's possible that the repeated comments are making others uncomfortable, and the author is trying to set a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's behavior could stem from insecurity, and the author's response might come off as dismissive or judgmental. However, Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time, so the author might be justified in saying that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't start the conversation. \n\nAlso, considering the team environment, it's important to foster a positive atmosphere. The author's intervention might be necessary to prevent negative body image issues from affecting team dynamics. The fact that Joanne was doing this to multiple teammates suggests a pattern that the author is trying to address collectively. \n\nI think the key here is about setting boundaries in a group setting. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want their input, she shouldn't ask for it. The author's approach is more about stopping the cycle of negative self-talk that others are being caught up in. Since Joanne was the one bringing up the topic each time, the author's response is reasonable. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
