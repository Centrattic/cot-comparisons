Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne repeatedly comments on her own weight, gets compliments, and then dismisses them by saying only her own opinion matters. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue, and there's a variety of body types. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it. The author's response is to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want opinions, stop bringing it up.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation each time by discussing her own body. The author's comment was a direct response to protect her teammates from the negative self-talk. It's about setting boundaries, which is generally a healthy approach. However, maybe the author could have handled it more gently, but the action itself is about stopping someone from self-deprecating in a group where it's not necessary. The key is that Joanne was the one bringing it up each time, so the author's response is a reasonable boundary.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author was standing up for their teammates and themselves by not allowing Joanne to engage in negative self-talk and then dismissing others' input. It's about creating a positive environment.\n"
