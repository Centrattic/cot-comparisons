Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nSo, the context is a college sports team where weight isn't important for their sport. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne is someone with a body similar to the author's. Joanne is often making comments about her weight, like \"I'm so fat,\" and then when others compliment her, she dismisses it by saying only her opinion matters. The author then tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nThe question is whether the author was right to say that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The author was trying to address Joanne's repeated behavior of seeking compliments but then invalidating others' input. The author's response was a direct but not aggressive way to set a boundary. \n\nIn a team setting, constant body shaming or self-deprecating comments can create a toxic environment. Even if Joanne's comments were about herself, others might find it uncomfortable or triggering. The author's intention was to stop the cycle where Joanne seeks reassurance but then dismisses it, which could be harmful to team dynamics and others' self-esteem.\n\nHowever, Joanne might feel that the author was being confrontational or not supportive. But the author's approach was to set a boundary rather than attack Joanne personally. The key here is whether the author had the right to address the behavior. Since the team environment is communal, and repeated negative self-talk can affect others, the author's action could be seen as a valid boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it more privately. But the situation describes it as a public setting (practice) and multiple instances. The author's response was a direct but not harsh way to communicate that the behavior is unwelcome. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author was trying to maintain a positive environment and set a boundary against a behavior that was affecting others. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
