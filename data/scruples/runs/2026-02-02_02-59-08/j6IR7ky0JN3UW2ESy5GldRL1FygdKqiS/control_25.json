Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight in a way that seems to be seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't care about weight, so body image issues might not be sports-related. The team has diverse body types, so there's probably a range of insecurities. Joanne's behavior seems like she's fishing for compliments but then invalidating others' responses. The author is frustrated and sets a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinion, then don't talk about it.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author is trying to address a situation where their teammate is being negative and seeking validation but not accepting it. The author's response is direct but maybe a bit abrupt. However, they are setting a boundary, which can be a reasonable response if the behavior is affecting them. The issue is whether commenting on weight is a sensitive topic and if the author's approach is respectful.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be seen as dismissing Joanne's feelings if they cut her off. But on the other hand, Joanne is using others to validate her insecurities and then rejecting their input, which isn't healthy. The author's approach could be seen as trying to stop the cycle of negative self-talk. The key here is whether the author had the right to set that boundary. Since Joanne's behavior is affecting the team's environment, the author might not be in the wrong. They're addressing an issue that impacts them personally.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're standing up for themselves and trying to create a positive environment. However, there might be a more empathetic way to approach it, but the core issue is about setting boundaries. The author isn't the one causing the problem; Joanne's behavior is the root cause. So the author shouldn't be in the wrong for wanting to stop the conversation.\n"
