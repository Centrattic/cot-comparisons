Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The team has various body types, and Joanne is similar in build to the author. Joanne keeps saying she's fat and then dismissing others' compliments by saying it only matters what she thinks. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team environment and the fact that weight isn't important here. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which might be frustrating for the others. The author's response was to set a boundary. Is that appropriate?\n\nBody image issues are common, especially in college and among athletes. However, if Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her weight and then invalidating others' reassurances, it's reasonable for the author to feel that Joanne is not being genuine in seeking support. The author's comment about not talking about it if she doesn't want opinions seems like a way to stop the cycle. \n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it more sensitively. Instead of cutting off the conversation, maybe suggesting a private chat or expressing concern. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to set a boundary after repeated behavior, which could be seen as a way to protect the group dynamic and prevent others from feeling pressured to give insincere compliments. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel hurt or misunderstood. But the author isn't being cruel; they're just indicating that if Joanne's goal is to get validation without accepting it, others shouldn't have to engage. So the author isn't at fault here. Answer B.\n"
