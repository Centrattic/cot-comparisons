Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has diverse body types. The teammate, Joanne, keeps commenting on her weight, saying things like \"I'm so fat\" and then dismissing others' compliments. The author tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating others' responses. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is understandable. But is that the right approach?\n\nBody image issues are common, especially in sports. The author could be seen as trying to protect their own mental health by not engaging in negative talk. However, Joanne might feel isolated or misunderstood if the author cuts her off. \n\nIs the author wrong? Maybe not. They're setting a boundary, which is their right. But they could have handled it more sensitively, like offering support instead of shutting her down. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No) because the author is asserting their boundaries in a situation where the teammate is being negative and dismissive. It's important to not enable harmful behavior by constantly reassuring someone who isn't open to it.\n"
