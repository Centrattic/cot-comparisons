Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, gets defensive when others compliment her, and the author tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The team has diverse body types, so there's probably a lot of pressure to conform to certain body ideals. Joanne is making negative comments about herself, seeking validation but then dismissing it. The author is trying to stop the cycle by telling her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nIs the author right to do that? Well, the author's intention is to prevent Joanne from seeking and then rejecting compliments. It's a way to stop the behavior that might affect team morale. But was it the right approach? Maybe the author could have addressed it more gently, but the action itself is about setting boundaries. Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to engage in something that's harmful or unproductive. Also, in a team setting, promoting positive body image is important. The author is trying to create a space where such discussions don't happen. So, the answer might be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves and possibly helping Joanne avoid harmful self-talk. But maybe there's a better way to handle it, like a private conversation. However, the action here was a direct response to repeated behavior. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
