Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author is on a team with varying body types and a teammate named Joanne who's been talking about her weight, specifically her belly, in a negative way. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it, saying only her own opinion matters. Then the author told Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for saying that. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking another perspective. The answer needs to be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: Joanne is bringing up her weight multiple times, seeking compliments, and then dismissing the feedback. The author is trying to set a boundary by telling her to not talk about it if she doesn't want their input. The author's action could be seen as standing up for themselves and not engaging in something that's making them uncomfortable (Joanne's negative self-talk and repeated requests for validation).\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that she's being judged or that her insecurities aren't being supported. The author's response could be seen as dismissive or invalidating of Joanne's feelings. However, Joanne initiated the conversation each time, so the author isn't the one bringing it up. The author is setting a boundary after repeated instances, which might be appropriate.\n\nThe key points here are: Joanne's repeated behavior, the author's attempt to be supportive (giving compliments), Joanne's dismissal of those, and the author's boundary. In a team setting, especially in a sport where weight isn't an issue, negative body image talk can be harmful. The author's message is that if Joanne doesn't want their opinion, she shouldn't ask for it. This seems like a reasonable boundary, especially given the context of potential body image issues in athletes.\n\nThe alternative is that the author could have addressed Joanne's behavior more gently, but the action of directly telling her to stop if she doesn't want opinions is a clear boundary. The author isn't attacking Joanne's feelings but rather stating that they're being asked to provide something (compliments) and then rejected, leading to frustration.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether setting that boundary is justified. Since Joanne was the one initiating the conversations, the author has the right to say they don't want to engage further. People can't be forced to give unsolicited opinions, so if someone brings up their insecurities and then dismisses the feedback, it's reasonable to set a boundary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
