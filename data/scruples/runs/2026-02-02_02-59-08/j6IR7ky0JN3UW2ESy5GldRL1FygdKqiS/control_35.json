Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's teammates, including Joanne, have different body types, and there's some insecurity.\n\nSo, Joanne keeps saying she's fat, even though others try to compliment her. The author tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne seems offended but just says \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did the right thing. The user is asking for an AITA (Am I the Asshole) analysis. The key points here are about body image, peer interactions, and how to handle negative self-talk in a group setting.\n\nJoanne's behavior is self-deprecating and possibly seeking validation. The author tried to be kind by complimenting her first, but Joanne dismissed the feedback. The author then set a boundary by suggesting Joanne shouldn't talk about it if they don't want their opinions. That makes sense because Joanne was repeatedly bringing up her weight and then invalidating the responses. The author's response is about not wanting to hear her negative self-talk if Joanne isn't open to positive feedback.\n\nNow, considering the context of a team environment, especially in sports where body image can be a sensitive topic. The author isn't making a judgment about Joanne's weight but is trying to address the pattern of Joanne seeking reassurance in a way that's not productive. The author's comment is about Joanne's behavior, not her body. The response seems reasonable as the author is setting a boundary to stop the cycle of negative comments after multiple instances.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They were trying to address the repeated behavior in a constructive way. The alternatives would be to keep giving insincere compliments or to ignore the issue, but the author chose to communicate their discomfort. Joanne's reaction of being offended might be her own issue, as she's not receptive to others' attempts to make her feel better. The author's approach is about mutual respect and not engaging in negative self-talk. So, the answer should be B (No, author is not in the wrong).\n"
