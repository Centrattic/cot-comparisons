Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne kept commenting on her own weight, getting compliments, then dismissing them by saying only her opinion matters. The author finally told her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. Different body types are present, so body image issues might be common. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then invalidating it. The author's response is to cut off the conversation, which Joanne found offensive.\n\nI should think about intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the cycle of insecurity and maybe protect others from feeling pressured. But did they handle it the right way? Maybe a more supportive approach would be better, like discussing body image concerns without public comments. However, Joanne's behavior was seeking attention and then rejecting the responses, which is manipulative. The author's response was direct, which might be seen as confrontational but also setting a boundary. \n\nAre there any cultural or social factors? In sports teams, camaraderie is important. Body talk can create a toxic environment. The author's action might help in the long run by not reinforcing negative self-talk. But maybe they could have approached it privately instead of in front of others. However, Joanne had done this multiple times, so the author might feel justified in addressing it publicly to prevent others from feeling they need to comment.\n\nIs the author wrong? If the problem is that Joanne was constantly seeking validation and then dismissing it, the author's response is a way to stop the behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So answer B, No.\n"
