Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The scenario is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Joanne frequently comments on her own weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author, after Joanne does this a third time, tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and there's already a lot of insecurity. Joanne's behavior seems to be a pattern of seeking validation but then invalidating others' responses. The author's response is a direct way to stop the cycle. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't attacking Joanne. They're setting a boundary, saying that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. That's a reasonable response to prevent others from having to engage in what could be a toxic conversation. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it? The author could have approached it more gently, but the act of setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. Joanne's behavior might be harmful to the team's morale, especially if others are also dealing with their own insecurities. The author is trying to protect their own and others' feelings by not engaging further. \n\nThe key points are that Joanne's comments are recurring and dismissive, leading to the author's frustration. The author's response is a way to stop the negative behavior. Since the problem is Joanne's actions, not the author's response, the author is justified. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
