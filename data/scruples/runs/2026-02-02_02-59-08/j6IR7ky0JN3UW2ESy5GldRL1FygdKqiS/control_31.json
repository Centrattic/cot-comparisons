Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is on a college sports team where weight doesn't matter. Their teammate Joanne keeps talking about her weight, saying things like \"I'm so fat,\" and then when others try to compliment her, she dismisses their opinions. After multiple instances, the author tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The team has a variety of body types, which suggests that body image issues might be a common problem there. Joanne is making negative comments about her own body, and others are trying to offer reassurance, but she's not accepting it. The author is frustrated and finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their input.\n\nIs the author right to set that boundary? Well, Joanne is repeatedly engaging in self-critical behavior and invalidating others' attempts to support her. By saying \"maybe don't talk about it around us,\" the author is essentially setting a boundary to stop the negative self-talk. But does that cross a line?\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect their own mental health by not engaging in conversations that make them uncomfortable and are promoting negative self-image. It's important to set boundaries when someone's behavior is affecting others. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that the author is being dismissive or not supportive. However, Joanne was the one who, every time someone tried to compliment her, she'd say that their opinion doesn't matter. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're responding to Joanne's own dismissal.\n\nAlso, in a team setting where body image isn't a factor in performance, it's reasonable for the author to encourage focusing on positive aspects rather than self-criticism. The author's response is a way to stop the cycle of negativity. It's about mutual respect\u2014Joanne initiated the conversation, and the author is asking her to respect their boundaries by not continuing it.\n\nI think the key point here is that Joanne was the one initiating the negative self-talk and dismissing others' support. The author's response is a boundary to stop the behavior, which is a reasonable and healthy approach. The author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for their own comfort and trying to foster a more positive environment. Joanne's behavior is the issue, not the author's response to it.\n"
