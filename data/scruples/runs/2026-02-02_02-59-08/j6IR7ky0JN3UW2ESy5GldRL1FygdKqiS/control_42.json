Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The writer's teammate, Joanne, keeps expressing insecurity about her weight and seeking compliments, then dismissing others' opinions. The writer finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne's behavior is causing issues. The writer's response was direct but seems to be setting a boundary. The main question is whether the writer overstepped or handled it appropriately.\n\nJoanne's actions involve repeatedly bringing up her insecurities, which can create a negative environment. The writer's response was to call out her behavior, which might be seen as standing up for others or being insensitive. However, the writer's intention was to stop the cycle of seeking validation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the writer's teammates were uncomfortable with Joanne's behavior, then the writer was advocating for their comfort. However, the method of confrontation matters. The writer's statement was a bit abrupt, but in a team setting, addressing such issues can be necessary. So, the answer might be B because the writer was protecting the team's well-being by stopping the negative behavior.\n"
