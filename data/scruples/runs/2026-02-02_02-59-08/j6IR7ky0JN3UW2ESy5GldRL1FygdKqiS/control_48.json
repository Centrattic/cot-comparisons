Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is part of a college sports team where weight isn't important for the sport. They have various body types, and Joanne, a teammate with a similar body, is making negative comments about her weight. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it, saying only her own opinion matters. This happened to two other teammates as well. Finally, the author told Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want their opinions, and Joanne was offended.\n\nSo, the author's action was to set a boundary after Joanne's repeated negative self-talk. The key points here are the context of the environment (sports team where weight isn't a factor), the frequency of Joanne's behavior (multiple instances with different teammates), and the author's response. \n\nI should consider if the author overstepped. Joanne was talking about her own body, which is a personal topic. However, if she's doing this in a group setting where others are uncomfortable or it's affecting the team's dynamics, then the author's intervention might be justified. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne kept invalidating others' opinions. Maybe the author felt that Joanne was seeking validation but then dismissing it, which could be frustrating. \n\nIs it appropriate to tell someone to stop talking about their weight if it's causing discomfort? It depends on the intent and the approach. The author's response was direct, which might have come across as harsh, but considering the repeated behavior, maybe it was a necessary boundary. Also, the fact that Joanne was doing this to multiple people suggests it's a pattern, not just a one-time comment. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's self-criticism might be a sensitive issue, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive or not supporting. But the author's point is that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. It's about respecting boundaries on both sides. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they were standing up for themselves and others after repeated negative self-talk. The environment is a team where body image issues might be exacerbated, and the author's intervention could help create a more positive space. The key is that the author was trying to address the behavior after it happened multiple times, which shows they were patient initially. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
