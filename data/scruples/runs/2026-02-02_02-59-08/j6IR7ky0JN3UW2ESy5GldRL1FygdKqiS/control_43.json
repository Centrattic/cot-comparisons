Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author confronting a teammate, Joanne, who is making negative comments about her weight. The author tells Joanne to stop talking about her weight around them because Joanne is seeking validation and then dismissing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't relevant to their sport. Joanne is slim and muscular but still insecure. She's repeatedly making self-deprecating remarks, getting compliments from teammates, and then invalidating them by saying only her opinion matters. The author then tells her to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nIs the author wrong here? Well, the author is trying to address the behavior of seeking validation and then dismissing others' input. The author's intention seems to be to set a boundary for themselves, not to hurt Joanne's feelings, but to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and the game of seeking approval. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way to handle it? Like addressing it more compassionately or privately. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Joanne initiated the negative comments each time and the author is responding to protect their own emotional space, especially in a team environment where such comments could affect others, the author might be justified. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. But the action itself\u2014setting a boundary\u2014isn't necessarily wrong. The author isn't attacking Joanne's appearance but rather her behavior of constantly seeking and then dismissing feedback. So the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
