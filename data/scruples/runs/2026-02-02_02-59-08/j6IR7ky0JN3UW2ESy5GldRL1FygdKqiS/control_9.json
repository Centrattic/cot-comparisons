Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, getting affirmations from others, then dismissing their input. The author tells her not to talk about it if she wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't care about weight, so body image issues might be common. Joanne is repeatedly seeking validation but then invalidating it. The author steps in after Joanne does this multiple times. The key points are about respecting boundaries and addressing negative self-talk.\n\nThe author's response was direct but not harsh. They're pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't ask for it. This could be seen as setting a boundary to prevent others from feeling pressured to comfort her. However, maybe the author could have approached it more sensitively, like expressing concern instead of a reprimand.\n\nBut Joanne was the one initiating the conversations each time. The author isn't attacking her body; they're addressing the behavior of seeking and dismissing opinions. The team environment needs to support each other, but constant self-deprecation can create a toxic atmosphere. The author might be trying to stop that cycle.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a recurring issue that's affecting the team's dynamic. However, maybe there's a way to handle it more constructively. But given the situation, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
