Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario did something wrong by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne is making negative comments about her body, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback. Joanne reacts defensively.\n\nSo, the key points here. Body image issues are common, especially in young women. The author is trying to address the constant negativity and maybe the cycle of seeking validation. But was it wrong to set that boundary?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for themselves and others by saying that if Joanne doesn't want input, she shouldn't bring it up. It's about respecting personal boundaries and not forcing others to engage in negative self-talk.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gently. Telling someone to stop talking about their insecurities might come off as dismissive. But Joanne was already invalidating others' input each time. The author's response was after multiple instances where Joanne kept doing this.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Since Joanne was the one initiating the conversations and then rejecting the feedback, the author's response seems like a reasonable boundary. It's about mutual respect. If Joanne didn't want opinions, she shouldn't prompt for them. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer is B.\n"
