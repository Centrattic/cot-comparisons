Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's teammate, Joanne, keeps commenting on her own weight in a negative way, like saying \"I'm so fat,\" and then when others compliment her, she dismisses their opinions. The author finally tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nHmm. The first thing that comes to mind is body image issues. Joanne seems to be struggling with her self-image, which is a sensitive topic. The author is trying to support her by giving positive feedback but Joanne isn't accepting it. The author then sets a boundary by saying if she doesn't want opinions, don't mention it around them. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, Joanne started the conversation by talking about her weight in a negative way. The author tried to be supportive, but when Joanne keeps doing it, the author is protecting the group's dynamics. By setting that boundary, the author is probably trying to create a more positive environment. \n\nBut wait, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe. Instead of cutting off the conversation, maybe they could have had a private talk with Joanne about how those comments affect others. However, the author did try to give positive feedback first. Joanne's behavior might be triggering others' insecurities too. The author's response was to stop engaging when Joanne's comments became a pattern. That seems reasonable because if someone keeps bringing up negative self-talk, it's okay to set limits. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a sports team, maintaining a positive atmosphere is important for morale and performance. The author is probably trying to help by not letting negative comments fester. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
