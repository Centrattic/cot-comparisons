Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is part of a college sports team where body image isn't a factor in performance. They have a teammate, Joanne, who's similar in build but seems to have a lot of insecurity about her weight. The key points here are Joanne's repeated comments about her body and the user's reaction.\n\nFirst, Joanne starts by complaining about her belly, then the user compliments her. Joanne dismisses the compliment, saying only her opinion matters. Then she does the same to two more teammates. The user finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne is offended.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. So, the user was trying to set a boundary after Joanne's repetitive behavior. The user's main issue is that Joanne keeps seeking validation and then invalidating others' input. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, body image issues are common, especially in young adults. But when someone repeatedly brings up insecurities and then shuts down support, it can create a toxic environment. The user's response might be seen as standing up for themselves and others who are being put in awkward situations. However, the user could have approached it with more empathy. Instead of a direct reprimand, maybe addressing it privately or expressing how her comments make them uncomfortable.\n\nBut the user's action was a direct response to Joanne's pattern of behavior. They weren't attacking her but setting a boundary. In group settings, especially with peers, it's important to maintain a supportive environment. If Joanne's comments are causing distress, the user's intervention is justified. However, the method might have been abrupt. The user might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it more sensitively.\n\nConsidering all angles, the user's intent was to stop a harmful pattern, so they're probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
