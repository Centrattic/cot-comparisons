Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that they're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps complaining about her weight, getting compliments, but then dismissing them by saying it's only what she thinks. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nHmm. So Joanne is engaging in negative self-talk, maybe even body shaming herself. The author is trying to support her by giving compliments but gets annoyed when Joanne dismisses them. The key point is that the author sets a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinion, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for themselves. They're not attacking Joanne but are asking her to respect the fact that they don't want to engage in that conversation when Joanne first brings it up. The problem might be that Joanne is creating a negative environment with her comments, and the author is trying to avoid enabling that behavior. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently, like addressing it more privately or using a different approach. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since Joanne was the one bringing up the topic and the author is setting a boundary, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They're protecting themselves from unnecessary negativity and not allowing others to dismiss their input.\n"
