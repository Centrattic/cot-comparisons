Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The author's teammate Joanne frequently expresses insecurity about her body, even when others try to reassure her. The author finally tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't important for their sport. Joanne is making negative comments about her body, which could foster a negative environment. The author is trying to stop the cycle of insecurity by setting a boundary.\n\nJoanne's behavior seems to be seeking reassurance but then dismissing it. The author's response is a direct way to address that. It's about setting limits on what's discussed in the group. The key here is whether the author overstepped or if it's a reasonable boundary.\n\nPossible angles: Body image issues are common, especially in sports. Encouraging positive body image is good. However, Joanne's actions might be perpetuating a negative environment. The author is trying to protect the team's morale. But maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively, like talking to Joanne privately instead of publicly calling out her behavior. \n\nHowever, the author's statement is a bit indirect. They said, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" This is a way of saying that Joanne's bringing up her weight invites opinions, which she then rejects. The author isn't attacking Joanne but pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nIs this the wrong approach? It depends on intent and delivery. If the author's intention is to stop the negative dialogue, it's reasonable. But in a group setting, maybe a private conversation would be better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If Joanne was being hurtful or if others were affected, then the author's action is justified. The team's well-being matters. \n\nAnother angle: Joanne might feel singled out, but the author is trying to prevent others from being drawn into her insecurity. The author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a behavior that could spread negativity. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They set a boundary to stop unnecessary negative talk, which is important for a healthy team environment.\n"
