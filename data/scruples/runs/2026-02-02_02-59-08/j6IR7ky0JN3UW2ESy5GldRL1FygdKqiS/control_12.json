Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in build to the author and others, but seems to have body image issues.\n\nSo, Joanne keeps making negative comments about her weight, seeking reassurance from teammates, but then dismissing their compliments. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with offense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address a pattern of behavior where Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The author's response is a direct way to stop the cycle. Is that appropriate?\n\nBody image issues are a serious problem, especially in environments where physical appearance can be under scrutiny, even if the sport isn't weight-dependent. The team has a variety of body types, which suggests that there's no one \"ideal\" body. Joanne's behavior might be a sign of her own insecurities, and the author is trying to set a boundary.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as abrupt. Maybe a more supportive method would be better, like addressing her feelings in a kinder way. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for the specific action taken. The key point is that Joanne was seeking compliments and then dismissing them, which can be frustrating for others. The author's response is a way to communicate that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's generally acceptable to set boundaries around conversations that are causing discomfort. The author isn't criticizing Joanne's weight; they're asking her to stop initiating a topic that the group finds unhelpful. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
