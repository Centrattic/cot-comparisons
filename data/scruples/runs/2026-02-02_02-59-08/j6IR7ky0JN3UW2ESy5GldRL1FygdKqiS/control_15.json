Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is at a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author and Joanne have similar body types, but Joanne keeps making comments about her weight, even after receiving compliments. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't care about weight, so there's no performance reason for Joanne's comments. The team is diverse in body types, which might contribute to the insecurity. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then dismissing others' opinions, which could create a negative environment.\n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary after Joanne repeated the behavior. The key here is whether the author overstepped or acted appropriately. If Joanne was using these moments to seek reassurance and then invalidating others' input, the author's intervention might be justified to prevent a toxic atmosphere. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is asking her to stop bringing up the topic if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like addressing it privately or encouraging a healthier mindset. But given that Joanne was pushing the issue repeatedly, the author's direct response might be necessary to stop the cycle. The team's well-being and mental health are important, especially in a sport where body image issues are common. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves and the team's environment. The answer should be B.\n"
