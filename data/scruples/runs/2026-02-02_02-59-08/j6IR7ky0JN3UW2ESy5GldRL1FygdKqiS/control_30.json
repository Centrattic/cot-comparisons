Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. So first, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe background is that the author is on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. They have various body types, and one teammate, Joanne, has a similar build. The author notices that Joanne is commenting on her own weight in a negative way, saying she's fat. The author responds positively, but Joanne dismisses the compliment, saying only her own opinion matters. Then Joanne does this with two other teammates, and each time, after they give a compliment, she says their opinions don't matter. Finally, the author tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let me think. The key points here are about body image, peer interactions, and setting boundaries. Joanne is clearly struggling with her self-image, which is a common issue, especially in young adults. However, the author and others are trying to offer support through compliments. But Joanne isn't accepting it, which might be because she feels insecure or maybe she's trying to provoke reactions. The author then sets a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nIs the author wrong to do that? Well, setting boundaries is generally a positive thing. If someone is making others uncomfortable or expecting validation, it's reasonable to ask them to stop. However, the author's approach might have come off as harsh. Instead of a direct \"stop talking about it,\" maybe a more supportive approach could be better. But the alternative is that Joanne is creating a negative environment with her comments, and the author is trying to protect themselves and others from that.\n\nAnother angle is that Joanne might be using the teammates as a way to seek reassurance but then invalidating their responses. The author's response is a way of saying that the team's opinions do matter, and if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't solicit it through self-deprecating comments. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author's intention seems to be to address the negative behavior, whereas Joanne's actions are potentially fostering insecurity in others. The author isn't bullying Joanne; they're responding to a pattern that's affecting the team dynamic. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I should also consider if there's a better way to handle it. However, the question is about fault, not about the best possible action. The author's response is a reasonable boundary, so I think B is correct.\n"
