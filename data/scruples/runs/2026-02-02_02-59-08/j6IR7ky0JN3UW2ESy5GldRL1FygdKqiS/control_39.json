Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, Joanne is a teammate on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has various body types, and there's some insecurity. Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, poking her belly, and then frowning. Each time, the author and others try to compliment her, but Joanne responds by saying it's just what they think. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author overstepped. Joanne was making negative comments about her body in a group setting. The author tried to be supportive, but Joanne dismissed their feedback. Repeating this with others might create a cycle of insecurity and unnecessary self-criticism. The author's response is to set a boundary, which could be seen as protecting their own mental health or preventing the spread of negative self-talk.\n\nBut is that the right approach? Telling someone to stop talking about their body, even if it's negative, could be seen as invalidating their feelings. On the other hand, the author might be trying to stop the cycle of seeking validation and then dismissing it. The key here is the intent and the method. The author's comment was direct, which might come off as harsh, but the situation involves repeated behavior that others find uncomfortable.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary in response to persistent behavior. However, maybe a better approach would have been to address it more sensitively, like discussing it privately. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer would hinge on whether the author's action was justified. Since Joanne was the one initiating the negative self-talk repeatedly, the author isn't wrong for trying to stop it. So the answer is B.\n"
