Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author, let's call them Alex, is talking to a teammate named Joanne. Joanne keeps complaining about her weight and then dismissing others' compliments.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if Alex did something wrong by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The key points here are about body image issues, the dynamics between teammates, and the author's response.\n\nJoanne is making negative comments about herself, probably in front of others. She's seeking validation but then invalidates it. The author steps in after the third time, telling her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. The question is whether Alex overstepped or was justified.\n\nI should consider if body shaming is involved. Joanne is talking about her own weight, so maybe she's struggling with self-image. But then she's spreading that negativity, which could affect others. The author is trying to stop her from continuing that behavior because it's creating an uncomfortable environment. \n\nIn sports teams, especially, a positive environment is important. Constant negative comments about weight might contribute to a toxic atmosphere. The author's intervention was direct but not confrontational. They said, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" That's a way of saying, \"If you're going to bring it up, accept the feedback,\" which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, Joanne's response was defensive, which might indicate she felt criticized. But the author didn't directly criticize her; they just set a boundary. So, the author is not in the wrong here. They were protecting the team's environment from unnecessary negativity. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people in the same sport face body image issues. The author might have felt that Joanne's comments were leading others to be self-conscious. By stopping her, the author is promoting a healthier mindset. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary when someone else is making negative self.comments repeatedly, especially in a group setting where it can affect others.\n"
