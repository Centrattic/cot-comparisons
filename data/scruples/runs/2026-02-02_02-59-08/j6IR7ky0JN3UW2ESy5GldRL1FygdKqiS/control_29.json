Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where a teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about her weight and then dismisses others' opinions. The author tells Joanne to stop talking about it since she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't important for their sport. Joanne is being insecure and seeking compliments, then invalidating the responses. The author steps in after three instances to set a boundary.\n\nI should think about the dynamics here. Body image issues are common, especially in young adults. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking reassurance but then rejecting it, which can be frustrating for others. The author's response is about respecting each other's boundaries. If Joanne brings up her weight, others might feel uncomfortable or pressured to respond. The author is saying that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't solicit it. That seems like a reasonable boundary.\n\nBut is there a problem with the author's approach? Maybe they could have addressed it more gently, but the main issue is that Joanne was creating a negative environment. The author isn't bullying Joanne; they're just pointing out that her actions are leading to unwanted feedback. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is setting a boundary to stop the cycle of insecurity and unwanted comments, it seems justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
