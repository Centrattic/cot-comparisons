Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that the teammate, Joanne, keeps making negative comments about her body, and the author tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't important for their sport. Joanne is similar in build to the author, and there's general insecurity. Joanne makes self-deprecating remarks three times, each time getting compliments but dismissing them. The author finally says that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne seems offended.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key points here are about body image, peer pressure, and boundaries. Joanne is engaging in negative self-talk and possibly seeking validation but then dismissing others' positive feedback. The author's response is to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want the opinions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author had the right to set that boundary. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the team's environment from negative body image talk, which can be harmful. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that the author is being dismissive or judgmental. However, the author's statement is a direct response to Joanne's repeated behavior. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is instead pointing out the inconsistency in her actions. \n\nAlso, considering that weight isn't relevant to their sport, the focus on body image seems unnecessary. The author is likely trying to foster a positive environment. Setting boundaries in such situations is often seen as appropriate, especially when someone's behavior is affecting others. \n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. If Joanne is seeking compliments and then invalidating them, it could be a pattern that others find uncomfortable. The author's intervention might be necessary to stop the cycle. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're addressing a recurring issue in a respectful way. The answer should be B.\n"
