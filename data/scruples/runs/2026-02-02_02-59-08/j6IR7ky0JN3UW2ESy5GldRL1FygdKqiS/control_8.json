Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps complaining about her weight, gets compliments, and then dismisses them, saying only her opinion matters. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where body types vary, and there's existing insecurity. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can create a negative environment. The author's response is to set a boundary, which might be seen as standing up for others or being overly direct.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if Joanne initiated the conversation seeking compliments but then shuts down feedback, the author's frustration is understandable. The team has different body types, so focusing on weight isn't relevant. The author is trying to stop the negative self-talk, which could be seen as protective of the team's morale. However, the author's approach might come off as abrupt or dismissive of Joanne's feelings. \n\nBut considering that Joanne was repeatedly doing this to others, the author's intervention could be justified as addressing a pattern of behavior that's affecting the team. The key is whether the author overstepped by telling her not to talk about it. Since Joanne started the conversation, the author's response might be seen as a necessary boundary to prevent others from having to engage in unwanted validation-seeking. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're addressing a recurring issue that's creating a negative environment, and setting boundaries is important in such cases.\n"
