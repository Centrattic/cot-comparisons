Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight.\n\nSo the situation is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own body, saying she's fat, and the author tries to reassure her. But Joanne then invalidates the author's opinion by saying it's only what she herself thinks. This happens three times with different teammates. The author finally says that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up around them. Joanne gets offended.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The team has diverse body types, and there's a lot of insecurity among the women. The author's teammates are seeking validation but then dismissing others' input. The author is trying to set a boundary when their reassurances aren't helping.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting that boundary? Well, Joanne started the conversation by talking about her body. The author's response was polite at first, but after multiple instances, they decided to stop engaging. That makes sense because if someone is seeking validation but then rejecting others' input, it's frustrating. The author isn't attacking Joanne; they're just saying that if Joanne doesn't want their opinion, she shouldn't ask for it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe Joanne is dealing with her own insecurities and the author's response could come off as dismissive. However, the author's approach was to set a boundary rather than to be cruel. In a team setting, it's important to support each other but also respect boundaries. If Joanne is seeking compliments and then invalidating them, the author has a right to step back to protect their own mental health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a healthy boundary in response to repeated behavior that's uncomfortable. Answer B (No) seems appropriate here.\n"
