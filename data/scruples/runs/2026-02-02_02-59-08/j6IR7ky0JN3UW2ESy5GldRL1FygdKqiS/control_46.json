Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The teammate, Joanne, is making negative comments about her body, and the author tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has various body types, and weight isn't important. So Joanne's focus on her weight might be unnecessary. The author is trying to stop the negative self-talk. But Joanne keeps doing it, and the author confronts her.\n\nIs the author right to step in? Well, body image issues are common, especially in young women. The author might be trying to protect their teammate and others from harmful comments. But Joanne might feel that her feelings are being dismissed. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to say that if she doesn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. That could be seen as standing up against toxic behavior. The team environment should probably support each other without body shaming. The author isn't attacking Joanne but setting a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed it more sensitively. But given that Joanne was repeatedly doing this, the author's reaction might be justified. The key here is that Joanne was seeking validation but then dismissing others' input, which can be manipulative. The author is trying to stop that cycle.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're promoting a positive environment and setting boundaries against negative self-talk.\n"
