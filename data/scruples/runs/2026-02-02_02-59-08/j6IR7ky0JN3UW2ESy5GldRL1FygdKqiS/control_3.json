Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) was wrong to tell Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't important. The author and Joanne have similar body types, and Joanne is insecure. She's been making negative comments about her body and then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The team is diverse in body types, and Joanne's behavior might contribute to a negative environment. Body image issues are common, especially among young athletes. The author's response was to set a boundary, which could be seen as protecting the team atmosphere. On the other hand, Joanne might feel her feelings are being dismissed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was trying to address a pattern where Joanne was seeking validation but then rejecting it. The author's comment was a direct response to stop the cycle. It's possible that a better approach could have been to talk to Joanne privately, but given that she repeated the behavior with others, the author's public response might be justified to prevent others from being put in the same position. \n\nThe key points are intent and context. The author's intent was to stop the negative behavior that affects the team. The team environment should be supportive, and constant negative self-talk can be harmful. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
