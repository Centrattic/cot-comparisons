Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) was wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has diverse body types, so there's probably a lot of body image pressure. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in build to the author. She's been looking at herself in the mirror, complaining about her belly, and saying \"I'm so fat.\" The author tries to compliment her, but Joanne dismisses the compliments, saying only her own opinion matters. This happens three times with different teammates. Then the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address Joanne's repeated negative self-talk. Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating others' responses. The author's response is to set a boundary: if Joanne doesn't want to hear their opinions, then she shouldn't bring it up. That seems like a reasonable boundary, especially in a group setting where others are being pulled into this cycle. The author is protecting the group from Joanne's behavior, not just themselves. \n\nPossible angles where the author could be in the wrong: maybe it's not their place to tell Joanne to stop? But Joanne is involving others each time, so the author's intervention is to stop the pattern. Also, the author is trying to support their teammates by not letting the conversation continue. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might be feeling sensitive, but she initiated the conversation each time. The author's response is a direct and clear boundary, which is healthy. It's not about judging Joanne's body but about how the conversation is affecting the group. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
