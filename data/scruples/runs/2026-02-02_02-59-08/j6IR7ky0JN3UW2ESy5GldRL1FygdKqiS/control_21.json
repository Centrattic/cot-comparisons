Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where one teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about her weight in a negative way. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it. Then the author told Joanne to stop talking about her weight because she wasn't interested in their opinions if they weren't valued. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The sport doesn't focus on weight, so body image issues are probably common among the athletes. Joanne is clearly struggling with her body image, as she's looking in the mirror and poking her belly. The author tried to be supportive by saying she looks great, but Joanne responds that it's only her own opinion that matters. Then she repeats this behavior with two others. The author's response is to tell Joanne not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Joanne's actions are seeking validation but then dismissing others' opinions. The author might be frustrated with the constant negativity and the invalidation of their attempts to be supportive. By saying \"if you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us,\" the author is trying to address the cycle where Joanne seeks affirmation but then negates it. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel hurt or defensive because she's dealing with her own insecurities. The author's approach could be seen as dismissive or not addressing the root problem. However, the author is also trying to prevent a conversation where they give compliments that aren't appreciated. \n\nThe key here is whether the author was in the wrong by setting that boundary. The author wasn't attacking Joanne but was directing the conversation away from something that was causing discomfort. In a team setting, it's reasonable to want to avoid constant negative self-talk, especially when it's not productive. \n\nSo the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is standing up for themselves to stop a pattern of behavior that's unproductive and possibly harmful. The author's response is a reasonable boundary to avoid enabling the negative self-talk by providing unappreciated compliments.\n"
