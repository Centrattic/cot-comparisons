Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The teammate, Joanne, keeps commenting on her own weight, looking in the mirror, and then dismissing the compliments given by others. The author eventually tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it around others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and the sport isn't weight-dependent. Joanne's behavior seems to be about her own insecurity. The author tried to reassure her, but Joanne downplayed their input each time. The author's final comment was a direct response to Joanne's repeated behavior. \n\nNext, I should think about the dynamics of the situation. Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating the responses she gets. This can be frustrating for others because they're trying to support her but she's not accepting it. The author's statement was a way to set a boundary, perhaps to stop the cycle of Joanne's insecurity and the team's discomfort.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author wasn't attacking Joanne's weight; they were pointing out that Joanne's initial comments were seeking input, and when she dismissed it, others might feel it's not worth engaging. The author's response was about setting boundaries, not being judgmental about her weight. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gently. But given that Joanne repeated the behavior with multiple teammates, the author's response seems reasonable. They were protecting the team's dynamics and their own mental space.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're defending against someone else's behavior that's causing discomfort, and their response is a logical consequence to stop the cycle.\n"
