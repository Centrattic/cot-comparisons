Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a college athlete who confronts a teammate, Joanne, for repeatedly making negative comments about her weight and then dismissing others' opinions. The author says they told Joanne to stop talking about her weight around them after she did it three times, which made Joanne offended.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: Joanne is making insecure comments about her body, seeking reassurance but then invalidating others' positive feedback. The author tries to address this by telling Joanne not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. The question is whether this response is appropriate or if the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Intent vs. Impact**: The author's intention was to stop the negative body talk, which might be a valid concern, especially in a team setting where mental health and camaraderie matter. However, the method used could be seen as dismissive or confrontational. \n\n2. **Communication Style**: Telling someone to \"stop talking about it\" might come across as abrupt. The author might have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by discussing it privately or addressing the root cause of Joanne's insecurity. \n\n3. **Context of the Setting**: In a team where body types vary and weight isn't a factor in their sport, the environment should ideally be supportive. The author's action might be seen as trying to maintain a positive environment, which is good. But the way it was delivered could be the issue.\n\n4. **Others' Reactions**: The fact that Joanne was offended suggests that the comment might have been perceived as judgmental or harsh. If the author had a more empathetic approach, maybe that would have been better. \n\n5. **Alternatives Considered**: Instead of a direct confrontation, the author could have discussed it with Joanne privately, explaining how the comments affect others or seeking to support her differently. \n\n6. **Common Situations**: It's common for people, especially young women in sports, to have body image issues. The author might be trying to help, but the approach might need to be more compassionate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the intent was to discourage negative body talk and promote a supportive environment, that's valid. However, the method used might not be the best. The author could be seen as not being in the wrong because they were addressing a problematic behavior, but the way they did it could be improved. Alternatively, if the author's response was too harsh without considering Joanne's feelings, that might make them partially at fault.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable and if there's a better way to handle it. The author's action was a direct response to repeated behavior, so it's a bit of a middle ground. The answer might be \"B\" (not in the wrong) because the intent was good and they were addressing something negative, but the delivery could be better. However, some might argue that they should have handled it differently, making them not fully wrong but not entirely right either. But since the question is a binary choice between A and B, the answer might lean towards B, as the author's intention was to stop harmful behavior, even if the method wasn't perfect.\n"
