      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, and they decided not to let the family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering. The family then threatened not to come if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is considered preterm, but some places might classify it as full term. However, even if it's full term, a three-week early can mean the baby is still a bit fragile. The parents are worried about the flu season and overstimulation. That seems like a valid concern because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems and can get overwhelmed by too many people.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision clearly in a text, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction was to say they won't come if they can't pass the baby. That seems harsh. The parents are trying to protect their child's health and well-being. It's their responsibility to make decisions in the baby's best interest. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation that might make this different? Maybe in some families, not passing the baby might be seen as rude. But the parents are not denying interaction; they're just limiting physical contact for safety. The family's response seems to be taking it personally rather than respecting the parents' decision for the baby's health.\n\nSo, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest, communicated clearly, and the family is overreacting. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
