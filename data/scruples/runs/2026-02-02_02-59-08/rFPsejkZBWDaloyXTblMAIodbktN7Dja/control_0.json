We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is that the family got offended and threatened to exclude them from Christmas if they don't allow the baby to be passed around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. Premature babies, even by a week or two, can have more sensitive immune systems. Flu season is a real concern because even a common flu can lead to complications for infants. The parents are trying to protect their child from potential illness. That seems responsible.\n\nThen, the family's reaction. They were offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas. The parents communicated their decision in a polite way, mentioning not wanting the baby overstimulated and flu concerns. They invited the family over but just not to pass the baby around. So they're not being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries for the baby's well-being.\n\nThe family's response seems a bit harsh. It's possible they misunderstood the parents' intentions, thinking they're being excluded rather than the parents being cautious. Maybe the family felt slighted, but the parents had a valid reason. The key here is whether the parents' actions were justified. Since protecting a newborn's health is a legitimate concern, especially in flu season, the parents are acting in the baby's best interest. The family's reaction of threatening to exclude them seems over the top. \n\nAlso, the parents are not banning the entire visit; they're just limiting physical contact with the baby. The family can still come over and spend time with the child without handling him. That shows they're not being inconsiderate. So the parents are reasonable in their request. Therefore, the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
