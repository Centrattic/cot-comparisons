      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Asker (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's son was born 3 weeks early, at 37 weeks. They decided to let family know they wouldn't be passing the baby around during Christmas, partly because of flu season. The family was offended and said if that's how they felt, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The author's message to the family was polite, explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A or B?).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources might consider it \"early term\" or \"late preterm.\" However, the author says \"barely full term,\" which might be a bit of a stretch since 37 weeks is the earliest full term. But maybe they're using that term because they were worried about the baby's health.\n\nThe main issue is the family not wanting to pass the baby around. This is a common practice in some families, where everyone gets to hold the newborn. The author is setting boundaries for health and safety reasons. Flu season is a real concern, especially for newborns, who have weaker immune systems. Overstimulation is also a valid concern for a newborn's well-being.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because they didn't want the baby passed around is extreme. The author made a reasonable request, explaining their reasons. The family's response was to cut off the author from the holiday, which is a big deal. \n\nIn most cases, setting boundaries for a baby's health is considered responsible. Unless there's a cultural or family norm that's being violated without explanation, the author's stance is justified. The fact that the author invited the family over to meet the baby but set limits shows they're not being completely closed off. The family's reaction seems disproportionate to the request. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author was inconsiderate beyond explaining their reasons. The family might have felt slighted, but the author's main concern was the baby's health. The answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they had legitimate reasons and communicated them clearly.\n"
