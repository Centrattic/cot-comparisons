You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not letting their family hold or pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas if they didn't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born three weeks early, which is considered a full term (37 weeks is the start of full term, but some sources say 39 weeks is full, so maybe there's a nuance here). The parents wanted to protect the baby from overstimulation and the flu, which is a common concern, especially in flu season. They communicated this politely in a text message.\n\nThe parents' message was clear: they don't want to pass the baby around but are open to the family visiting. The family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas if the parents don't comply. That seems pretty harsh. The parents are trying to prioritize their baby's health and well-being. \n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is it reasonable for the parents to set boundaries about handling a newborn, especially when there's a health concern? Most medical guidelines suggest that handling a newborn should be done carefully, especially if the baby is premature. Overstimulation and exposure to germs are valid worries. \n\nThe family's reaction seems excessive. Threatening to exclude someone from a family event over a baby's health precautions is not typical. Parents should have the right to decide how their child is treated. The parents didn't say no to interaction entirely; they just set boundaries. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the author is not in the wrong. They are acting in their child's best interest. The family overreacted. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
