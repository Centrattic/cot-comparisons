We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the newborn was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is considered preterm. The parents decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a family gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense, and now there's a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parents' decision is reasonable. Premature babies, even those born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to infections and might need a bit more care. The flu season is a valid concern because flu can be severe for infants. Also, overstimulation from too many people handling the baby is a common precaution for newborns, especially those born early.\n\nThe parents did inform the family in advance and made it clear that they were welcome to visit and interact, just not to pass the baby around. The message seems polite and considerate, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they didn't take the parents' concerns seriously. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they expressed their needs and boundaries upfront. It's important for new parents to set limits to protect their baby's health. The family might feel excluded, but the parents have a right to prioritize their child's well-being. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
