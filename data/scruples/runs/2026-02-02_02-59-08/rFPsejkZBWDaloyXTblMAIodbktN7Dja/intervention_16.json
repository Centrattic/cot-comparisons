We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early term but not extremely preterm. They wanted to avoid passing the baby around during flu season to keep him safe, which led to family being upset and even threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A 37-week baby is considered full-term in some definitions, but technically, full term is 39 weeks. However, 37 weeks is still considered late preterm. These babies can sometimes have more health risks than those born at 39 weeks, like respiratory issues or difficulty regulating temperature. So the parents might be justified in taking precautions, especially during flu season when infections can be more dangerous for infants.\n\nThe parents' message says they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. They invited the family over, so the intention wasn't to exclude them but to limit physical contact. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they felt like they were being excluded from a family event. The key here is communication. The parents did inform them in advance, which is good, but the way it was received might have been sensitive.\n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong. They're making a decision based on their baby's health, which is a valid concern. The family's response seems over-the-top. The parents didn't refuse visitors; they just set a boundary about handling the baby. It's important to prioritize the baby's well-being, especially during flu season. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
