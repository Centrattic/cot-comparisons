      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn son who was born at 37 weeks. The family is upset and took offense, leading to a Christmas invitation being rescinded. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born three weeks early but at exactly 37 weeks. The parents wanted to be cautious due to flu season and informed the family they wouldn't pass the baby around. The family felt offended. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the health and safety of the newborn. Premature babies, even borderline, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months. So, parents taking precautions to avoid exposing the baby to germs is understandable.\n\nHowever, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents didn't say no to the visit entirely; they just didn't want the baby passed around. They invited the family to hang out. The family's response was to exclude them from Christmas, which seems extreme. \n\nThe parents communicated their request politely, explaining their reasons. Over-stimulation is also a valid concern for newborns. So, their reasoning is logical and health-focused. On the other hand, the family might have felt slighted, maybe interpreting it as the baby not being a good enough reason or a personal rejection. \n\nBut from a health perspective, protecting the baby is the priority. The parents made their intentions clear and still allowed the visit. The family's reaction seems more about taking offense than about the baby's well-being. \n\nSo, in this case, the parents are not in the wrong. They're taking reasonable precautions for their child's health. The family's response was disproportionate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
