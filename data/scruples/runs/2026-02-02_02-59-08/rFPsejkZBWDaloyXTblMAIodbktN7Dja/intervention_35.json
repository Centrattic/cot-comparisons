We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They decided not to let their family hold or pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering, mainly because of flu season and wanting to avoid overstimulating the baby. The family took offense, and now there's a rift because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A 37-week baby is considered \"barely full term,\" which I think is a bit of a technical term. In reality, full term is usually considered 39-40 weeks, so 37 weeks is considered early term. These babies might still be a bit more fragile compared to full-term infants. So, the parents might have valid concerns about infections, especially during flu season. Newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months, so they are more vulnerable. Also, overstimulation could be a concern for such a young baby, who needs a lot of rest and a calm environment.\n\nHowever, the parents' message was about not passing the baby around. The key here is how they communicated it. The message they sent was polite, mentioning the reasons: over-stimulation and flu concerns. They also invited the family to come over and hang out with the baby. So, the message seems considerate and clear. \n\nThe problem arises when the family took offense. Maybe the family felt excluded or thought the parents were being unnecessarily cautious. But is the parents' action reasonable? On one hand, the parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being, which is a parent's primary responsibility. On the other hand, the family might have felt that this decision was a slight or a rejection of their family traditions. \n\nThe question is whether the parents were wrong in making that decision. From a medical standpoint, their precautions make sense. Newborns, especially those born early, are more susceptible to infections. The flu can be severe in infants, leading to complications. So, avoiding close contact with many people, especially during flu season, is a common recommendation by pediatricians. Overstimulation is also a valid concern; newborns need a lot of quiet time to adjust to the world.\n\nBut the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling the parents to not come to Christmas if they feel that way is extreme. The parents were trying to be cautious, not to exclude the family. The parents didn't say the family couldn't come over; they just didn't want the baby passed around. The family might have misinterpreted the message as a rejection rather than a health precaution. However, the parents made their reasons clear, so the family should have understood. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the parents acted out of genuine concern for the baby's health and communicated it clearly, then they are not in the wrong. The family's reaction is what's problematic here. The parents are within their rights to set boundaries to protect their newborn. So, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
