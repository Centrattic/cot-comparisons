      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents decided not to let the family pass around the baby during a family gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family reacted negatively, leading to a Christmas gathering being threatened.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the reasons given by the parents. 37 weeks is considered full term by some definitions, but it's still considered early by others. The parents are worried about the flu, which is a valid concern, especially for a newborn. They also mention not wanting the baby overstimulated, which is common advice for new parents to protect their baby's health and well-being.\n\nThe family's reaction is that they feel offended. But is the parents' decision reasonable? The parents are making a health decision for their child. They're not entirely cutting off interaction; they're allowing the family to come over and hang out. The issue seems to be about passing the baby around, which could expose him to germs or stress him out. \n\nI should consider if there's any cultural or social expectation that requires passing around the baby at family gatherings. In some cultures, sharing the baby is a way to celebrate, but the parents have a legitimate health reason to refuse. They also communicated their decision in advance, so the family had time to prepare. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' responsibility to protect their child's health, their communication of the decision, and the family's overreaction. The parents didn't say not to come over, just not to pass the baby around. The family's response of threatening not to come to Christmas seems excessive. \n\nTherefore, the parents are not in the wrong. They're making a reasonable decision based on health concerns and have communicated it clearly. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
