We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family then threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically considered full-term, but it's still early. However, the parents mentioned it's flu season, so they might be concerned about the baby's health. Even if the baby is healthy, preventing exposure to illnesses is a common precaution for newborns, especially in the first few months. So, from a health and safety perspective, the parents have a valid reason.\n\nNext, the way the parents communicated their decision. They sent a message saying they're not passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. It's polite and they invited the family over to hang out. But maybe the family took offense because they felt excluded or not trusted to handle the baby. Cultural or family expectations might play a role here. Some families might take it personally if they can't hold the baby, especially during a holiday gathering.\n\nThe key points are: the baby's health is a priority, the parents' communication was clear and polite, and the family's reaction seems extreme. The parents are making a reasonable decision to protect their child, which is a common parental instinct. The family's threat to not attend Christmas if the baby isn't passed around seems harsh. It's possible the family didn't consider the health aspects or felt that the refusal was a personal slight rather than a medical necessity.\n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason based on health concerns and the right to make decisions about their child's safety. The family overreacted. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
