We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole (AITA) for not letting their family hold their newborn son, who was born 37 weeks early. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to not have them come to Christmas if they refused to pass the baby around. The user sent a message explaining their reasons were about safety due to flu season and not overstimulating the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources might say that 37 weeks is technically early and the baby could need more care. However, the user says \"barely full term,\" which might imply it's close enough. But regardless, flu season is a valid concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine and are at higher risk for complications. So the decision to protect the baby is medically sound.\n\nNext, the family's reaction. The user's message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family took it as an offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas. That's a strong reaction. The user is trying to balance family traditions with the baby's health. The family's response seems to prioritize their own feelings over the baby's safety. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? They're making a responsible choice for their child's health. The family's threat to exclude them seems unreasonable. The user's message was clear and respectful, so they're not being inconsiderate. The family's overreaction is more the issue here. \n\nSo the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're acting in the baby's best interest, and the family's reaction is disproportionate.\n"
