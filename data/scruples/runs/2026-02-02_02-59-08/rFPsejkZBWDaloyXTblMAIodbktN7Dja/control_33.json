We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term for medical purposes (since full term is 37-40 weeks). However, people sometimes still refer to 37 weeks as \"early\" because it's a few weeks before the typical 40 weeks.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is about safety due to flu season and not wanting the baby over-stimulated. They communicated their decision clearly in a text message, which the family took as an offense. The family's reaction was strong enough to threaten canceling Christmas. \n\nNow, from a medical standpoint, a 37-week baby is generally considered full term, so the risk of complications is lower compared to earlier preemies. However, parents might still have concerns, especially during flu season. The parents are not being overly cautious; they're taking precautions which are reasonable. \n\nThe key issue here is the family's reaction. The parents set boundaries for their baby's well-being, which is their right. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems excessive. It's possible that there's some misunderstanding or sensitivity around the term \"barely full term,\" but the parents are justified in their decision to protect the baby.\n\nSo, the parents aren't wrong for setting these limits. The family's reaction is the problem, not the parents' decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
