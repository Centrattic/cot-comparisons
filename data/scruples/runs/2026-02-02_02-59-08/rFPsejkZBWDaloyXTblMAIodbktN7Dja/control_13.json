We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but just barely. The parents sent a message saying they wouldn't be passing the baby around during Christmas because they wanted to be safe due to flu season. The family took offense, leading to a threat to exclude them from Christmas if they don't hold the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parents are setting a boundary to protect their newborn's health. 37 weeks is technically full term, but the baby might still be a bit more fragile than a full-term baby (which is typically 39-40 weeks). Flu season is a real concern, as newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months old, so they're vulnerable. The parents are probably trying to avoid exposing the baby to potential germs.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Saying they won't come to Christmas if the baby isn't passed around is overreacting. The parents' request is reasonable, especially considering health and safety. The message they sent was polite and explained their reasons. They're not refusing visitors but just not passing the baby around. It's a common concern with new parents to limit handling by many people, especially in the first few months.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health perspective, their decision makes sense. They have the right to set boundaries. The family's response seems to take it as a personal slight rather than respecting the parents' wishes. The parents are being responsible, not inconsiderate. The answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. The family is overreacting, and the parents are justified in their decision.\n"
