      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author had a newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They wanted to be safe because it's flu season, so they told their family they wouldn't be passing the baby around. The family reacted really negatively, even saying something about not coming to Christmas if that's how they feel. The author's message was supposed to be a heads-up, explaining their decision to keep the baby from being overstimulated and to avoid flu risks. Now they're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term by some definitions, but others might consider 37 weeks as early. Wait, full-term is typically considered 39 weeks or later. 37-38 weeks is considered \"early term.\" So maybe the baby is at a higher risk for complications compared to a full-term baby. So the parents' concern about flu season is valid because a preterm baby might have a weaker immune system or underdeveloped organs, making them more susceptible to illnesses. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents made a decision they thought was in the baby's best interest, but the family took offense. The parents' message was polite and explained their reasons, but maybe the family didn't take it well. The family's reaction seems extreme\u2014they're threatening to exclude the parents from Christmas if they don't pass the baby around. That seems harsh. The parents didn't say the family couldn't visit at all; they just couldn't pass the baby around. The family might have misunderstood, thinking they're not allowed to see the baby at all. Or maybe the family feels slighted because they expected to hold the baby, which is a common tradition.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a health perspective, the parents are trying to protect their newborn. From a social standpoint, they communicated their decision in advance and gave an explanation. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're making a medical decision. The family's response is more about their feelings being hurt than the author being wrong. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural norm I'm missing. In some cultures, not allowing immediate family to hold the baby might be seen as rude. However, the parents did allow them to come over and hang out with the baby, just not pass him around. So maybe the family didn't read the message correctly. The parents' actions were reasonable, and the family overreacted. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
