We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but some people might still consider it \"barely\" full term. The family told them not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nThe author's text mentions concerns about flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. So, their reasons are health and comfort. The family took offense, leading to the Christmas threat. \n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is wrong. On one hand, it's about protecting a newborn, especially in flu season. New parents might have valid medical concerns. On the other, maybe the family felt excluded or disrespected. However, the author did offer an alternative: coming over to hang out. So it's not a complete refusal. \n\nIs 37 weeks really a problem? Medically, a 37-week baby is full term, but some might still be cautious. The flu season is a real concern. The author's message seems polite, explaining their reasons. So, maybe the family overreacted. \n\nIf the author had a doctor's advice, that would strengthen their case. But even without, parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. The family's response seems harsh. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
