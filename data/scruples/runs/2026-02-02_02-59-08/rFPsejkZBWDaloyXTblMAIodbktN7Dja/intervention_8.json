      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that their son was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, and they decided not to let family pass around the newborn during Christmas. The family was offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered \"barely full term.\" Full term is usually 39 weeks, so 37 is still early. But 37 weeks is close enough that maybe the parents were just being cautious. They mentioned flu season as a reason, so they probably wanted to avoid exposing the baby to illness. \n\nThe parents texted the family in advance, explaining they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. The family took this as an offense and reacted strongly, leading the parents to question if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the parents' decision not to pass the baby around is considered rude or inconsiderate. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health and well-being, which is a common concern, especially with premature or young infants. However, the family's reaction seems harsh. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some families, not allowing baby to be held by relatives is seen as untrustworthy or not appreciating their desire to bond. But the parents did give a heads-up and invited everyone to hang out. Maybe the family felt excluded or taken for granted. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are making a responsible choice for their baby's safety. Flu season can be dangerous for newborns, and overstimulation is a real issue. The message seems polite and clear, giving a reason and an alternative. \n\nIs there a way the parents could have handled it better? Maybe by being more specific about the baby's condition or reassuring the family that they're still welcome. But the message they sent seems reasonable. \n\nThe family's response of threatening to exclude them from Christmas seems disproportionate. The parents didn't say they don't want visitors, just that they won't pass the baby. It's possible the family took it as a rejection, but the parents' intent was to protect the baby. \n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong. They communicated their decision, provided a reason, and still wanted the family to be present. The family's reaction is more extreme. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
