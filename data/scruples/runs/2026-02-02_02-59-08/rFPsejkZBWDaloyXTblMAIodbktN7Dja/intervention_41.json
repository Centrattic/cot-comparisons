The user is asking whether the person who sent the message\u4e0d\u8ba9\u5bb6\u4eba\u4f20\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65e9\u4ea7\u513f\u662f\u9519\u7684\u3002The situation is that their son was born 3 weeks early at 37 weeks, and they decided not to let family pass around the baby during a family gathering. They mentioned it's flu season and they want to protect the baby from overstimulation and flu. The family got offended and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the context. 37 weeks is considered full term in some definitions, but others might say it's late preterm. Anyway, the parents are concerned about flu season and overstimulation. They wanted to protect the baby, so they sent a message in advance. But the family took it as a slight and responded with a harsh statement about Christmas.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider the parents' perspective. They have a legitimate reason to be cautious. A newborn's immune system is not fully developed, so flu season is a valid concern. Also, overstimulation can affect a baby's health. They communicated their decision in advance, which is polite. They also invited the family to come over and meet the baby, just not to pass the baby around. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel excluded or offended because the message was interpreted as a rejection. Maybe they felt it was dismissive or that the parents were prioritizing their own comfort over family traditions. However, the parents' priority is the baby's health and well-being, which is natural. The family's response seems a bit extreme, holding a grudge over a health precaution.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents acted unreasonably. Since they gave a valid reason and communicated clearly, it's not their fault. The family's reaction is more about taking it personally rather than understanding the health concerns. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
