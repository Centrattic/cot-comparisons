You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let family pass around the newborn during Christmas. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is technically full term, but it's still early and the baby might be more vulnerable. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation. That seems reasonable. Parents often have these concerns to protect their newborn's health. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The family was apparently expecting to hold the baby, and when they were told they couldn't, they felt offended. But the parents did invite them over to hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. \n\nIs it the parents' fault for setting boundaries? I don't think so. The family might have had different expectations, but the parents have the right to protect their child's health. It's their decision to limit contact if they're worried about germs or the baby's well-being. \n\nThe family's reaction of threatening to exclude them from Christmas because of this seems excessive. Family gatherings can be stressful, and while some might feel hurt, the parents' actions are in the baby's best interest. The parents clearly communicated their wishes in advance, so it's not like it was a last-minute snub. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a responsible decision for their baby's health and communicated it properly. The family overreacted.\n"
