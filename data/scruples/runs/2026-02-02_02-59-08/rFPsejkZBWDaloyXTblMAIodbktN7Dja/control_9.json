      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They mentioned it's flu season and they wanted to protect the baby, so they informed the family in advance. But this caused offense, and the family even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks are considered \"early term.\" However, most hospitals consider 37 weeks as full term. Still, some parents might be cautious with a slightly early baby, especially in flu season. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and reduce the risk of illness.\n\nThe parents sent a message in advance explaining their decision. The family was offended, leading to a potential conflict over Christmas plans. The user is asking if they are the asshole here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think. The parents are trying to protect their newborn. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, and even with a full-term birth, it's common to be cautious. Flu season is a real concern. They didn't say no visitors, just that they wouldn't pass the baby around. They invited the family to come over and hang out, which suggests they still wanted interaction, just without passing the baby.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas because of this seems like an overreaction. The parents made their decision known in advance and were clear about their reasons. There's no indication they were rude or dismissive. They were polite and gave a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the family has a right to be upset if they felt excluded or if they think the parents are being overly controlling. But given the context of health concerns, especially for a slightly early baby, the parents' decision seems reasonable. The line between being cautious and being difficult is thin, but the parents did communicate their reasons upfront.\n\nAlso, the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is full term in many definitions, but maybe in their community or family, there's a different perspective. However, the parents' main points are about overstimulation and flu risk, which are legitimate concerns. The family's response seems disproportionate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They had a valid reason, communicated it politely, and the family's reaction seems excessive.\n"
