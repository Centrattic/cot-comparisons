We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family was upset and threatened not to come to Christmas if they don't allow it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born three weeks early, which is considered a full term, but maybe still a bit early. The parents wanted to keep the baby safe during flu season, so they decided against passing him around. Their message was polite, explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family took offense and reacted strongly.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents have a valid concern. Newborns, even if born at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real risk. The parents are making a decision to protect their baby's health, which is a common-sense precaution. They're also setting boundaries for the baby's well-being, which is their right as parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems a bit extreme. Threatening to not come to Christmas because the baby isn't being passed around might indicate a lack of understanding of the health risks. The parents were clear and polite in their message, so there's no indication they were rude or dismissive. They even invited the family to visit, showing they still wanted to celebrate together.\n\nSo, considering the health of the newborn and the parents' right to make medical decisions for their child, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
