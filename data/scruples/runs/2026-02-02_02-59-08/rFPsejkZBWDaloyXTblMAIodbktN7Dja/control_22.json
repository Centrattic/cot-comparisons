We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The family is upset and even mentions not coming to Christmas if they don't get to hold the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the newborn. 37 weeks is considered early, and the baby might still be vulnerable, especially during flu season. The parents are concerned about over-stimulation and germs, which are valid medical reasons. Doctors often advise limiting visitors and handling for preemies because their immune systems are weaker and they can get sick more easily.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. They feel offended and are threatening to not attend Christmas. That's a big deal. The parents tried to communicate their request politely, mentioning the flu season and wanting to protect the baby. It seems like they're trying to balance family time with the baby's health.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to make medical decisions for their child versus family expectations. The parents are not being unreasonable in their request; they have a legitimate health concern. The family's reaction is more about feeling excluded rather than the baby's well-being. However, it's important to note that family gatherings are important socially, so there's a balance to strike.\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some cultures, holding the newborn is a big deal, and not allowing it might be seen as a slight. But in others, health and safety take precedence. The parents might not have considered the emotional impact on the family, but their primary duty is to protect the baby.\n\nIn the text message, the parents are clear about their reasons and invite the family to come over. They didn't completely ban visitors, just didn't want the baby passed around. The family's threat to exclude each other over a baby's health seems harsh.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are justified in their request to protect the baby's health. The family's reaction is over the top and not based on the actual reasons given. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
