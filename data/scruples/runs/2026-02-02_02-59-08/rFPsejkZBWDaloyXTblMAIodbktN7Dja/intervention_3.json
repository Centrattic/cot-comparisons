We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is early but still considered full term by some definitions. The author sent a text explaining they don't want to over-stimulate the baby and are worried about flu season, which led to family being upset and threatening to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources might consider it early term. However, the parents might still be cautious because even a week early can mean the baby is more vulnerable. The flu season is a valid concern, as pregnant women and newborns are at higher risk for complications. So the parents' reasoning for not passing the baby around is based on health and safety.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author's message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and meet the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014they're threatening to skip Christmas. That's a strong response. It's possible the family felt excluded or that their cultural norms were being ignored. In some cultures, holding the newborn is a big deal, especially for grandparents or other relatives.\n\nBut the parents are the ones responsible for the baby's health. They have the right to make decisions to protect their child. The key here is whether the parents' decision was unreasonable. They didn't prevent the family from seeing the baby entirely, just not passing him around. The message seems reasonable and considerate, even if the family took offense.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but upon analysis, it seems the parents are doing what's best for their child. The family's reaction is disproportionate. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong). The parents are justified in their caution, and the family needs to understand the health risks.\n"
