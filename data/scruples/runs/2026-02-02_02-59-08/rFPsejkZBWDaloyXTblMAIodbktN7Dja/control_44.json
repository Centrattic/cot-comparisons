You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author's son was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They wanted to keep the baby safe during flu season and decided not to let family members pass around the newborn during a Christmas gathering. They sent a message explaining their decision, but the family reacted negatively, even threatening to not come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A newborn, especially a preterm baby, is more vulnerable to infections. Flu season is a real concern. The parents want to protect their child's health, so they set boundaries. Their message was polite and explained the reasons, which is reasonable. They're not refusing visitors entirely but are setting a limit on handling the baby to prevent overstimulation and reduce health risks.\n\nOn the other side, the family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not attend a family event because the parents want to protect their newborn seems overly punitive. It's understandable that family members might be disappointed they can't hold the baby, but their response is extreme. Maybe there's some misunderstanding or hurt feelings, but the parents are justified in their precautions.\n\nI should also think about cultural or social norms. In many cultures, family gatherings with newborns are common, but health comes first. The parents have the right to make decisions based on their baby's needs. The family's reaction might stem from not fully understanding the medical risks or feeling slighted, but that doesn't make the parents wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the parents communicated their decision in advance, showing consideration. They invited the family over, just with a specific request. The family's response of cutting off the Christmas gathering is disproportionate. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being protective. The real issue might be the family's inability to accept the parents' boundaries without taking it personally.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are not in the wrong. Their actions are reasonable and necessary for the baby's health. The family's reaction is the problem here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
