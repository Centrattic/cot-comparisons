We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, which means it's a preterm birth, but at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term by some definitions. Wait, actually, full-term is typically 37-40 weeks, right? So 37 weeks is considered early term, but still within the range of full term. So maybe the baby is considered full-term, but the parents are being cautious because of flu season.\n\nThe parents sent a message saying they don't want to pass the baby around, to avoid overstimulation and flu transmission. Then the family took offense and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical advice. New parents, especially with a preterm or early-term baby, are often advised to limit visitors and avoid overstimulation. Flu season is a real concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, so they're vulnerable. So from a health perspective, the parents are making a responsible decision.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. They might feel excluded or not respected. Maybe they wanted to see the baby and felt it's a family event. But the parents are setting boundaries for the baby's well-being. The text message the parents sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They allowed family to come over and hang out with the baby, just not pass him around. That seems reasonable. \n\nThe family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems harsh. It's possible they were hurt or felt slighted, but the parents' priority is the baby's health. In that case, the parents are not the asshole because they're protecting their child. The family overreacted. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
