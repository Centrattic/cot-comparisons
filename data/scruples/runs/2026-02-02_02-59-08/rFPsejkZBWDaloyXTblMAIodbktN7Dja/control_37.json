We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation seems to be about a family conflict over a baby's care during a holiday visit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but slightly early. However, some sources say that 37 weeks is considered early term, and these babies might still need more care. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation, which are valid reasons. Premature babies can be more vulnerable to infections, so limiting exposure might be necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the family reaction was harsh, cutting off the Christmas plans. The parents' message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to visit but set boundaries about not passing the baby around. The family's response seems to take it personally, which might indicate their own issues with boundaries or lack of understanding about the baby's needs.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The parents are acting in the baby's best interest. 2) They communicated their decision respectfully. 3) The family overreacted, possibly due to not understanding the medical concerns or feeling slighted. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the parents made a reasonable request for the baby's health and safety, and the family reacted inconsiderately, then the author isn't at fault. The parents have the right to make decisions about their child's care, even if it disappoints others. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
