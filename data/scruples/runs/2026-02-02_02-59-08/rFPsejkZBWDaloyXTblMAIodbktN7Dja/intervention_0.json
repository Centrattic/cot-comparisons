We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their newborn was born 37 weeks (which is actually full term, but some sources say 37-38 weeks is early term), and they decided not to let family pass around the baby during Christmas because of flu season and avoiding overstimulation. The family got upset, and now there's a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is considered early term, but it's still a full-term baby by some definitions. However, even if it's full term, newborns can be more vulnerable to illnesses like the flu. The parents are trying to protect their baby, which is a common concern. \n\nThe parents' message is polite, explaining their reasons. They're not refusing visitors but are setting boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas is a big consequence. \n\nOn the other hand, family traditions might involve holding the baby, and the parents' refusal could be seen as a rejection. But the parents have a legitimate health concern. \n\nI think the parents are in the right here. It's their baby, and they have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. The family overreacted. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
