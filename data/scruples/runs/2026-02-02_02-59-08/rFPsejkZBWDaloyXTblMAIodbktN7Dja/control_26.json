      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not allowing family to pass around their newborn, which was born 37 weeks early. The family reacted by threatening to not come to Christmas if they don't get to hold the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is still considered full-term, as full-term is generally 37-42 weeks. However, the parents mention it's flu season, so their concern about the baby's health is valid. Premature infants, even by a few weeks, can be more susceptible to illnesses, so avoiding exposure might be a precautionary measure.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision clearly and offered an alternative\u2014letting the family come over to interact with the baby in a way that's comfortable for them. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially threatening to exclude them from Christmas gatherings. That seems like an overreaction, given the parents' explanation is reasonable and they're not completely banning visitors, just limiting close contact like passing around.\n\nAlso, the parents are setting boundaries to protect their child's health, which is a common practice. It's not uncommon for new parents to have specific needs during the early weeks. The family's response might come from not understanding the medical reasoning or feeling slighted, but the parents aren't at fault for prioritizing their baby's well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are justifiably cautious, communicated their needs, and the family's threat is an overreaction. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
