      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). The family members got upset and threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, right? Wait, actually, full-term is 37 weeks to 42 weeks. So, 37 weeks is technically full-term, but it's still considered early. However, some sources say that the first few weeks are crucial for the baby's development. Even though the baby is full-term, they might still be more vulnerable to infections like the flu. So the parents' concern about the flu season is valid. \n\nThe parents sent a message explaining they don't want the baby over-stimulated and are worried about the flu. They invite the family to come over and hang out but not to pass the baby around. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The parents are prioritizing their baby's health and well-being. They're being cautious, which is understandable, especially during flu season. The family seems to have taken it as a personal slight rather than a health precaution. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or family expectation here. In some families, not allowing everyone to hold the baby might be seen as a sign of distrust or not being open. However, the parents have a legitimate reason. The family's reaction is harsh\u2014threatening to exclude them from Christmas over this. \n\nFrom a health perspective, the parents are making a responsible decision. The baby is only three weeks old, and even if full-term, they're still at higher risk for infections. The flu can be severe in infants. Over-stimulation is also a valid concern for newborns. \n\nThe parents communicated their decision in advance, so the family wasn't caught off guard. The family's response seems to be more about feeling excluded or not respected rather than a genuine concern about the baby's health. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are not in the wrong. They have a valid reason based on health and the baby's needs. The family overreacted. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not the asshole.\n"
