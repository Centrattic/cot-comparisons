We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let their family pass around the newborn during Christmas. They sent a message explaining their reasons\u2014overstimulation and flu season. The family got offended and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is still preterm, so there might be health concerns. Flu season is a real issue, and newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months old. So their reasons for being cautious make sense medically. They're trying to protect the baby from infections and sensory overload, which are valid concerns for a preterm infant.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel excluded or not trusted. Maybe they take the refusal personally, thinking the parents are prioritizing the baby over family traditions. But the parents clearly communicated their reasons, and they invited the family to visit, just not to pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh because the parents are setting a boundary for health reasons, not out of a desire to exclude them.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some families might expect to hold the baby, but the parents are within their rights to set limits. The key here is that the parents made their decision known in advance and provided a rationale. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems excessive given the circumstances. The parents are acting in the baby's best interest, which should be respected.\n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. The family's overreaction is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
