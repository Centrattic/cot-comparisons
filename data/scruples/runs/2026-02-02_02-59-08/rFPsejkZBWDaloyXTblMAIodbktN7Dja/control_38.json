We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation arose during Christmas, and the family reacted strongly by suggesting they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspect. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but some sources might say that 37 weeks is technically early. However, the main concern here is flu season. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, making them more susceptible to illnesses. So, the parents' decision to limit handling of the baby to prevent exposure to germs is medically sound. \n\nNext, the family's reaction. They felt offended and used the threat of excluding them from Christmas. That's a strong response. The parents' message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons for not passing the baby around. They didn't say no visitors, just no passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and germs. The family might be used to a certain tradition or not understanding the health risks, leading to their upset. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus family traditions. The parents communicated their decision in advance, showing consideration. The family's response seems disproportionate. While family gatherings can be important, the health of a newborn is critical. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're making a responsible choice. \n\nSo, putting this together, the parents aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
