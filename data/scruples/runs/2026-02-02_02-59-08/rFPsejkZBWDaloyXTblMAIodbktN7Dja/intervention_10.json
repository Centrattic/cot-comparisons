You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family is upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if they don't get to hold the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but being three weeks early might still mean the baby is a bit more fragile compared to a full-term baby. The parents are concerned about flu season. I remember that flu can be serious for newborns, and their immune systems are still developing. So from a health perspective, the parents' decision to limit contact might be reasonable.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The user's message was polite, explaining their reasons and inviting the family to visit. They said they didn't want the baby overstimulated. The family took offense and used the Christmas threat. That seems harsh. Families often have different customs and expectations. Maybe the family expected to hold the baby, and when they weren't allowed, they felt rejected. But is that a valid reaction?\n\nThe parents are trying to protect their child's health. The flu is a legitimate concern, especially for a preterm infant. Overstimulation can also be an issue for newborns. The message from the parents was clear and respectful, giving a reason and still allowing the family to visit. So the parents aren't being rude, just cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family didn't realize that 37 weeks is considered full-term, so they might have thought the baby was significantly premature. But the parents did mention \"barely full term,\" so they acknowledged it's not extremely early. The family's reaction could stem from not understanding the medical reasoning or feeling excluded.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for new parents to set boundaries with their newborns, especially if there are health considerations. Expecting family to respect those boundaries is reasonable. The family overreacted by threatening to not come to Christmas, which is a serious consequence. That suggests they didn't take the parents' health concerns seriously and prioritized their own desire to hold the baby over the parents' decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are trying to protect their child's health and well-being. Their communication was polite and clear. The family's reaction is disproportionate and dismissive of the parents' valid concerns. Therefore, the parents are not in the wrong here.\n"
