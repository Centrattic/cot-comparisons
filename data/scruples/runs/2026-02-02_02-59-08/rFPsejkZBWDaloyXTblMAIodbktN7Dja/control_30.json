      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation is that the family got offended and even threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks. While that's considered full term in some definitions, others might consider it \"barely full term\" or slightly premature. The parents are worried about flu season and not overstimulating the baby. They sent a message explaining this, but the family took it as an offense.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parents are in the wrong. Let's break it down. Parents have a responsibility to protect their child's health. If the baby is born early, even by a week or two, they might have a weaker immune system, making them more susceptible to illnesses like the flu. Also, overstimulation from too many people handling the baby could be a valid concern for the parents, especially in the early weeks.\n\nHowever, the family's reaction seems extreme. Telling them not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around is a harsh response. The parents were clear and polite in their message, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to hang out, just not to pass the baby. That should be reasonable. Families can have different views on handling newborns, but cutting off a holiday gathering because of health precautions seems disproportionate.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family had different cultural or traditional expectations where not passing the baby is seen as disrespectful or rejecting their well-wishes. But health concerns are legitimate, and the parents have the right to make decisions based on their child's needs. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or not taking the health reasons seriously.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are not in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision for their baby's health and safety. The family overreacted. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
