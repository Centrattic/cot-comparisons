We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is technically full term, but barely. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to avoid passing the baby around to prevent overstimulation and potential illness. The family reacted strongly, saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources say that 39 weeks is ideal for optimal development. However, 37 weeks is still within the full-term range. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation. From a health perspective, reducing exposure to germs is a common precaution for newborns, even if the baby is full-term. So their concerns might be valid.\n\nThen, the social aspect. The family felt offended and took it as a personal slight. The parents communicated their decision in a polite way, mentioning flu and overstimulation. But the family took it to the point of threatening to exclude them from Christmas. That seems harsh. Is it reasonable to expect that a family would understand health precautions for a newborn, especially during flu season?\n\nThe parents didn't say no to the family coming over; they just don't want the baby passed around. They are still inviting them to hang out with the baby. The family's reaction seems over the top. The parents are making a health-conscious decision, which they have the right to do for their child. It's their choice how to manage their baby's care.\n\nSo, the author probably isn't in the wrong. They communicated their wishes clearly and respectfully, and the family's reaction is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
