We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, and it's flu season. They sent a message saying they don't want to pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family took offense and said if that's the case, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. 37 weeks is considered full term, but still technically early. However, the parents are concerned about the flu season. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, can be more vulnerable to illnesses. The parents are trying to protect their baby's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the family is upset because they wanted to hold the baby. There could be a cultural or personal expectation about handling newborns during family gatherings. But is the parent's decision reasonable?\n\nThe parents did give a clear reason for their decision, which is health and safety. They also invited the family to come over and interact, just not to pass the baby around. However, the message might have been perceived as a rejection or not valuing the family's desire to see the baby. Maybe the wording could have been more considerate, but the intent was to protect the baby.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas over this seems excessive. But does that mean the parents are in the wrong? Probably not. They have a valid health concern. The parents are making a reasonable choice for their child's safety. The family's reaction is more about feeling slighted than the parents being wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
