      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is just a bit before full term. The parents wanted to be safe because it's flu season, so they told the family in advance that they wouldn't pass the baby around. But this led to the family being offended and even saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 37-week pregnancy is considered full term by some definitions, but others might consider it late preterm. However, the key here is that the parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation. New parents often have strict rules for the baby's safety, especially when there's a health concern like a preterm birth. \n\nThe parents sent a message to their family in advance, explaining their reasons. They allowed the family to come over and meet the baby but under controlled conditions. The family reacted negatively, leading to a potential holiday conflict. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nFrom a health perspective, protecting a newborn from exposure to illness is reasonable. Even if the baby was born at 37 weeks, they might still be more vulnerable. Flu season is a valid concern because young infants can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, and they're more susceptible to severe complications. \n\nAlso, overstimulation is a common reason new parents avoid too many people around their newborns, especially in the first few weeks. It's about creating a calm environment for the baby. The parents didn't say they wouldn't allow the family to meet the baby; they just didn't want to pass the baby around. That's a reasonable boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. If they had known in advance, they might have adjusted their plans. The parents did communicate their decision politely, so it's not like they were rude or abrupt. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably or without justification. Here, the parents had valid health concerns and communicated their decision upfront. Their actions are protective and reasonable. The family's reaction is more about feeling excluded or disrespected, but the parents' priority is the baby's well-being. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are justified in setting boundaries for their baby's health and safety, especially when they've communicated this clearly. The family's overreaction is the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
