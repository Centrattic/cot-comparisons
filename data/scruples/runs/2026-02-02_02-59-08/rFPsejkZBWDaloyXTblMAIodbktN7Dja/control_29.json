We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but technically still full-term, depending on definitions. They mentioned flu season as a reason, and they wanted to avoid over-stimulation.\n\nThe family reacted strongly, saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The author's message was polite and offered an alternative (inviting everyone to come over and hang out). So, the author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the typical norms around newborns. Usually, people do want to hold and see their new grandchild or family member. But when a baby is born early, even if it's just a few weeks, there might be health considerations. The parents might be more cautious. Flu season adds a layer because of the baby's vulnerability to illnesses.\n\nThe author's message was clear and polite. They explained the reasoning (flu season and over-stimulation) and invited the family to visit. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to exclude them from Christmas over this seems extreme. But maybe the family felt snubbed or thought the parents were being overly cautious.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have a valid reason to protect their baby's health. The family's response is more about their feelings being hurt rather than the author doing something objectively wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision based on medical advice (flu season, early term) and communicated it politely. The family's reaction is disproportionate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
