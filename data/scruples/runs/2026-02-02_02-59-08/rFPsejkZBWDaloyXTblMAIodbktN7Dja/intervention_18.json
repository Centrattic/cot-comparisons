We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, which was born three weeks early. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is technically full-term. The medical definition of full-term is between 37 and 40 weeks, so the baby isn't considered premature. However, the parents are concerned about the flu season and don't want to pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and potential illness. They sent a message explaining this, but the family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't hold the baby. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parents are making a responsible decision to protect their newborn's health. Newborns, even full-term, have developing immune systems and are more vulnerable to infections. The flu season is a real concern. Also, overstimulation can be stressful for a baby, especially in the first few weeks. So the parents have valid reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel hurt or offended. They might see the request as excluding them or not trusting their hygiene. Family traditions and expectations can play a role here. The parents' message was polite but maybe didn't address the emotional aspect enough. The family's reaction seems harsh, but their feelings are real. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus the family's feelings. Medically, the decision makes sense. Socially, the way it was communicated could be improved. The parents could have offered alternatives, like meeting later or having a smaller gathering, to show they still value the family's presence. However, the core issue is about health and safety, which should take precedence.\n\nSo, the parents aren't in the wrong for making a responsible choice. Their family's reaction is unreasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
