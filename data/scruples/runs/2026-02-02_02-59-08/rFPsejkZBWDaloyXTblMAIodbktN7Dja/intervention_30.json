We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn who was born at 37 weeks. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case. The author's text says they're not passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu concerns. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical facts. A full-term pregnancy is typically considered 39-40 weeks, so 37 weeks is early but not extremely premature. However, even a few weeks early can mean the baby's immune system isn't fully developed. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months old. So the parents' worry about exposing the baby to potential illness is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, family might feel excluded or that their traditions are being disrupted. They might not understand the health risks or feel that the parents are being overly cautious. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons, but maybe the family didn't take it well. \n\nFrom a medical standpoint, protecting the baby's health is a priority. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. The family's reaction seems harsh, using a Christmas threat, which is a strong response. The parents didn't say no visitation, just not passing the baby around. The family's offense might stem from not respecting the parents' decision, especially if they didn't consider the health reasons. \n\nThe key points are the parents' right to make healthcare decisions for their child and the family's overreaction. The parents aren't being unreasonable; they're taking precautions. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
