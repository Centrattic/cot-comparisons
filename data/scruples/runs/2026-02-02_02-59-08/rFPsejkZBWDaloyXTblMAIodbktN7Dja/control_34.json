      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the text is the asshole (AITA) for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks. The context is flu season, so they wanted to protect the baby. The family got offended and threatened not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical aspects. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some sources say that 39 weeks is optimal for lung development and other factors. However, 37 weeks is still considered full-term in many standards. The parents might be concerned about the flu, which is a valid health concern, especially for newborns. Their immune systems are not fully developed, so exposure to germs can be risky.\n\nThe parents sent a message in advance to set expectations. They mentioned not wanting the baby over-stimulated and being cautious about the flu. The family's reaction was taking offense and threatening to exclude them from Christmas. That seems harsh. The parents didn't say they wouldn't see the family at all; they just wanted to limit handling the baby. It's about health precautions, especially in flu season. \n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, they have a legitimate reason. The family's reaction seems over-the-top. The parents communicated their decision ahead of time, so they didn't spring it on everyone. They are setting boundaries for their child's well-being. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or family norm that the parents didn't consider. Some families might place a high value on holding the newborn, and the parents not allowing that could be seen as excluding them. But the parents are not excluding anyone from the event\u2014they're just limiting the baby's exposure. \n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's health. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate. The parents are not being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. The family's threat might stem from misunderstanding or not taking the health concerns seriously. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason for their decision, communicated it in advance, and the family's reaction is overly harsh.\n"
