      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new parent not allowing family to pass around their newborn because it's flu season and they don't want the baby overstimulated. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the perspectives here. The parent's reasoning is that they want to protect the baby's health and avoid overstimulation. That makes sense, especially since newborns have underdeveloped immune systems and can be more susceptible to illnesses. Also, handling a newborn can be delicate, so not wanting everyone to hold the baby might be a valid precaution.\n\nOn the other hand, the family felt offended. They might have expected to be allowed to hold the baby, especially during a family gathering. Maybe they didn't anticipate the parents being so cautious. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons, but perhaps the family took it as a personal slight or a lack of trust in their ability to handle the baby.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents had a legitimate reason for their decision. Since the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is full-term, but the parents are still cautious. However, 37 weeks is technically full term, so maybe some might question if the precautions are necessary. But flu season is a real concern, and newborns can get very sick from the flu. So, the parents' caution is understandable.\n\nThe way the message was phrased: \"we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today\" might have been misinterpreted. Maybe the family thought the parents were being exclusive or not allowing interaction. But the parents did invite them to come over and hang out with the baby, just not pass him around. It's a bit ambiguous. Perhaps the parents could have been clearer that they wanted to limit handling but still allow bonding time.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole (AITA), the parents are trying to protect their child's health, which is a valid and responsible action. The family's reaction seems extreme if the parents are being reasonable. However, maybe the parents could have communicated better or found a middle ground, like allowing certain family members to hold the baby with specific precautions.\n\nBut overall, protecting a newborn's health is a common concern, and the parents are within their rights to set boundaries. The family overreacted, so the parents aren't in the wrong. Answer B, No.\n"
