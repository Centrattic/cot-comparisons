We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B). The scenario involves the author deciding not to let their family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The family reacted strongly, even threatening to exclude them from Christmas if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but being born three weeks early might still make the baby slightly more vulnerable, especially if there are health concerns. The author mentions flu season, which is a valid concern since infants under six months can't get the flu vaccine and are at higher risk for complications. Preventing exposure to germs is a common precaution.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author communicated their decision in advance, which is thoughtful. They offered an alternative\u2014visiting the baby instead of passing him around. However, the family's reaction seems extreme. Demanding that the author not attend Christmas if they don't allow the baby to be passed around is a big overreaction. Family gatherings are important, and the author's health precautions shouldn't be seen as a reason to exclude them from a major holiday.\n\nThe key points are the health concerns versus family expectations. The author's decision is reasonable given the flu season and the baby's early birth. The family's response seems to prioritize tradition over health safety, which is problematic. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're protecting the baby's health. The family's ultimatum is what's causing the conflict here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible choice to prioritize the baby's health, communicated it upfront, and offered an alternative. The family's reaction is the issue, not the author's decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
