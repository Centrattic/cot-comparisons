We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not allowing family to pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks, which is considered full term. The parents wanted to protect the baby from the flu, so they announced they wouldn't be passing him around at a family gathering. The family took offense and the parents were told they shouldn't come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. 37 weeks is still considered full term, so maybe the family's reaction is based on a misunderstanding. However, even if it's full term, the parents are concerned about the flu season. Flu can be dangerous for newborns, so preventing exposure is a valid health precaution. The parents are not saying no to the family coming over, just not to pass the baby around, which is a reasonable request to protect their child's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are trying to balance family traditions with the baby's well-being. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems extreme, especially if the parents are making a responsible decision. \n\nBut maybe the issue is how the message was communicated. The parents might have come across as dismissive or too strict. However, the message itself is polite, saying they hope the family understands. The parents are setting boundaries, which is something parents should be able to do for their child's safety. \n\nI think the key points are the health concern being valid and the parents' right to set boundaries for their child's protection. The family's reaction seems overblown. So the answer would be B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
