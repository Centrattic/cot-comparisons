      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Ask AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to be safe. The family reacted strongly, saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the medical aspect. A full-term pregnancy is typically considered 37-40 weeks, but being three weeks early is still within the full-term range. However, even a full-term baby might be more vulnerable to illnesses like the flu, especially in the first few months. So the parents' concern about the baby's health is valid.\n\nNext, the communication. The parents sent a message explaining their decision, which is good. They offered an alternative: inviting the family over to hang out with the baby. The key here is that they're not completely cutting off interaction but setting boundaries to protect the baby. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas if they don't pass around the baby is an overreaction. Families should respect the parents' wishes, especially regarding their child's health. The parents' request is reasonable given the flu season and the baby's early birth. The family's response is more about feeling offended rather than addressing the health concern.\n\nPossible angles to consider: cultural expectations around family traditions, but health should take precedence. Also, the parents are trying to be considerate by allowing interaction in a less invasive way. The family's response is disproportionate. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
