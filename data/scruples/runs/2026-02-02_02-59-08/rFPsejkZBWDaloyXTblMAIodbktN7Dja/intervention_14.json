You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let their family pass around the newborn during Christmas. The family got offended and threatened to not come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what 37 weeks means. I think full term is typically 39-40 weeks, so 37 is considered early term. Babies born at 37 weeks might still be a bit more fragile compared to those born later. The parents are concerned about the flu season and not overstimulating the baby. \n\nThe parents' reasoning is about the baby's health and safety. From a medical standpoint, it's common advice to protect newborns from illnesses, especially in the first few months. Overstimulation can also be a valid concern for newborns. However, the parents communicated this in a way that might have been perceived as excluding the family rather than inviting them in a different way.\n\nThe original text they sent was: \"We aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude...\" So they are allowing visitors but not handing the baby around. The family's reaction was to say if that's the case, they shouldn't come to Christmas. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have a legitimate reason. Newborn health is important. However, the way they phrased it might have come off as dismissive or not considering the family's feelings. Maybe they could have been more proactive in suggesting alternatives, like having a special time to meet the baby or emphasizing that they're still welcome but just need to follow certain precautions. \n\nBut the parents did invite the family over. The issue is about passing the baby around. The family might have felt it's a tradition or a way to bond, and the parents' refusal was seen as not allowing that bonding. However, the parents are within their rights to protect their child's health. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable. The parents are acting in the best interest of their newborn. The family's reaction is harsh, but the parents aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's safety. The text they sent was polite and offered an alternative (coming over to hang out), so maybe the problem was the family's overreaction. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had a valid reason and communicated it politely, even inviting the family to visit. The family's response is the issue here.\n"
