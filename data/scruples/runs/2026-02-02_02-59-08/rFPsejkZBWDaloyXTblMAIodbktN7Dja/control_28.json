      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the family had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early, and they decided not to let their family members hold or pass around the newborn during a Christmas gathering. They sent a message explaining that it's due to flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. But this caused a rift, with some family members saying they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born three weeks early, which is 37 weeks. Full term is typically 40 weeks, so 37 is considered early but not extremely preterm. However, even a few weeks early can mean the baby is more vulnerable. Flu season is a concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months, so they're at higher risk. Overstimulation is another factor; newborns, especially preemies, need a lot of rest and can get overwhelmed by too much activity or handling.\n\nThe parents are trying to protect their baby, which is a common concern for new parents. The message they sent was polite and explained the reasons, yet the family took offense. The key here is whether the parents overstepped by not allowing family to hold the baby, even with good intentions.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, protecting a vulnerable newborn is a priority. Medical advice often recommends limiting visitors and handling for preemies, especially during flu season. The parents are not keeping the baby from the family entirely\u2014they're allowing them to be present and interact in other ways, just not passing the baby around. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, some family members might feel excluded or upset if they expected to hold the baby. However, the parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. The family's reaction seems harsh, as the parents provided a clear explanation and are still inviting them to the gathering. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas over this seems overly reactionary.\n\nSo, the parents are acting in the best interest of their baby, following medical advice, and communicating their concerns upfront. The family's offense seems unwarranted. Therefore, the parents aren't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
