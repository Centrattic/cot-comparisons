We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but just barely. They decided not to let their family pass around the newborn during a family gathering around Christmas. Their reasoning was to avoid over-stimulation and to be cautious about the flu season. However, this decision caused offense to the entire family, leading to a threat of not being invited to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's decision was reasonable. Newborns, even when born at 37 weeks, are still considered preterm to some extent. Medical guidelines often recommend extra precautions for preterm babies, such as avoiding exposure to crowds and potential illnesses. Flu season is a valid concern because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. So, from a health and safety perspective, the parents' decision to limit handling the baby makes sense.\n\nHowever, family gatherings are important for many people, and the way the message was communicated might have contributed to the family's hurt feelings. The original text says they \"just wanted to let everyone know in advance\" and mentions concerns about over-stimulation and the flu. The key here is whether the message was clear and considerate. They did invite the family over and allowed them to interact with the baby under their conditions. The problem might be that the family felt excluded or that their traditions were being ignored, leading to the conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of boundaries. Parents have the right to set boundaries regarding their child's care. If the family members are close, they might expect a certain level of access, especially with a new baby. However, the parents also have the right to prioritize their child's health. The reaction from the family, ending Christmas plans, seems extreme. It's possible the family felt disrespected or that their efforts to bond with the newborn were being denied without proper explanation or compromise.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The main factors are the health of the baby versus family expectations. The author's reasoning is medically sound, but the communication might have been lacking empathy or clarity. However, the family's overreaction to a reasonable precaution suggests they might be at fault here. The author did make an effort to inform the family in advance and offered an alternative (visiting but not holding the baby). So, while the author could have communicated differently, the core decision seems justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
