      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't let their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). They texted the family in advance, explaining they didn't want the baby overstimulated or exposed to the flu, and instead invited them to hang out. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A full-term pregnancy is typically 40 weeks, so 37 weeks is considered early term. Premature babies can have more health risks, but 37 weeks is technically not very early. The parents are concerned about overstimulation and the flu, which is a common precaution, especially for infants. However, the family's reaction was quite strong, leading to the parents being accused of being unwelcoming.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The key points here are the parents' reasons and the family's reaction. The parents are acting in the baby's best interest, which is a common practice. However, maybe the way they communicated it was off-putting. The original text says \"pass around\" instead of \"hold\" the baby, which might imply a more casual or excessive handling. The family might have felt excluded or not considered trustworthy, especially if they are used to holding babies during holidays.\n\nBut from the text, the author says they invited the family to hang out with the baby, just not to pass him around. The main concern is the flu season and overstimulation. The family's reaction to such a reasonable precaution being taken is disproportionate. It's possible that the family didn't take the parents' concerns seriously and felt slighted. In many cases, families understand the need to protect a newborn, especially if there are health reasons. The fact that the baby was born at 37 weeks might not be a major medical red flag, but the parents are still within their rights to be cautious.\n\nAnother angle is the cultural expectation around holidays. In some families, holding the baby is a significant part of the celebration, and not allowing it might be seen as a rejection. However, the parents did offer an alternative\u2014coming over to hang out with the baby, which suggests they wanted to be inclusive but with their own terms. The family's response seems to be taking the parents at their word, interpreting the refusal to pass the baby as a refusal of their presence, hence the threat about Christmas.\n\nI need to consider if the parents' message was clear. They mentioned not passing the baby around, which could be confusing. Maybe they should have specified that the baby is being held by the parents only, but the family is welcome to interact in other ways. However, the parents did mention being careful about flu season and overstimulation, which are valid points. The family's offense might stem from feeling that their presence is a threat or that they're being excluded, which is not the parents' intention.\n\nIn terms of medical aspects, a baby born at 37 weeks is usually okay, but some preemies may need more care. The parents are erring on the side of caution, which is understandable. The family's reaction seems to be more about feeling personally attacked rather than the actual safety of the baby. \n\nSo, the parents are not in the wrong. They have a legitimate concern, and the family's overreaction is the issue here. The author's text seems reasonable, though maybe the term \"pass around\" could have been phrased better. But the core reason\u2014health and overstimulation\u2014is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
