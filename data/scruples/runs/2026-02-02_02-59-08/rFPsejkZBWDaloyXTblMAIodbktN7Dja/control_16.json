      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's son was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They decided not to let their family pass around the newborn during a Christmas gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense and the situation escalated to a Christmas Eve confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby is born at 37 weeks, which is considered \"barely full term.\" Some sources say that 37-38 weeks is considered early term, and while babies born at 37 weeks are generally okay, they might still be at a slightly higher risk for certain complications compared to full-term babies (which is 39-40 weeks). So the parents have a valid health concern, especially during flu season.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in a polite message, explaining that they don't want the baby overstimulated and are worried about the flu. They invited the family to come over and interact but set a boundary about not passing the baby around. The family's reaction was to say that if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. That seems harsh and dismissive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible angles here are: the parents' right to protect their baby's health, the family's right to feel respected, and communication issues.\n\nOn one hand, the parents are trying to ensure the baby's well-being. Flu season is a real concern, and even if the family is healthy, there's a risk of spreading germs. Also, newborns, even full-term, can be sensitive to overstimulation. The parents are setting boundaries, which is reasonable, especially for a baby born early. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel that the parents are being overly cautious or dismissive of their intentions. The family's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not being trusted, even though the parents' message was meant to be respectful. The phrase \"you should probably not come to Christmas\" is a strong response, which might indicate that the family took it personally.\n\nBut the key here is that the parents made their decision clear in a polite way. They didn't say the family couldn't come over, just that they wouldn't pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems to be taking it as a personal offense rather than a health precaution. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they are prioritizing the baby's health. \n\nIn similar situations, it's common for new parents to set boundaries to protect their newborns, especially if there are health concerns. The fact that the baby was born at 37 weeks adds a layer of caution that might be more necessary. The family's response is more about their own feelings of being excluded rather than the parents being unreasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They communicated their needs respectfully and have a legitimate reason for their decision. The family's reaction is disproportionate and dismissive of the parents' concerns. So the answer should be B.\n"
