You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's son was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. They decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a family gathering, and the family took offense, leading to a Christmas rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A full-term pregnancy is typically 37 weeks or later, so technically, the baby was born at full term. However, being three weeks early might still be considered preterm in some contexts, especially if there were complications. The parents are concerned about the flu season and overstimulation, which are valid reasons to protect a newborn. Newborns are more vulnerable to infections, and limiting exposure can be a responsible choice.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas is a strong response. The author's message was clear and polite, explaining their reasons. They didn't refuse the family from visiting entirely but just wanted to avoid passing the baby around, which could involve physical contact and potential exposure.\n\nThe parents are making a reasonable health decision for their child. It's common for new parents to set boundaries, especially with a newborn's health. The family's offense might stem from not understanding the medical concerns or feeling excluded. However, the parents have the right to prioritize their baby's well-being.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was unreasonable or inconsiderate. Here, the parents acted in the baby's best interest, communicated their stance, and offered an alternative (visiting without handling the baby). The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
