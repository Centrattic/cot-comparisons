We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family was invited to Christmas but the author decided not to have them pass the baby around, citing safety concerns due to flu season and over-stimulation. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but still considered early. Flu season is a real concern because newborns have underdeveloped immune systems and are more vulnerable to infections. Over-stimulation from a large family gathering could also stress the baby. The author's decision seems to be based on legitimate medical reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction is about being excluded from a bonding moment. The author's message was polite, explaining the reasons. But the family took it as a personal slight. It's possible they were expecting to hold the baby and felt their exclusion was disrespectful. However, the author's priority is their child's health, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they made a decision based on safety, communicated it clearly, and offered an alternative (visiting the baby). The family's reaction seems overly harsh. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
