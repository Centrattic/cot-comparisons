      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family got upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born three weeks early, which is considered preterm. 37 weeks is technically full term, but still early. The parents wanted to avoid the flu season, so they decided not to have family pass around the baby. They sent a message ahead of time explaining their reasons: not overstimulating the baby and flu concerns. But the family took offense, and now there's a conflict about Christmas plans.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, new parents often have strong feelings about protecting their newborn, especially if the baby was born early. Health concerns are valid, and flu season can be a legitimate reason to limit contact. The parents did communicate their decision in advance, which is good. They also allowed the family to come over and interact with the baby, just not to pass him around, which might mean handling him but not a chain of people passing him.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Saying they shouldn't come to Christmas because of this seems like a big overreaction. However, family dynamics can be complex. The parents might have felt their decision was reasonable, but the family might have felt excluded or disrespected. The parents' message was polite, so it's unclear why it caused such a strong reaction. Maybe the family had different views on bonding or felt it was a slight against them. \n\nFrom a health perspective, protecting a preterm infant is important. The CDC and other health organizations do recommend that newborns, especially preemies, avoid too many people during flu season. So the parents' reasoning is sound. The family might not be aware of the specific risks, leading to misunderstanding. \n\nBut the parents could have handled it more delicately. Maybe they could have suggested specific ways the family could interact without passing the baby around, like sitting with the parents while the baby is with them. However, they did mention that the family can come over and hang out with the baby, which implies some interaction is allowed. \n\nThe key here is whether the parents' decision was reasonable. Since the baby was born early and flu season is a factor, their concerns are valid. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. Therefore, the parents are not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
