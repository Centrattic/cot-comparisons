      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The family was invited to meet the baby, but the parents mentioned they wouldn't be passing the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu season risks. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but maybe they were still concerned about health, especially with flu season. It's common for new parents to be cautious about their baby's health, especially with visitors. They mentioned the baby shouldn't be overstimulated, which is a valid concern. Newborns can get easily overwhelmed in busy environments.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in a polite way, saying the family is welcome to come over but not pass the baby around. They provided reasons (health and overstimulation), which seems reasonable. However, the family took offense and made a strong statement about not attending Christmas. That's a harsh reaction, but the question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, even though 37 weeks is considered full term, some health risks still exist compared to a 40-week baby. The flu season is a real threat, and parents might want to protect their baby. The parents' request seems like a precautionary measure. They didn't ban visitors but set a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the family felt slighted because they expected to hold the baby, which is a common tradition. But the parents had a legitimate reason. The family's reaction seems exaggerated. However, the parents might have been more considerate in their wording. Phrases like \"we don't want him over-stimulated\" might not be clear to everyone. Maybe they could have been more specific about their concerns or offered alternatives, like designated times for visitors to hold the baby if it's okay.\n\nBut the main issue is whether refusing to pass the baby around is unreasonable. I think the parents have a right to protect their child's health and well-being. The family's response seems unkind and overly reactive. So, in this case, the parents aren't in the wrong. They made a reasonable decision for their baby's safety. The family overreacted. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
