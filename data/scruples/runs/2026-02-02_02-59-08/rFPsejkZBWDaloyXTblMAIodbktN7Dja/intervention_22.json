We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about a new parent who decided not to let their family pass around their newborn, who was born 3 weeks early (37 weeks is considered full term, but maybe early in their context). The family was upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the scenario. The author's reasoning is that they want to keep the baby safe from the flu and avoid overstimulation. The family took offense, interpreting it as the author not trusting them to hold the baby. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but maybe there are still some concerns about their immune system, especially during flu season. The parents are making a precautionary choice. On the other hand, family members might feel excluded or as if their intentions are being questioned by not allowing them to hold the baby.\n\nThe key points here are: the parents' right to protect their child's health versus family members' feelings about being excluded. The author's message seems respectful, saying they don't want to pass him around but are open to the family coming over. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe they felt disrespected. \n\nI need to decide if the author's decision to not pass the baby is reasonable. From a health perspective, especially with a slightly premature baby, it's common for parents to be cautious. However, the family might not understand that precaution, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I should evaluate based on the information. The author's reasoning is valid, but the way they communicated it might have been a factor. However, the message seems polite and clear. The family's reaction might be overblown, but the author did state their boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to protect their child's health, and their communication was upfront. The family's response is more about their own feelings than the author's actions being objectively wrong. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n"
