We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. They mentioned it's flu season, so they wanted to avoid passing the baby around. But the family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to check if 37 weeks is considered full term. I remember that full term is typically 37-40 weeks, so a baby born at 37 weeks is just at the start of full term. However, even full-term babies can be more vulnerable, especially in flu season. The parents are taking a precaution, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe message they sent was polite, explaining their concerns about overstimulation and flu. They invited the family over but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's possible the family didn't expect or agree with the restrictions, leading to the argument.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole. The key points are the parents' right to protect their newborn and the family's overreaction. Precautions for a newborn's health are generally seen as responsible. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
