We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The question is whether they were justified in not letting their family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during a flu season. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but being three weeks early could still mean the baby is more vulnerable to infections. The flu can be particularly dangerous for newborns, so taking precautions makes sense. The parents wanted to avoid overstimulation and reduce the risk of the baby getting sick. That seems like a reasonable concern.\n\nNow, looking at the family's reaction. The family was offended and threatened to not come to Christmas if the parents didn't let them hold the baby. The parents had already communicated their decision in advance with a message that was polite and explained their reasons. The family's response seems harsh, possibly because they didn't consider the health risks and saw the decision as a personal slight. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' right to make decisions about their child's health and the family's right to their feelings. The parents are not obligated to let others hold their child, especially if they have health concerns. The family's reaction of cutting out the parents from a holiday event seems extreme and possibly a misunderstanding of the situation. \n\nSo, the parents are acting in the best interest of their baby, and the family is overreacting. The author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
