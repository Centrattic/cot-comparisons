      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a newborn who was born 3 weeks early, at 37 weeks, and they decided not to let their family hold or pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby is considered full-term at 37 weeks, but it's still early. The parents are concerned about the flu season and not over-stimulating the baby. The family seems upset that they can't hold the baby, even though the parents are allowing them to come over and hang out with the baby. The parents are asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nI think the main issue here is the family's reaction. The parents are setting a boundary for health reasons, which is reasonable, especially with a preterm baby. However, the family is taking it as an insult, interpreting it as the parents not wanting them to be part of the baby's life. The parents did communicate their decision in a polite way, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and explaining their reasons. \n\nThe question is whether the parents are wrong for setting this boundary. On one hand, protecting the baby's health is a valid concern. On the other hand, the family might feel excluded or not trusted. But the parents did allow the family to visit and interact, just not to hold or pass around the baby. \n\nIn similar situations, it's common for new parents to set boundaries to protect their newborn, especially if there are health concerns. The key is how it's communicated. The parents here did explain their reasons, so it's not a blanket \"no interaction\" but a specific precaution. The family's reaction seems overly harsh, possibly misunderstanding the parents' intentions. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their decision, and setting such boundaries is common practice. The family's response is the more questionable part here. The parents are prioritizing the baby's health, which is a responsibility, and shouldn't be blamed for that.\n"
