We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks and the parents not wanting to let the family pass around the baby during Christmas due to concerns about the flu and overstimulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if 37 weeks is considered full term. I remember that full term is typically 37-40 weeks. So 37 weeks is technically full term. However, some sources might say that 39 weeks is considered full term. Wait, maybe I should check that. But since the user is asking for an immediate answer, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. If 37 is considered early full term, maybe the parents are being cautious. \n\nThe parents' main reasons are flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. Flu season is a legitimate health concern, especially for a newborn who hasn't built up immunity yet. Exposure to a lot of people could increase the risk of illness. Also, new environments and lots of people can be stressful for a newborn, so not wanting to overstimulate is reasonable.\n\nThe family's reaction was taking offense and threatening to not come to Christmas. That seems like an overreaction. The parents communicated their decision respectfully, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and inviting them to hang out. They didn't say the family couldn't visit the baby at all, just not to pass him around. So the parents are setting a boundary for the baby's well-being, and the family's response is cutting off the holiday. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? It seems like no. They have valid health reasons, and it's their decision to protect their child. The family is reacting negatively to a reasonable precaution. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
