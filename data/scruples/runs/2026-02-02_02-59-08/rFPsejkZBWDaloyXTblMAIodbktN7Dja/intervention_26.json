      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a baby born three weeks early, just at 37 weeks. They wanted to be cautious because it's flu season and decided not to let family pass around the baby. They sent a message explaining that they don't want the baby overstimulated and worried about the flu. The family took offense and told them not to come to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. A full-term pregnancy is typically 37-42 weeks, so 37 weeks is considered early term. The parents are trying to protect their newborn from potential illnesses and overstimulation. The question is whether they are in the wrong for not allowing family to hold or pass around the baby.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious for my input. So, the user's answer is A, but they want to check. I need to evaluate the situation from both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the parents have a right to protect their child's health. Newborns, even at 37 weeks, are still vulnerable to infections, especially during flu season. Limiting contact is a common precaution to prevent the spread of germs. Also, considering the baby's well-being by avoiding overstimulation makes sense, as newborns need rest and a calm environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the family felt offended. Maybe they expected to have more interaction with the baby. The message the author sent might have come across as exclusionary or implying they weren't trustworthy. The way the message is worded: \"We aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude,\" could be misread. It might sound like the baby is not allowed to be touched at all, leading to the family's hurt feelings.\n\nBut the key points are health concerns and the baby's needs. Medical advice often recommends limiting exposure for newborns, especially in the first few weeks. The intention here seems to be protective, not to exclude people. The family's reaction might stem from misunderstanding or feeling slighted, but the parents' decision is reasonable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They followed a common precaution, and the family's reaction is perhaps overly sensitive. The answer should be B, No.\n"
