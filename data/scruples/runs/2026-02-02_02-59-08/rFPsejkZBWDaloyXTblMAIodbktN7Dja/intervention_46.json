      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their newborn, born three weeks early at 37 weeks, isn't being passed around during a family gathering because of flu season concerns. The family got upset and mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but some might argue that being three weeks early could make the baby slightly more vulnerable, especially during flu season. However, the medical community often considers 37 weeks as full-term, so maybe the risk isn't as high as the family is implying. But the parents are erring on the side of caution, which is common for new parents.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The parents did communicate their decision in advance, which is respectful. They explained their reasons: avoiding overstimulation and flu concerns. Their message was polite and inviting, allowing the family to visit but not handle the baby. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially threatening to not come to Christmas. That seems disproportionate, as the parents are setting boundaries for their child's well-being.\n\nNow, considering cultural or family expectations. In some families, holding a newborn is a significant tradition, and refusing might be seen as a slight. However, health and safety should take precedence. The parents have the right to protect their baby, even if it upsets extended family.\n\nThe parents' message was clear and kind. They didn't say \"no\" outright but set the terms. The family's response suggests they feel excluded or disrespected, but the parents' priority is their child's health. So, the parents aren't being unreasonable. The family's reaction is more about their own feelings than the actual risk to the baby.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
