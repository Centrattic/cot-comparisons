We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but the family decided not to let relatives pass around the baby during Christmas. The parents sent a message explaining they wanted to avoid over-stimulation and the flu. The family took offense, and now the parents are asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parents' actions are reasonable. 37 weeks is technically full term, but being three weeks early might still be considered a bit premature. However, even if the baby is healthy, there's a common practice among new parents to be cautious with visitors and handling the baby, especially around the holidays when people are sick more often. Flu season is a real concern, as newborns have underdeveloped immune systems. \n\nThe parents communicated their decision in advance, which is good. They mentioned not wanting the baby over-stimulated and worried about the flu. These are valid concerns. However, the family's reaction was strong, leading to a Christmas rift. The key points here are the parents' right to set boundaries for their child's health and the family's right to feel included. \n\nIn many cultures, especially around holidays, there's an expectation to share the joy, including the new baby. But parents have the authority to make decisions about their child's care. The message seems polite, so the parents did their part to explain. The family's response might be more about feeling excluded rather than a medical concern. \n\nConsidering all that, the parents are acting in their child's best interest. They didn't refuse visitors; they just didn't want the baby passed around. It's a reasonable precaution, even if some relatives are upset. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
