We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early term. They decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense and mentioned they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's how they feel. The author is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's actions. 37 weeks is technically full term, but still a bit early. The parents are cautious about germs and overstimulation, which are valid concerns for newborns. However, they phrased it as \"passing him around,\" which might come off as dismissive. The family's reaction is strong, but their response of canceling Christmas seems extreme.\n\nThe author's message was polite, explaining their reasons. They offered the family to come over and hang out. So, their intention was to set boundaries for the baby's safety. The family taking it as a personal offense might be their issue. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child. Protecting a newborn from illness is a common-sense precaution. However, maybe the phrasing could have been more considerate. But the main point is that the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their baby's health. The family overreacted. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
