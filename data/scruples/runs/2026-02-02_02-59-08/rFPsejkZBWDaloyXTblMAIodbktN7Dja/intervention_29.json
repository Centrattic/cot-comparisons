We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a newborn who was born three weeks early, at 37 weeks. The parents decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering. The family was upset and said if that's how they feel, they shouldn't come to Christmas. The parents texted explaining their reasons: not wanting the baby overstimulated and concerns about the flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. A 37-week baby is considered preterm, though some might say it's \"barely full term.\" Preemies can have more health risks, so avoiding too many people and potential illnesses makes sense. The parents are trying to protect their child's health. They also mention not wanting the baby overstimulated, which is common with new parents who want to limit stress for their infant.\n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. Telling them not to come to Christmas if they don't want to share the baby is a strong response. Families often have different customs, but cutting off an event over a baby's health precautions seems extreme. The parents did invite the family to hang out, just not to pass the baby around. That's a reasonable middle ground.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents' decision was reasonable. Since the baby was born early, the parents' concerns are valid. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling excluded. However, the parents are not preventing family from attending; they're just setting boundaries for the baby's safety. \n\nThe text message the parents sent is polite and explains their reasons. They didn't say no to the gathering, just modified the interaction. The family's punishment of not inviting them to Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are acting in the best interest of their child. The family's reaction is more about their feelings of exclusion rather than a valid health concern. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
