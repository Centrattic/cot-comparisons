We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting the family pass around their newborn who was born three weeks early. The situation is that they sent a message explaining they don't want to pass the baby around due to flu season and not wanting him overstimulated. The family reacted strongly, saying if that's how they feel, then they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but technically, 37 weeks is early by a few weeks. However, in many medical contexts, 37 weeks is still considered full-term. But maybe the parents are being cautious because of the flu season. It's possible they're worried about germs, even if the baby is technically full-term. The parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child, so if they feel it's safer to avoid passing the baby around, that's their choice.\n\nThen there's the family's reaction. The parents communicated their decision in a polite way, explaining the reasons. But the family took it as an offense and threatened to exclude them from Christmas. That seems harsh. The parents didn't say no visitors; they just don't want the baby passed around. It's about the baby's health and well-being, not about excluding the family.\n\nI think the parents are in the right here. They're making a reasonable decision for their baby's safety. The family's overreaction is more of an issue. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, maybe some people might think that being born at 37 weeks isn't early enough to warrant such precautions. But given that flu season is a real concern and the parents are cautious, their stance makes sense. The problem is on the family side for taking offense and using the Christmas threat. So B is correct.\n"
