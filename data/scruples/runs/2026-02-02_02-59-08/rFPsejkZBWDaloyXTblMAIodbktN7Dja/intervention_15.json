We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new parent who decided not to let family members pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). The parent sent a message explaining their decision to avoid overstimulation and flu risks, but the family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's how they feel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, but being born three weeks early might still be considered \"barely full term\" depending on medical definitions. However, from a health perspective, 37 weeks is generally safe. The parent's concern is about the flu season and overstimulation. \n\nNow, the parent's message was intended to set boundaries for the baby's well-being. But the family's reaction was strong, threatening to not attend Christmas. The key question is whether the parent's decision was reasonable and if the family overreacted.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, protecting a newborn from potential illnesses and overstimulation is a common practice, especially in the first few months. Parents often set rules to ensure the baby's health. Flu season is a real concern, and many parents might prefer limited handling of their infants during that time. \n\nHowever, the term \"passing around\" can be sensitive. Some families might see this as a normal part of gatherings, and being excluded from holding the baby might feel like a rejection. The parent's message is polite and offers an alternative (visiting the baby), but the family's reaction seems harsh. \n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Probably not. They made a decision based on their baby's needs. The family's response seems disproportionate. The parent's request is reasonable, and the family's threat to skip Christmas seems like an overreaction. \n\nBut wait, maybe the family felt slighted because they wanted to hold the baby, which is a common tradition. However, the parent's right to set boundaries for their child's health should be respected. So, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
