We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a baby born at 37 weeks, which is considered early by some standards but technically full-term. They told their family they wouldn't be passing the baby around during a Christmas gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family was upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are reasonable. The baby was born three weeks early. While 37 weeks is still considered full-term by medical definitions (which is 37-40 weeks), some sources might say that 37 weeks is \"early term\" and can have some risks. So the parents might have valid reasons to be cautious. They mentioned flu season, which is a legitimate concern because newborns can't get the flu vaccine until six months old, making them more vulnerable. Also, avoiding overstimulation is common for newborns, especially if they're a bit preterm.\n\nThe author's message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family over to see the baby but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not come to Christmas because they don't want to hold the baby seems excessive. Family gatherings can be stressful, and it's reasonable for new parents to set health and comfort boundaries, especially for a preterm baby.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasons are valid and responsible. The family's response is overreacting. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
