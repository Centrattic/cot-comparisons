We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn. The baby was born three weeks early at 37 weeks, which is considered preterm but close to full term. The parents wanted to keep the baby safe during flu season and communicated this to the family. The family took offense and even said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's their stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' reasoning. 37 weeks is often considered full term in some contexts, but others might still see it as preterm. The parents are concerned about over-stimulation and flu exposure, which are valid health concerns for a preterm infant. Their message was clear and polite, offering the family to come over but not handling the baby. The family reacted negatively, which seems more about their feelings being hurt rather than the parents' actions.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The key points here are the parents' right to protect their child's health versus family expectations. Health concerns for a vulnerable infant should take precedence. The parents communicated their decision respectfully, so it's unlikely they're the ones being unreasonable. The family's reaction, leading to a Christmas conflict, seems more about their own discomfort with the situation rather than any wrongdoing by the parents.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents made a responsible decision for their baby's health and communicated it clearly, which is reasonable. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' choice.\n"
