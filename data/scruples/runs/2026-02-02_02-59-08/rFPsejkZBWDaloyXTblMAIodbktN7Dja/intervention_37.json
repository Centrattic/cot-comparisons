We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, which was born three weeks early. The situation is during the flu season, and the family got offended, leading to a Christmas conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term by some definitions but early by others. The parents decided not to let family pass the baby around, citing concerns about over-stimulation and the flu. The family took offense, and now there's a rift.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants others' opinions. I have to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break it down. From a medical perspective, a 37-week baby is considered full-term in some places, but others might still consider it preterm. Either way, the parents' decision is based on health concerns, especially flu season. It's common for new parents to set boundaries to protect their baby's health. However, family might feel excluded or not respected, especially during a festive time like Christmas.\n\nThe parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over but just not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems a bit harsh, but maybe they were expecting to hold the baby and felt it was a slight. \n\nI think the parents have a valid reason. Protecting the baby's health is a priority, and they communicated it. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate. However, maybe there's more context not mentioned here. But based on the info given, the parents are acting in their child's best interest. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
