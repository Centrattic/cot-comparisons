We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting family pass around their newborn, which was born 37 weeks, considered early but not extremely preterm. The baby is described as \"barely full term,\" so maybe 37 weeks is considered full term in some contexts.\n\nThe situation is during flu season, and the parents wanted to avoid passing the baby around to prevent overstimulation and potential flu exposure. The family took offense and said not to come to Christmas if that's the case. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, think about the parents' perspective. Newborns, even if born at 37 weeks, might be more vulnerable to illnesses. Flu season is a real concern, and parents might be cautious. They wanted to keep the baby safe, which is a common parental instinct. However, the way they communicated this might have been a problem. The message starts with a Merry Christmas and mentions not passing the baby around, which could be seen as a polite request, but maybe the family felt excluded or that their presence wasn't wanted. \n\nNow, cultural norms might play a role. In some families, passing around a newborn is a cherished tradition, especially during holidays. If the parents didn't explain the health reasons clearly or if the family felt it was a slight, that could lead to offense. The response from the family was harsh, cutting off Christmas plans, which seems extreme, but maybe they felt hurt.\n\nThe parents had a valid concern for the baby's health, but perhaps the way they handled it could have been better. Maybe they could have offered alternatives, like allowing visits with certain precautions (e.g., handwashing, no sick people coming), or inviting them over to see the baby without passing him around. The key here is that the parents had a legitimate reason, but the family's reaction was also extreme. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the act itself\u2014prioritizing the baby's health\u2014is not wrong. However, communication might have been an issue. The message says they \"aren't going to be passing (baby) around today,\" which could be taken as a refusal to allow interaction. If they had framed it as a safety measure to protect the baby, maybe the family would have been more understanding. But since the family took it as a personal offense, the author might be seen as not considering their feelings, but the root cause is the family's overreaction.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because their main intent was to protect the baby's health, which is a valid reason. The family's reaction is the issue, not the author's decision.\n"
