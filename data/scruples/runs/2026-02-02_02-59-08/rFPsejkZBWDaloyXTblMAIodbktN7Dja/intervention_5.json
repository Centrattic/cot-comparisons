We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the situation is about a new parent who had a baby born 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe the hospital said he was slightly early. The parents decided not to let their family pass around the baby during a gathering, probably during Christmas. The parents gave the reasoning that it's flu season and they don't want the baby overstimulated. The family members were offended and said if that's the case, they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. 37 weeks is technically full term, but sometimes people might still consider it \"early\" if the baby was born before 39 weeks. However, the main issue here is the parents' decision to not pass around the baby. Is this a reasonable request?\n\nFrom a health perspective, flu season is a legitimate concern. Newborns, especially those born early (even if 37 weeks is full term), might have more fragile immune systems. So the parents are trying to protect the baby from potential illnesses. Also, overstimulation is common with newborns, too many people handling them can be stressful.\n\nOn the other hand, the family perceived this as a rejection or offense. They might feel that the parents are being overly cautious or are excluding them. But the message from the parents was clear and polite. They invited the family over, just not to pass the baby. So maybe the family took it as a personal slight when it wasn't meant that way.\n\nThe key points are: the parents had a valid reason (health and overstimulation), they communicated it politely, and the family overreacted. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. The family might be the ones being unreasonable, expecting to hold the baby and getting upset when it's not possible. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
