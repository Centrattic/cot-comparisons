We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that they told the family in advance, but it caused an offense, leading to a Christmas conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is technically full term, but early enough that there might be health concerns. The parents mention it's flu season and they don't want the baby overstimulated. They communicated their decision in a polite message. \n\nNow, the family's reaction seems harsh. The parents did inform them beforehand, so the invitation to come over but not pass the baby around is a middle ground. The family's response was to exclude them from Christmas, which seems disproportionate. \n\nFrom a health perspective, protecting a newborn, especially a slightly premature one, during flu season is reasonable. Parents have the right to make medical decisions for their child. The author's message was clear and polite, so there's no indication of rudeness. The family's reaction is more about their own feelings of being excluded rather than a valid health concern. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted in the baby's best interest and communicated it properly. The fault lies with the family's overreaction. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
