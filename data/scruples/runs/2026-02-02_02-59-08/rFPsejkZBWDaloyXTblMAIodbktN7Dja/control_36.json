      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing family to pass around their newborn, who was born 3 weeks early (37 weeks). The parents are worried about the flu season and don't want the baby overstimulated. The family members were offended and even threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A 37-week pregnancy is considered early term. While the baby is likely healthy, the parents are concerned about flu season. Flu can be serious for newborns, especially those born even a bit early. The parents are trying to protect their baby by limiting handling and overstimulation. Their message was polite and explained the reasons clearly.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. Saying \"you shouldn't come to Christmas\" because they don't want the baby handled is extreme. It's possible the family members didn't take their concerns seriously and felt it was a personal rejection. However, the parents have a valid medical and safety reason. They're also setting boundaries for their child's well-being, which is their right.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents are prioritizing their baby's health. The family members overreacting might not understand the risks. The parents communicated their decision clearly, so they aren't being inconsiderate. The family's response is more indicative of their own feelings than the parents' wrongdoing. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
