We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term but maybe a bit early. The parents decided not to let the family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering because of flu season concerns and wanting to avoid overstimulation. The family took offense and threatened to not come to Christmas.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if the parents were reasonable in their decision. 37 weeks is technically full term, but some sources might consider it early term. However, even if the baby is healthy, the parents might have valid concerns about infections, especially during flu season. Newborns can be more vulnerable to illnesses, so limiting exposure could be a precaution. Also, overstimulation from too many people handling the baby might be a valid reason to keep interactions limited.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in advance with a polite message. They invited the family to visit but emphasized not passing the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to skip Christmas over this. It's possible the family felt slighted or didn't understand the medical reasoning. But the parents had a legitimate concern for the baby's health and well-being.\n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? In some cultures, not allowing family to hold a newborn might be seen as disrespectful or exclusionary. However, the parents are making a health-based decision. The key is whether their action was reasonable. Since they gave prior notice and explained their reasons, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The family's response seems overreactive. The parents are prioritizing the baby's safety, which is a common-sense approach. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
