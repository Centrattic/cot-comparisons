We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about a newborn born 37 weeks (which is actually considered full-term, but maybe that's a detail people might miss). The parents decided not to let their extended family pass around the baby during Christmas, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to recall if 37 weeks is considered full-term. I think there's a distinction between full-term and early term. Full-term is typically 39-40 weeks, but 37 weeks is early term. So maybe the parents are being cautious because the baby is a bit younger than full-term. However, the family took offense, leading to a rift over Christmas plans.\n\nThe parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They didn't say \"no\" outright but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh, but maybe some people don't understand the medical reasons. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong for setting this boundary.\n\nArguments against the parents: Maybe they are being overly cautious, or maybe they didn't consider the family's feelings. However, the post says they were \"offended the entire family,\" which suggests the family might be inconsiderate. The parents have the right to protect their child's health, especially in flu season. \n\n37 weeks is still a viable birth, but the baby might need more care. Even if it's a minor early term, the parents' decision could be medically sound. The family's reaction seems disproportionate. So the answer would be B, the parents are not in the wrong. They're prioritizing the baby's well-being. The family should respect that decision.\n"
