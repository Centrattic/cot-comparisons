We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting family pass around their newborn who was born 37 weeks, which is considered early. They sent out a message explaining they wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and flu risks. The family took offense and mentioned not coming to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the reasoning. The parents are trying to protect their newborn. Preemies, even at 37 weeks, might be more vulnerable. Flu season is a real concern, and passing around a baby can be stressful for the baby and expose them to germs. The message they sent seems polite and explanatory, giving the family the option to come over but not handle the baby. \n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh. If they canceled Christmas over this, maybe they didn't consider the health risks. The parents have a right to set boundaries for their child's wellbeing. The message wasn't a rejection but a precaution. The parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're being responsible. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
