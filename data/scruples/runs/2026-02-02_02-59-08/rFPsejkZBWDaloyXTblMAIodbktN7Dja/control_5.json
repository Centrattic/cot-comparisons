We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early at 37 weeks. The parents explained they wanted to keep the baby safe from the flu, but their family reacted negatively, even threatening to not come to Christmas if that's how they felt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A 37-week baby is considered full-term, but some sources say that 37-38 weeks might be considered \"late preterm.\" These babies can sometimes have more health risks compared to those born at 39 weeks or later. So, even though the baby was born early, it's a relatively common occurrence. The parents are concerned about the flu season, which is a valid health concern. Flu can be particularly dangerous for infants, so limiting exposure to people might be a precaution they're taking.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in a polite way, saying the family is welcome to come over and see the baby but not to pass him around. They mentioned over-stimulation and flu concerns. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially since the parents didn't say no to the family coming over at all. They just set a boundary about handling the baby.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents' request is reasonable. Protecting a newborn's health is a common practice, especially in the first few months. Many parents set boundaries about who can hold their baby, especially if there are health concerns. The family's response\u2014telling them not to come to Christmas\u2014seems excessive. The parents aren't excluding the family entirely; they're just limiting direct contact with the baby for health reasons.\n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong. Their request is reasonable and based on health concerns. The family's reaction is over-the-top. So the answer should be B.\n"
