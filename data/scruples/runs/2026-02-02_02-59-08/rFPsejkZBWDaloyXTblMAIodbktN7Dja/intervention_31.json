We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. They sent a message explaining their reasons: avoiding overstimulation and flu concerns. The family took offense and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. 37 weeks is considered full term, but technically early by a few weeks. The parents are being cautious because of flu season. Their message was polite and explained the reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to exclude them from Christmas over this.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, protecting a newborn's health is a valid concern. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's health. The family's response is more about taking offense rather than understanding the health reasons. The initial message was clear and invited the family to come over, just not to pass the baby around. So the author's actions seem reasonable. The problem lies in the family's overreaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
