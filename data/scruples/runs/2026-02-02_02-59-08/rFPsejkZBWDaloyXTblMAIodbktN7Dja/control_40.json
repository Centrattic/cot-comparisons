We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a family not wanting to pass around their newborn, who was born at 37 weeks, early in the flu season. The author sent a message saying they wouldn't pass the baby around to avoid overstimulation and flu risk, and the family was offended, leading to a Christmas conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were reasonable. A 37-week baby is considered preterm, though close to full term. The parents' concerns about the flu season and overstimulation are valid medical reasons. Newborns, especially preemies, have underdeveloped immune systems and are more vulnerable to infections. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend limiting visitors around newborns, especially during flu season.\n\nThe author's message was polite and explained their reasons. They invited the family to come over and interact, just not pass the baby around. The family's reaction seems harsh. It's possible they felt excluded or that the parents were being elitist, but the parents had legitimate health concerns. The key here is whether the parents' decision was a reasonable precaution, which it is. The family's response of cutting off Christmas seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents are justified in protecting their vulnerable newborn, and the family's reaction was unreasonable.\n"
