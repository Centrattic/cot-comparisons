We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). The family got upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is considered full-term, right? Wait, full-term is usually 37-40 weeks. So technically, the baby isn't premature. But maybe the parents are being cautious because of the early birth, even if it's still within the full-term range. Also, it's flu season, so they might be worried about germs.\n\nThe parents sent a message explaining they don't want the baby passed around to avoid overstimulation and flu risks. The family took offense, leading to a Christmas conflict. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong.\n\nFrom a health perspective, protecting a newborn from illnesses is common. Even if the baby is full-term, their immune system is still developing. So the parents' decision makes sense medically. However, the family might have felt disrespected or not considered, thinking it's a slight. \n\nBut the parents did invite the family to come over and hang out, just not to pass the baby around. The message seems polite and explanatory. The family's reaction seems harsh. The parents are not being unreasonable; they're prioritizing the baby's health. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The parents have a valid reason, and the family overreacted.\n"
