      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who decided not to let their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early, during flu season. The family got upset and said they shouldn't come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention the baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered early but not extremely premature. They wanted to avoid over-stimulation and protect the baby from the flu. That sounds like a valid health concern. Flu season is a real risk for infants, and their immune systems are still developing. So, being cautious makes sense.\n\nHowever, the family's reaction was hurtful, telling them not to come to Christmas if they feel that way. On the surface, the parent's request seems reasonable. They're asking their family not to handle the baby, which might be a common practice in some families. But maybe there's a cultural expectation or a misunderstanding here. \n\nWait, the parent says they were \"passing him around,\" but they actually mean not passing him around. Maybe the wording was confusing. The parent wrote a text saying they won't be passing the baby around, but the family took offense. The key here is whether the parent's decision is within their rights as parents to protect their child's health versus the family's expectations.\n\nIn terms of medical advice, it's generally recommended to limit visitors around newborns, especially during flu season, for the first few weeks. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests avoiding contact with sick people and limiting visitors in the first few weeks. So, the parent's actions align with medical guidelines. \n\nThe family's reaction seems exaggerated. If they were genuinely concerned about flu transmission, they would support the parent's decision. Instead, they took it as a personal slight, which might indicate that the family's expectations clashed with the parent's need for caution. \n\nThe parent's text was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to come over and interact with the baby, just not in a passing-around way. The family's response of threatening to not come to Christmas seems disproportionate and hurtful. \n\nSo, the parent's actions were reasonable, and the family overreacted. The parent is not in the wrong for trying to protect their newborn's health. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
