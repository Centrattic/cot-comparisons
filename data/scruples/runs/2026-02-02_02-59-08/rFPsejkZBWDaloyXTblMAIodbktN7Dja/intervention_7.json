You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early term but still technically full term. The parents decided not to let the family pass around the baby during a Christmas gathering, citing concerns about overstimulation and the flu season.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is still considered full-term by some definitions, though it's a bit early. However, even a few weeks early can mean the baby is more vulnerable. The parents are worried about flu season and keeping the baby safe. From a health perspective, this seems reasonable. They might be protecting the baby from potential illnesses, which is a common parental concern, especially with newborns.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The parents communicated their decision in a polite way, explaining their reasons. They invited the family over to hang out but didn't want the baby passed around. However, this caused offense, leading to the family threatening to exclude them from Christmas. The parents might not have intended to offend, but they had a valid reason. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they made a decision based on health concerns and communicated it clearly. The family's reaction seems extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the parents were at fault. The parents have the right to set boundaries for their child's well-being. Newborns need protection, and flu season is a real concern. The key here is whether the parents acted unreasonably. Since they provided an explanation and still invited the family over, their approach seems considerate. The family's response of threatening exclusion is probably more about their own hurt feelings than the parents' actions being wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They made a reasonable decision for their baby's health and communicated it properly. The family's reaction is the issue here, not the parents' choice.\n"
