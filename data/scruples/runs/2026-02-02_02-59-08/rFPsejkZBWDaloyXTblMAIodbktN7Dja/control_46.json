You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their family to pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The situation involves a family gathering during flu season, and the author's text explaining their decision led to some family members feeling offended, even to the point of being told not to come to Christmas if they feel that way.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is about protecting the health of their newborn, especially since he was born slightly prematurely. Premature babies can have weaker immune systems, so exposure to flu viruses might be risky. The author wanted to avoid overstimulating the baby and keep him safe. Their message was clear and polite, explaining the reasons for their decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the family felt offended. The reaction of \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas\" seems harsh. It's possible the family members expected the usual interaction of holding the baby and didn't realize the health considerations. Maybe they didn't take the explanation seriously or felt it was an excuse to limit family time. Alternatively, there might be underlying tensions in the family that are being exacerbated by this situation.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a health and safety standpoint, the author's actions are reasonable. A 37-week baby isn't considered preterm but is still at higher risk compared to full-term. The flu season is a valid concern. The author's message was polite, explaining the reasons, which they did in advance. They didn't refuse the family from coming over but set boundaries. \n\nThe family's reaction seems to be the more questionable part. Reacting with an ultimatum about Christmas is extreme. It's possible they misinterpreted the message as a rejection rather than a health precaution. The author's actions don't appear to be inconsiderate; they provided a valid reason and allowed the family to visit. The issue might be more about the family's sensitivity than the author's overstepping.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or familial expectation of holding newborns at gatherings. In some families, not allowing that might be seen as a slight. But the author had a legitimate health concern, which should be respected. The key here is whether the author's decision was reasonable and communicated clearly, which it was. The family's reaction seems disproportionate, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
