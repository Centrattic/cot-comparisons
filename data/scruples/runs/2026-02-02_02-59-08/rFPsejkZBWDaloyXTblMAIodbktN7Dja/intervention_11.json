      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting family hold their newborn, who was born three weeks early (at 37 weeks). The family was upset and even mentioned not coming to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full term, but maybe some people might still consider it slightly premature. The parents are worried about the flu season and not wanting the baby overstimulated. They communicated this in advance with a message that's polite but firm. The family's reaction seems harsh\u2014threatening to not come to Christmas. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the parents' perspective: They're trying to protect their newborn. Even if 37 weeks is technically full term, doctors often advise caution with babies born even a few weeks early. Flu season is a real concern; newborns can't get the flu vaccine until 6 months and are at higher risk for complications. Overstimulation can affect a baby's sleep and stress levels, which is important for their development. The parents are setting boundaries, which is normal, especially for new parents who might be more anxious about their baby's health.\n\nFrom the family's perspective: They might feel slighted or not included. Maybe they have traditions where holding the baby is important. They might not understand the medical reasoning, especially if the baby is healthy. Their reaction could be over the top, but it's possible they felt disrespected or that the parents are being too controlling.\n\nBut are the parents in the wrong? The key points are communication and intent. The parents explained their reasons clearly and in advance. They're not refusing visitors; they're just not allowing holding the baby. The message is respectful and offers an alternative (visiting). The family's reaction is extreme. \n\nIn many cultures, new parents are expected to have some boundaries, especially regarding the health of the baby. The parents aren't doing anything harmful; they're taking precautions. The family's threat to skip Christmas over this seems disproportionate. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting in their baby's best interest with clear communication. The family's overreaction is their issue, not the parents'. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
