You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early. The family got offended and said they shouldn't come to Christmas if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The baby was born at 37 weeks, which is considered full-term, but maybe the parents are being cautious because flu season is a concern. They wanted to avoid over-stimulation and possible illness. They communicated this to the family, but the family reacted negatively, leading to the \"AITA\" question.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. Now, I need to decide if the author is wrong. \n\nFrom a medical standpoint, a baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term. However, some sources might say that 37-38 weeks is late preterm, which can still be at higher risk for certain issues. The parents' concern about flu season and not wanting the baby to be over-stimulated seems reasonable. Newborns, even full-term, need to be protected from germs and excessive handling.\n\nBut the family's reaction\u2014threatening not to come to Christmas\u2014seems harsh. The parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. They invited the family to hang out, just not pass the baby around. So the author's intention was to protect the baby's health, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, maybe the family felt slighted because they expected to hold the baby, and the parents' message made them feel unwelcome. Cultural factors might play a role here. In some families, holding the newborn is a big deal, and the refusal might be seen as a personal offense. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Protecting a newborn's health is important. The parents had a legitimate medical reason. The family's reaction is more about their feelings than the parents' actions. So the author isn't in the wrong for making a health-conscious decision. The family overreacted. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
