We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around.

We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the new parents decided not to let their family pass around their newborn, who was born three weeks early (37 weeks is considered full term, but a little early). They sent a message explaining they wanted to keep the baby safe from the flu and not overstimulate him. However, the family took offense and threatened not to come to Christmas if they don't pass the baby around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They just had a newborn, and it's flu season. They're likely concerned about the baby's health. Even though 37 weeks is technically full term, some babies born even a few weeks early might be more vulnerable. The parents probably wanted to be cautious. The message they sent was polite, explaining their reasons. They're not refusing to see the family, just not passing the baby around. It's about protecting the baby.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's reaction seems harsh. Threatening to not come to Christmas over not holding the baby is a bit extreme. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc., might feel hurt or like they're being excluded. They might not have considered the health risks or the baby's well-being. Maybe they didn't expect the parents to set boundaries, especially as new parents.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are: the message was clear and polite, they provided a reason (flu season, overstimulation), and they're not cutting off the family. The family's reaction is proportionate? Probably not. The parents are setting a reasonable boundary for their child's health. The family overreacting might be the ones in the wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
