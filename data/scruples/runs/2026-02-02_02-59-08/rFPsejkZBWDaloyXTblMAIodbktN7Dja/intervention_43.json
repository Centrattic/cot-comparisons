We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not letting their family pass around their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The author's reasoning is to avoid overstimulation and the flu during flu season. The family took offense and threatened not to come to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. A baby born at 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources might consider it \"early term.\" However, 37 weeks is just a week before the 40-week full term, so it's very close. The parents might be cautious, but maybe some family members don't realize that 37 weeks is almost full term, leading to misunderstanding.\n\nNext, the context of flu season is important. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to crowds can be risky. The parents are trying to protect their baby's health, which is a valid concern. However, the way they communicated this could be an issue. The message was friendly, starting with \"Merry Christmas,\" but maybe the family felt they were being excluded or that the baby was a burden. \n\nThe family's reaction of canceling Christmas seems extreme. But maybe the family felt hurt because they expected to hold the baby, which is a common tradition in many cultures. The parents might not have realized how much this meant to their family. Alternatively, the family might be overreacting, but the parents have a right to set boundaries for their child's health.\n\nIs the author wrong? On one hand, they have a legitimate reason to be cautious. On the other, maybe they didn't explain the medical reasoning clearly, leading to offense. If they had given more context or assured the family that they were welcome to be present but not hold the baby, perhaps the reaction would have been different. However, the parents are justified in wanting to protect their newborn, especially in flu season. The family's response is harsh, but the parents' action is about safety. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the reasoning is sound. Also, 37 weeks is close to full term, so maybe some people wouldn't consider it as risky as earlier preemies. But the parents are still within their rights to set boundaries. The key here is balancing health concerns with family expectations. The parents are not the asshole here because their primary concern is the baby's well-being.\n"
