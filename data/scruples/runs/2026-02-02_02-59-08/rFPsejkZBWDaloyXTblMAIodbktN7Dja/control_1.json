We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting family hold their newborn, who was born 37 weeks early. The family reacted strongly, threatening to exclude them from Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. 37 weeks is late preterm, and those babies can have health risks compared to full-term at 40 weeks. So the parents might have valid concerns about the baby's health, especially during flu season. It's common for parents to limit handling to protect the baby from illnesses or overstimulation.\n\nThe parents communicated their decision in advance, which is good. They didn't say no to visiting but set boundaries. The family's reaction seems harsh. Maybe they felt excluded or didn't understand the medical reasons. But the parents' main concern is the baby's well-being, which is a primary responsibility.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They made a reasonable decision for their child's safety and communicated it. The family overreacted. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
