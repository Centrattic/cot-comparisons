We just wanted to be safe, since it's flu season, so we let the family know we would be passing him around. Suddenly we had offended the entire family and we were told, \"If that's how you feel, then you should probably not come to Christmas.\" \n\nThe text that started it all:\nMerry Christmas everyone! We just wanted to let everyone know in advance that we aren't going to be passing (baby) around today. You guys are more than welcome to come over and hang out with the little dude, we just don't want him over-stimulated today, and we worry about the flu. We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing everyone!\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a newborn born at 37 weeks, which is considered early by some definitions. The parents decided not to let family pass around the baby, citing concerns about overstimulation and flu season. The family took offense and mentioned not inviting them to Christmas.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. A full-term pregnancy is typically 37-42 weeks. So 37 weeks is technically full-term, but some sources might consider it early term. However, the parents are concerned about health issues, which is a common precaution, especially during flu season. \n\nThe parents' message was polite, explaining their reasons. The family's reaction seems harsh. The author's intention was to protect the baby's health, which is a valid concern. However, the family might have felt excluded or hurt. The question is whether the parents overstepped.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a parent, you have the right to set boundaries for your child's health. Communicating that in a respectful way is appropriate. The family's response seems disproportionate. So the answer would likely be B (author not in wrong). The key points are the parents' right to make decisions for their child's well-being and the way they communicated it. The family's reaction is more about their feelings than the actual decision.\n"
