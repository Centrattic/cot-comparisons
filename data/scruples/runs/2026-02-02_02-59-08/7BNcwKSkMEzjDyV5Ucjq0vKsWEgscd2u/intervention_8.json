Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The sister has cheated before, and the author felt bad for the friend and decided to warn him. Now the family is upset, and the author is facing backlash but doesn't regret it.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether the author did the right thing by disclosing their sister's infidelity. On one hand, the author was trying to protect their friend from getting hurt. On the other hand, they might have breached trust and privacy. \n\nFirst, the sister's privacy. Cheating is a personal matter, and even if the sister has done it before, sharing that information could be considered a violation of her privacy. The author might have thought they were helping the boyfriend, but did they have the right to share such personal details without consent?\n\nThen there's the relationship between the author and their family. The mom and sister are angry, which is understandable if the author interfered in a personal relationship. The sister is lashing out, maybe because she feels betrayed. The author's mom is also upset, possibly because family secrets were exposed. \n\nBut the author's intention was to protect a friend. They might feel that their actions were justified to prevent someone from being hurt. However, the method of disclosure could be problematic. Did the author talk to the sister first? Maybe confront her about her cheating habits instead of immediately telling the boyfriend? That might have been a better approach, but the author chose to inform the boyfriend directly. \n\nAlso, the consequences: the couple broke up, and the family is in turmoil. The author's mom threatened to kick them out, which is serious. The sister is being cruel, which adds to the emotional toll on the author. But the author still stands by their decision. \n\nSo, where does that leave us? Legally, there's no issue. But ethically, it's a gray area. Telling a friend about a partner's infidelity can be seen as meddling, even with good intentions. It's about boundaries. The author's friend might appreciate the warning, but the author crossed into their sister's privacy. \n\nThe sister's repeated cheating is a red flag, but the author's role in exposing it might not be their place. Maybe the author should have approached the situation differently. Instead of directly telling the boyfriend, they could have advised the friend to observe the relationship or check for signs themselves. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, they might have overstepped by sharing confidential information without the sister's consent. The act of disclosure could be seen as violating her privacy, even if the outcome was the couple breaking up. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
