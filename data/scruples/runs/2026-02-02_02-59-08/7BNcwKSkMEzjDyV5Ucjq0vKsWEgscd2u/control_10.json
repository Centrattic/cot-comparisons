Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has cheated before, and the author, seeing a friend getting hurt, decided to warn the boyfriend. Now the sister and mom are upset, and the author feels they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the author is a sibling of the person who cheated. Siblings have a responsibility to each other, but there's also the issue of privacy and consent. The author didn't talk to the sister first; they went straight to the boyfriend. That might be a problem because the sister's actions are her business unless there's a reason to intervene.\n\nBut wait, the sister's cheating has a pattern. If the author knew she cheated on three other people, maybe they felt it was necessary to prevent harm. However, even with good intentions, does the author have the right to expose their sister's infidelity without her consent? That's a big question. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is a friend of the author. They might feel a duty to protect their friend from being hurt. But then again, maybe the boyfriend should have figured it out on his own. Or maybe the author crossed a line by not discussing it with their sister first.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is now being harsh, making fun of the author's weight and gynecomastia. The author might feel justified because they were trying to help a friend. But even if the sister is being mean, that doesn't necessarily mean the author was right to do it. \n\nLegally, maybe there's no issue, but in terms of family trust and relationships, the author probably overstepped. Siblings shouldn't expose each other's secrets without permission. Unless it's a matter of safety or serious harm, but in this case, it's more about protecting a friend, which is a personal choice.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help a friend, but the method was to breach their sister's privacy. Even if the sister is at fault for cheating, the author's action might have violated trust within the family. The sister and mom are upset because their privacy was invaded. The author didn't have the right to disclose that information without the sister's consent, regardless of their intentions. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they broke their sister's privacy. Even with good intentions, exposing someone's infidelity without their consent can be seen as a violation. The boyfriend had his own responsibility to address the relationship issues, and the author's intervention might have caused more family conflict than resolved the issue.\n"
