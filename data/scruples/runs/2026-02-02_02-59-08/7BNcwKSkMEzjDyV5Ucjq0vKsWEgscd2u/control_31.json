Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they should have told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has cheated before, and the author knew about it. The boyfriend is an old friend, so there's a personal connection. The author probably felt conflicted between loyalty to their sister and their friend.\n\nBy informing the boyfriend, the author is acting as a whistleblower. But is that justifiable? Cheating is a serious issue, and if someone is being harmed, maybe it's right to tell them. However, the author's sister might have a right to privacy. The fact that the author's sister is being angry and their mom is upset suggests that the family values the sister's privacy over the friend's well-being.\n\nAlso, the consequences are significant: the family is hostile, and the author is being criticized. The boyfriend was thankful but hurt, which is a mixed reaction. The author might have thought they were helping, but without the cheating partner's consent, sharing such information can be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nIn many cases, people are expected to keep their family's secrets unless there's a compelling reason to break them. The author's justification is that they didn't want to see a friend hurt. But the sister's actions are her responsibility. The author could have advised the boyfriend to confront her directly or seek counseling, instead of revealing the secret themselves. \n\nHowever, the sister's repeated cheating might make the author feel a sense of duty to protect others from being hurt again. But even so, without the victim's permission, disclosing such information can be legally and ethically problematic. There's a risk of being considered a stalker or interfering in someone else's relationship.\n\nSo, weighing the motivations and the consequences, the author's action might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if their intent was good. The family's reaction and the sister's specific vindictiveness (like making fun of the author's weight) indicate that the sister's privacy and the family's dynamics were more important here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's confidentiality, even with good intentions.\n"
