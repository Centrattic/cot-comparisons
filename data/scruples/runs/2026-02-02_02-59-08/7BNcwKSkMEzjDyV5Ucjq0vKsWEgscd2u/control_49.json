Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author decided to inform the boyfriend. The main points are:\n\n1. The sister is known to cheat, and the author wanted to protect a friend.\n2. The author took action by texting the boyfriend, leading to the breakup.\n3. The family is upset, especially the sister and mom, and the author is facing backlash.\n\nNow, legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, disclosing someone's infidelity isn't illegal, but it's a privacy issue. Ethically, it's more complex. The author's intention was to help the boyfriend, but did they have the right to do that without the sister's consent?\n\nConfidentiality and consent: The sister's private information was shared without her permission. Even if the sister's actions were wrong, the author became an informant without her knowledge. The author's role as a sister might imply some responsibility, but crossing into personal relationships can be tricky.\n\nPossible consequences: The author's actions led to a breakup and family conflict. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt. The family is now hostile towards the author. The sister's retaliation includes personal attacks, which might be a sign of her own guilt or anger.\n\nMoral judgment: Depending on cultural norms and personal values, some might see the author as a whistleblower, protecting a friend. Others might argue that it's not the author's place to interfere in another person's relationship, even if they suspect cheating.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they had to quit the film society club due to work, which might indicate they have their own stressors but don't regret the action.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respecting others' privacy is key. Even with good intentions, sharing sensitive information can have serious repercussions. However, if the sister's actions were harmful, some might argue the author had a duty to protect the boyfriend.\n\nBut since the author is a family member, the situation is complicated. The sister's privacy versus the boyfriend's right to know. The boyfriend was a friend, which might have influenced the author's decision to intervene.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention was to help, the action involved sharing private information without consent. Legally not wrong, but ethically debatable. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. However, typically in such \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the judgment can vary. If the sister was indeed cheating, some might side with the author. But others might say it's meddling. Given the context, the author might not be in the wrong (B), but there's a case for both sides. However, the standard answer for such scenarios often leans towards B if the action was to protect someone else and not malicious.\n"
