Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sister has a history of cheating, three times that they know of. The boyfriend here is an old friend of the author. The author felt compelled to tell him because they didn't want their friend to get hurt. The sister and mom are upset, even violent, and the author is dealing with the fallout.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, there's no wrongdoing because there's no law against sharing information about someone's infidelity. But morally and ethically, it's more complex. The author is a family member, so they might have felt a duty to protect their friend. However, revealing someone's cheating without their consent could violate privacy. The sister's privacy versus the boyfriend's right to know. \n\nIn relationships, cheating is a betrayal, but the sister might not have wanted her brother to expose her actions. The author's intentions were to help the boyfriend, but they took a side in a personal matter. Family dynamics are tricky here. The mother and sister's anger is understandable from their perspective, as the author didn't consult them and broke family trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was a friend to the author, and the author might have felt responsible to prevent further harm. The sister's cheating history is a pattern, so maybe the author thought this was necessary to protect their friend. But it's possible the author should have tried to talk to the sister first or involve other family members before taking action. \n\nThere's a balance between loyalty to family and protecting a friend. The author chose to side with the friend, which caused family conflict. Depending on cultural norms and personal ethics, the answer could vary. Some might say the author did the right thing to help a friend, others might think they overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy. \n\nThe key points are the sister's consent, the author's intentions, and the impact on both families. Since the author's actions led to a breakup but also saved the boyfriend from continued deceit, it's a tough call. However, without explicit consent from the sister, sharing such personal information could be seen as crossing a boundary. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they divulged private information without permission, even with good intentions. But others might argue it's justified to prevent harm.\n"
