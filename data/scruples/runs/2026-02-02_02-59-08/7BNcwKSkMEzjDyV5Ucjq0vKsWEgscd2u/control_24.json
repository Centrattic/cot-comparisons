Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The story is that the sister has a history of cheating, and the author, who used to be friends with the boyfriend, decided to text him the truth because they felt bad seeing their friend get hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Tattling or exposing someone's infidelity is a sensitive issue. On one hand, the author might have thought they were protecting their friend from further heartbreak. On the other hand, they breached their sister's privacy. \n\nThe sister's right to privacy is a big factor. Even if the sister's actions are considered wrong, the author had a duty to keep that information private unless there was a clear risk of harm. However, the boyfriend had a right to know if their partner was unfaithful. But was the author the right person to disclose that information? \n\nFamily dynamics complicate things. The author's mom and sister are upset, which could indicate that the author overstepped in a personal matter. Also, the sister's behavior is described as problematic, but the author's action might have led to family conflict. \n\nLegal aspects? Probably not, unless there's a privacy law involved. But the question is more about moral wrong. \n\nThe author's intent was to help a friend, which is understandable, but they might not have considered the consequences for their sister and their own family. The fact that the sister and mom are furious suggests that the author crossed a boundary. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a mix. The action might have been well-intentioned, but the method was questionable. The author didn't consult with their sister or other family members, which is part of the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they violated their sister's privacy and caused family discord, even if the intention was good. But there's a gray area here. The answer depends on whether the greater good of informing the boyfriend outweighs the breach of trust. However, typically, people are expected to handle such matters through the proper channels, like the cheating partner confronting their sister, not a third party. So the answer is A.\n"
