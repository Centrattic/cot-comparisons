Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of cheating, and the author found out about her current cheating incident. The author, being a friend of the boyfriend, decided to inform him. The main question is about the ethics of that action.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect their friend from getting hurt. They might argue that they were trying to do the right thing by preventing further emotional damage. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt, so maybe the author felt it was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister and mother are upset because the author broke confidentiality. The sister might feel her privacy was violated, and the mother is upset about family dynamics. The author's actions led to a family conflict, which is causing tension. \n\nBut here's the thing: the sister's actions were deceitful. Cheating is a serious betrayal, and the author might have felt that the boyfriend had a right to know. However, the author's role here is a sibling, which typically involves a duty of confidentiality unless there's harm involved. \n\nIs there a moral obligation to protect a partner from deceit? That's a tricky point. In some views, being honest in relationships is crucial, even if it means others might get hurt. The boyfriend was a friend, so the author's concern for his well-being could justify the action. \n\nBut then again, the author might have overstepped by not consulting the sister first. Siblings don't usually have the authority to expose each other's affairs without consent, even if those actions are wrong. So, there's a conflict between doing what's right for the friend and respecting the sister's privacy.\n\nThe consequences are significant: family estrangement, threats from the mother, and ongoing harassment from the sister. This shows that the author's action had a major impact. However, the author doesn't regret it, believing they prevented further harm.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. If the boyfriend had a right to know, then the author might be justified. But if the author didn't have the authority to disclose that information, they might be in the wrong. \n\nEthically, some might argue that the author acted out of a good intention but violated the sister's privacy. Others might see it as a necessary intervention to stop ongoing harm. It depends on cultural norms, family dynamics, and personal ethics.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might hinge on the balance between protecting a friend and respecting family member's privacy. The author's action had negative repercussions, but the intent was to prevent harm. The answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they aimed to protect their friend from betrayal, even if it caused family issues.\n"
