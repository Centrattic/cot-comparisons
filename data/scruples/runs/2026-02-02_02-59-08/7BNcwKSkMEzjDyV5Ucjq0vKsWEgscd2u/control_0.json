Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt it was their duty to protect their friend (the boyfriend). The family is upset, and there's a lot of tension now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, the author might have been trying to help their friend by preventing further harm. They saw a friend getting hurt and wanted to act. That's a valid concern. People in relationships deserve to know if they're being cheated on, so the author's intention was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't get their sister's permission to share that information. Privacy is a big deal. Even if the sister isn't a great person, the author might have overstepped by revealing personal information without her consent. The sister's right to privacy versus the boyfriend's right to know is tricky here.\n\nAlso, the consequences are significant. The relationship ended, and the author is now facing family backlash. The sister is being vindictive, which complicates things. But was it the author's place to intervene? If the sister's behavior was harmful, maybe the author should have approached it differently, like talking to the sister first or seeking family counseling instead of directly informing the boyfriend.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust within the family. The author's actions might have broken a trust that siblings have with each other. Even if the sister isn't trustworthy, the author might have violated that trust by going behind her back. The mother's reaction is extreme, but maybe the author's actions were seen as crossing a line.\n\nI should also think about whether the author had the right to disclose such personal information. Without consent, sharing someone's cheating might be considered a breach of confidentiality. The boyfriend was a friend, but the sister's privacy is another matter. The author's justification was to protect a friend, but maybe there were other ways to help without exposing the sister's actions.\n\nIn the end, while the author's intentions were to protect their friend, the method might be questionable. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and confidentiality. However, some might argue that the boyfriend had a right to know. But legally and ethically, sharing someone else's private information without consent is generally not advised. So, the answer might lean towards A, but there are arguments on both sides.\n"
