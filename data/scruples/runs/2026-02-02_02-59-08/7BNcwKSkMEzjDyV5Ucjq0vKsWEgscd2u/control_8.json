Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt compelled to inform the boyfriend to prevent him from getting hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by revealing the infidelity. The sister's privacy is a big aspect. Even if the sister has been unfaithful before, the author disclosing that information without consent might breach trust. Family dynamics are also important here\u2014maybe the author thought they were helping, but the sister and mom are upset. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue they were protecting a friend from getting hurt again. The boyfriend was a friend from the past, so there's a personal connection. The sister's repeated cheating suggests a pattern, and the author might feel responsible for intervening. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's right to privacy and the author's role in her life. Even if the sister's actions are problematic, the author isn't the boyfriend's authority to make decisions on her behalf. The fallout includes family conflict, with the mother threatening to kick the author out. That's a significant consequence. The author might not regret the action because they believed it was right, but others see it as betrayal.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations? There's no legal wrong here unless there's an invasion of privacy statute, but generally, sharing such information isn't illegal. Ethically, it's a gray area. While the intention was good, the method might have been wrong. The author could have tried to talk to their sister first or advised the boyfriend to address the issue himself, rather than spreading the information.\n\nThe sister's response being harsh, including name-calling and targeting the author's insecurities (weight, gynecomastia) complicates things. It shows the sister is defensive, but the author's action still has to be evaluated independently. \n\nIn relationships, trust is mutual. The sister's actions are wrong, but the author's disclosure without her consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. The boyfriend, being a friend of the author, might appreciate the heads-up, but the author didn't have the right to meddle in their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer depends on cultural and personal values. Some might see it as protecting a friend, others as violating family trust. But generally, intervening in someone else's relationship without permission can be seen as wrong, even with good intentions. So the author might be in the wrong.\n"
