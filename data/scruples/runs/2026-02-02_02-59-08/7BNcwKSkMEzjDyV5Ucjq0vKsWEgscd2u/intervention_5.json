Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author, who used to know the boyfriend, decided to inform him. Now, the sister and mom are upset, and the author is facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Tattling or intervening when someone is being cheated on is a gray area. On one hand, the boyfriend is being deceived, and the author might have a good intention to protect him. On the other hand, the author is breaking confidentiality between siblings. Did the author have the right to share that information without the sister's consent?\n\nThe sister's actions are clearly wrong, but the author's method of handling it could be questionable. Maybe there were other ways to help the boyfriend without directly exposing the sister. For example, they could have tried to talk to the sister first and convince her to be honest. But if the author felt that the boyfriend was being harmed and the sister wouldn't change, maybe their action was justified.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the relationship ended, and the family is upset. The author's mom threatened to kick them out, which is a serious fallout. Even though the dad stopped it, the family dynamics are tense. The sister's response, making fun of the author, is unkind, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of wrongdoing either. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally, it's about intent versus impact. The author's intent was to help the friend, but the impact caused family conflict. The question is whether the author overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy, even if her actions were wrong. \n\nIn many cases, family members have a duty to protect each other's privacy unless there's immediate harm. Since the author knew about the cheating, maybe they should have first approached the sister to address it, not the boyfriend. But if the sister was unresponsive or the author believed the boyfriend was in a harmful situation, the action might be seen as necessary despite the breach of trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about family loyalty and intervention. Some might say the author did the right thing to protect the boyfriend, others might say they should have handled it differently. But given the information, I think the author's action was a breach of trust with the sister, so they might be in the wrong. However, if the alternative is letting the boyfriend be deceived, maybe not. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy, even if the intent was good.\n"
