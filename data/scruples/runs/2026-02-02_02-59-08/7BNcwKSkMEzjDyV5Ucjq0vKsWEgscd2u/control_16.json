Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from different angles. The sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt compelled to protect their friend by revealing this. But there's also the issue of privacy and trust within the family.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they were protecting a friend from getting hurt. That's a noble intention, but did they have the right to disclose such personal information without consent? Family dynamics can be tricky here. The sister is upset because her privacy was violated, and the mother is also angry. The author is facing significant backlash, including being called names and threats of being kicked out.\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they did the right thing to save the relationship. But relationships are between two people, and the sister's actions are her responsibility to address. The author stepping in might have been seen as overstepping, especially without the sister's permission. \n\nAlso, the sister's history of cheating could imply a pattern, but that doesn't necessarily justify exposing her. The author could have considered other ways to support their friend, like encouraging him to confront his girlfriend or offering emotional support instead of directly revealing the infidelity.\n\nAnother point is the aftermath. The family's reaction is intense, which shows the breach of trust. The author is now facing personal attacks, which complicates things. Even though they don't regret the action, the consequences are severe. \n\nSo, the key issues here are privacy, consent, and the right to intervene in someone else's relationship. While the intention was good, the method might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for violating their sister's privacy without her consent, even if the motive was to prevent harm to the boyfriend.\n"
