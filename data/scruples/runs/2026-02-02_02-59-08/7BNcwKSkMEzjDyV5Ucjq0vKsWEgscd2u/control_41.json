Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the user told their sister's boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating on three previous boyfriends, and the current boyfriend is a friend of the user. The user felt it was the right thing to do to protect their friend, but now their sister and mom are upset, leading to family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the user overstepped. Telling someone that their partner is cheating is a big deal. Normally, people expect privacy in their relationships. Even if the sister is unfaithful, the user isn't in a position to act as a judge or a messenger. The boyfriend is the one who should confront his partner, not a third party. By revealing the infidelity, the user might have violated their sister's privacy and possibly ruined the relationship. However, the user's intention was to protect a friend from being hurt, which seems noble.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's actions are clearly wrong by cheating, but the user's method of addressing it might not be the right approach. The user didn't involve the sister first or maybe try to mediate. Instead, they directly told the boyfriend. That could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship without consent. The family's reaction is strong, which adds to the complexity. The user's actions have caused family discord, which is a significant consequence.\n\nBut then again, the boyfriend was a friend to the user, so maybe they felt responsible. However, relationships are private, and even if the user had good intentions, they might have been the ones at fault for not letting the boyfriend handle it himself. In many cases, people are expected to keep such information confidential unless they're in a position to be the one confronting the issue. The user isn't the boyfriend's partner, so they don't have the right to expose the infidelity. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's intention was good, but the action of revealing the cheating without the sister's knowledge or consent might be considered overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be that the user is in the wrong (A), but some might argue that they were protecting a friend (B). However, the key point is the violation of privacy and the sister's autonomy in her relationship. So leaning towards A.\n"
