Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. So, the sister has a history of cheating, and the author decided to inform the boyfriend. The family is upset, with the sister and mom being angry, and the author is facing some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Tattling on a family member's infidelity isn't a straightforward situation. On one hand, the boyfriend was being cheated on, which is hurtful. The author might feel that they were trying to protect their friend from getting hurt. On the other hand, the sister's privacy is a factor. Even if the sister is unfaithful, the author might have crossed a line by disclosing that information without her consent.\n\nThen there's the familial relationship. The author's actions caused a rift in the family. The mother and sister are upset, and the sister is being particularly cruel. The question is whether the author had the right to intervene in that relationship. Some might argue that the boyfriend had the right to know, but others might say that the author shouldn't have acted as a third-party to expose the infidelity without the sister's consent.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. They mention that they wanted to prevent the friend from getting hurt. That's a noble intention, but does that justify breaking confidentiality? In relationships, especially between siblings, there's an expectation of privacy. The sister might feel betrayed by the author's actions, even if her actions were wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. The relationship ended, and the family is in turmoil. The author might have thought they were helping, but the fallout is significant. It's a matter of whether the ends justify the means. Even if the sister was cheating, the author's decision to inform the boyfriend had repercussions that might have been avoided if the boy had discovered it on his own.\n\nLegal aspects aside, this is more about moral judgment. In many cultures, family members are expected to keep some things private. Intervening in a romantic relationship between another family member and a friend could be seen as overstepping. However, if the sister's behavior was harmful and the boyfriend was being deceived, there's an argument for the author trying to prevent further harm.\n\nBut the key issue is consent and the right to privacy. The author didn't get the sister's permission to disclose her infidelity. Even if the sister is unfaithful, the author's role as a sibling might not entitle them to act as a third-party messenger. The boyfriend should ideally discover such matters on his own or through the sister's own actions. The author might have saved the boyfriend pain in the short term but caused long-term family damage.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they violated their sister's privacy and the trust among family members. However, some might argue the opposite if they prioritize the boyfriend's right to know. But given the context and the aftermath, the consensus might lean towards A.\n"
