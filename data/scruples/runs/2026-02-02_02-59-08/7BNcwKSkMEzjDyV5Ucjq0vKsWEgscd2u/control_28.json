Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend she was cheating on him. The sister has a history of cheating, so maybe that's why they did it. But the question is whether they were wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Tattling on a sibling's affairs can be a tricky situation. On one hand, the person might have felt their friend was being hurt and wanted to protect him. On the other hand, they might have violated their sister's privacy. \n\nThe sister is described as someone who's cheated on multiple partners, so there's a pattern here. The author's intention was to prevent their friend from getting hurt again. But did they have the right to expose their sister? Maybe they should have talked to their sister first instead of directly telling the boyfriend. \n\nAlso, the mother and sister are upset, with the sister being particularly harsh. The author is facing backlash in their family. This could indicate that the action breached family trust. Even if the intention was good, sharing someone's private information without their consent can cause harm. \n\nBut then again, if the sister's behavior was hurting a friend, the author might feel justified. However, the boyfriend might have wanted to confront the issue himself or not at all. By telling him, the author took away his agency. \n\nAnother angle: was there a duty to keep their sister's secret? Family members often have a sense of loyalty, but that can conflict with protecting others. The author's justification is that they couldn't stand to see their friend hurt, which is understandable. \n\nBut legally and ethically, even if the sister was cheating, the author's disclosure without consent could be problematic. The sister has a right to privacy, and the author might have overstepped by revealing that information. \n\nIn terms of consequences, the breakup happened, and now there's family conflict. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the fallout suggests it's not universally accepted. \n\nSo, weighing the intention to protect the friend against the breach of trust and privacy, I think the author might be in the wrong. Even if the sister's actions were morally questionable, the author's method of handling it was poor. Maybe they should have encouraged the boyfriend to confront her himself or sought another way to help without direct intervention.\n"
