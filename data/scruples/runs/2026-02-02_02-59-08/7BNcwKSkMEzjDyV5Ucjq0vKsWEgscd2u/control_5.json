Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend that she's cheating. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of cheating, at least three times. The author, who used to know the boyfriend from a film club, found out about the infidelity and decided to text the boyfriend to warn him. The reasoning given is that they didn't want a friend to get hurt. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt, and the couple broke up. Now, the sister and mom are furious, even threatening the author, and the sister is being particularly harsh, making fun of the author's weight and gynecomastia. The author doesn't regret their actions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the sister's cheating is a pattern, so the boyfriend might have been in for a lot of hurt. The author might have been trying to prevent further harm. On the other hand, the author didn't have the sister's consent to share that information, which could be seen as a violation of her privacy. However, the sister's actions are deceitful, so maybe the author is justified in exposing the truth to protect a friend.\n\nBut there's a line between protecting someone and invading privacy. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're not in a position to act as a mediator. However, considering the sister's repeated cheating, the author might have had good intentions. The response from the family is harsh, but the author's intent was to help the boyfriend. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit grey. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of confidentiality, but they were trying to prevent harm. The sister's cheating is a major factor here. Depending on the cultural or familial norms, the answer might vary. In some views, the author did the right thing by protecting a friend, even if it meant exposing a family member's secrets. In others, it's about respecting family privacy regardless of the sister's actions.\n\nI think it's a balance between intent and the method. The intent was good, but the method might have been problematic. However, given the sister's repeated behavior, the author's action might be justifiable. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there are arguments for A as well.\n"
