Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about telling someone that their partner is cheating. The author's sister has a history of cheating, and the author felt the need to inform the boyfriend (who's also a friend of the author) about the infidelity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy. Siblings have a certain level of privacy, but there's also the aspect of protecting friends from being hurt. The author mentions that the sister is \"kind of a slut\" and has cheated on three partners. That's a pattern, which might suggest the sister has a recurring issue. The author's intention was to prevent a friend from getting hurt, which seems like a good motive. However, the action taken was to inform the boyfriend directly, which could breach the sister's confidentiality.\n\nNow, legally, there's no wrongdoing here, but morally and socially, it's more complex. Siblings might have a duty to protect each other, but if the sister is engaging in harmful behavior, maybe there's a point where stepping in is justified. But the author didn't confront the sister first; instead, they went straight to the boyfriend. That skips a step where the sister could have been held accountable or given a chance to address the behavior.\n\nThe author's mom and sister are upset because of the breach of privacy. The author is facing backlash at home, which is understandable. The sister's reaction includes personal attacks on the author's weight and gynecomastia, which is cruel and not justified, but the author's action might have caused that conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was thankful but hurt, which is a mixed result. The author's action might have saved the boyfriend from further emotional pain, but it's possible the boyfriend would have handled the situation differently if he had confronted the sister first.\n\nThe key factors here are consent, the author's role in the relationship, and the potential consequences. The author didn't ask the sister for her permission to share that information. Even if the sister's actions were wrong, the author didn't have the right to act as a mediator between the sister and the boyfriend. It's up to the sister to be honest with her partners, or for the boyfriend to notice the cheating himself. The author's intervention might have caused more harm than good, especially within the family dynamic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was a breach of privacy and possibly overstepping their role. Even with good intentions, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
