Her most recent bf is actually an old buddy of mine who i used to hang out with in the film society club (that i had to quit due to work). he's a chill dude so when i found out she was cheating on him i texted him and told him everything because it sucked to see a friend of mine get hurt like that. he was thankful but i could see he was massively hurt. \n\nthey have since broken up and both my sis AND my mom have been screaming at me and saying that i'm a piece of shit and my mom threatened to kick me out but thankfully my dad put a stop to that nonsense lol. still, my sis and mom are furious at me and it feels like im walking on eggshells at home. \n\nit sucks bad because they keep calling me all sorts of names and my sis in particular has been vicious making fun of my weight and my gynecomastia but i still don't regret telling him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of cheating on multiple boyfriends. The author found out she was cheating on her current boyfriend, who's a friend from their film society. They decided to text the boyfriend to warn him because they didn't want their friend to get hurt. The boyfriend was grateful but hurt, and they broke up. Now the sister and mom are angry, threatening to kick the author out, calling them names, and the author is still standing by their decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the sister's actions are wrong, but the author is her sibling. Did the author have the right to intervene? Well, the sister's cheating is a personal matter. The author might have thought they were helping the boyfriend, but sharing such private information without consent can be a breach of trust. The sister's privacy is a factor here. Even if the sister's actions are harmful, the author stepping in without her permission could be seen as a violation. However, the boyfriend has a right to know if he's being cheated on. The author's intention was to protect a friend, which is understandable. But maybe the author should have approached the sister first to address the issue instead of going straight to the boyfriend. Also, the fallout within the family is significant, with threats and emotional abuse. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was based on a good intention but might have overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy. However, the boyfriend has a right to know. It's a tough spot. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Legally, there's no law against this, but ethically, it's a gray area. The family's reaction is harsh, but the author's intent was to prevent harm. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to protect a friend, but they might have handled it differently. However, the main question is whether they are in the wrong. In many cases, people might disagree. Some would say the author protected a friend, others would say they invaded their sister's privacy. Since the user asks for A (wrong) or B (not wrong), I need to pick based on general consensus. I think it's a 50-50 split, but leaning towards B because the intention was good, even if the method was questionable.\n"
