I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions not to. She used handwritten signs with \"Do not Knock\" and also specified it in the delivery notes. But people kept knocking anyway. Then she switched to a sign with pictures of the courier logos to indicate where to leave packages. That worked well for packages, but last night they ordered dinner and the delivery person left it at the front door instead of calling, and the food was cold. The author is upset, her husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo the main points are: she tried multiple ways to prevent knocking, which worked for packages but not for food. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction but left the food outside, which was inappropriate for hot food. She's frustrated because the delivery person didn't use common sense. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to prevent knocking, which is reasonable. She had specific instructions for packages. But when it came to food, the sign might have been misinterpreted. The sign with logos probably indicated where to leave packages, not how to handle food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign's literal instruction but didn't consider that food should be handed over. The author expected common sense, but maybe the sign was too generic. However, she did specify \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes. The problem is the sign's design might not have been clear enough for different types of deliveries. The author might be in the wrong because the sign could have been confusing for food deliveries, and she didn't account for the difference between packages and hot food. But on the other hand, the delivery person should have recognized that food isn't a package. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the author's instructions were too vague for different contexts. So I think the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong because her sign might not have been appropriate for food deliveries, leading to the cold food issue.\n"
