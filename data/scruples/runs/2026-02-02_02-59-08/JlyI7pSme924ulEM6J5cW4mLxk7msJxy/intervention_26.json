I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The author is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking despite her signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" She even took steps to make a specific sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but backfired with a food delivery that was left outside and got cold.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sign's intent. The author's goal was to prevent people from knocking because she's a new mom, maybe dealing with a baby who might be disturbed by knocks. She went to the trouble of creating a sign with courier logos to make it clear. However, when a food delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left the food without knocking, it resulted in a cold meal. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nThe question is whether the sign's instructions were valid and if the author is at fault. On one hand, the sign is clear and was effective with other deliveries, so the food deliverer followed it. On the other hand, food deliveries typically require confirmation that someone is home, hence the knock. If the delivery person didn't knock, maybe they assumed no one was there, leading to the food being left outside. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the sign's explicit instruction might have overridden that. So, maybe the author set up conflicting instructions\u2014saying not to knock but expecting the delivery person to know when to knock. Therefore, she might be in the wrong because she didn't consider that food delivery might need a different approach than packages. The answer would be A.\n"
