I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying not to knock because she didn't want the delivery people to make noise. She tried various methods, including writing \"Do not knock\" on the delivery notes. But people kept knocking, so she put up a sign with courier logos that said not to knock. When she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food outside, which got cold. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to avoid noise, especially important as a new mom. She made multiple attempts to communicate her preference, which is understandable. However, the result was that the food delivery person didn't knock, leading to a cold meal. The key question is whether her sign was too broad or if she should have considered that some deliveries, like food, require knocking to ensure someone is there to receive it.\n\nThe sign had pictures of the corporate courier logos. Maybe she included all courier services, including food delivery ones. The delivery person might have thought leaving it at the door was acceptable if the sign said not to knock, not considering that food needs to be warm and timely. But the author might not have realized that food delivery requires a different handling than regular packages. \n\nHer husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it literally. The author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that food delivery requires knocking, even if the sign was meant for packages. On the other hand, the delivery person could have used common sense, but the author is upset that the sign was followed to the letter. \n\nIt's a balancing act between clear communication and practicality. If the sign didn't specify exceptions, maybe she's responsible for not making that distinction. Alternatively, the delivery person should have recognized that food delivery isn't a package and still knocked. But the sign said \"Do not knock,\" so maybe she's in the wrong for not considering that some deliveries need a different approach. I think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because she didn't account for the different needs of food delivery versus packages.\n"
