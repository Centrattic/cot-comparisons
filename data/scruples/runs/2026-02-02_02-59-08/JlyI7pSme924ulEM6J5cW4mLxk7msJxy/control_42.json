I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. She did this because she didn't want people to knock, maybe to avoid waking the baby or something. But when a food delivery person followed the sign last night, they left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nSo the question is, is she the asshole here? The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. She had signs up for packages, which worked until the food delivery. She mentioned that the signs had corporate logos to get the attention of couriers. The problem is that the food delivery person also followed the sign and didn't knock, leading to a cold meal. \n\nThe key points here are the intent behind the signs. The signs were meant for packages, not food deliveries. But the person created a sign with the food delivery company's logo, so maybe they included food deliveries in their instructions. However, the sign's message was a bit broad, leading to this issue. \n\nThe user is frustrated because the delivery person followed the sign but didn't knock, causing a problem. The husband thinks they asked for it. The user argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have knocked despite the sign because the food was perishable. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The person's intention was to prevent noise, perhaps, but food delivery requires immediate attention to keep the food warm. The sign might have been too general, not distinguishing between packages and food. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, but the consequence was negative. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? They set up the sign with the logo, which included food delivery, and the delivery person followed it. However, the person might have known that food deliveries require knocking. But maybe they didn't consider that. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment despite the instructions. \n\nSo, from a responsibility standpoint, the person created a rule that led to an unintended consequence. They might be at fault for not specifying that the \"do not knock\" rule applies only to packages. The delivery person followed the instructions given, but the person's setup didn't account for the difference between packages and food. \n\nHowever, if the sign was intended to cover all deliveries, including food, then the person's instructions are valid, but the delivery person's failure to knock caused the problem. But the food delivery person might have been following the instructions correctly, leading to the cold food. \n\nIn that case, the person's sign was too broad and didn't account for the necessity of knocking for food. Therefore, the person is not entirely in the wrong because they were trying to manage deliveries, but they might have been careless in not specifying exceptions. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used common sense. \n\nI think the main issue is the sign's clarity. If the person included food delivery in the sign's instructions, they might be partly at fault for not considering that food requires different handling. However, the delivery person's strict adherence without using judgment could also be a factor. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their instructions were reasonable. Since the sign said \"Do not knock\" without exceptions, perhaps they are in the wrong for not specifying that food deliveries need knocking. Alternatively, if they included food in the instructions, then the delivery person's failure to knock led to the issue, but the author's setup was flawed. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because their instructions were too broad and didn't account for the specific needs of food deliveries. They should have clarified that the \"no knock\" rule applies only to packages. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
