I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking when leaving packages. They tried various methods, and eventually used a sign with courier logos which worked for packages. Then, they ordered dinner, and the delivery driver didn't knock, left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband says they asked for it, and the author is questioning if she's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was trying to prevent knocking, which is understandable, maybe to avoid disturbing a baby or because she was busy. She made clear signs, even using specific courier logos. When the food delivery came, maybe the driver didn't realize that the sign applied to food deliveries as well. The sign had the logos of the couriers, so if the food delivery company was one of them, the driver might have followed the sign's instruction. The problem is that the food was left outside and got cold. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? She intended to prevent knocking, but the consequence was a cold meal. She might not have considered that food deliveries are different from packages\u2014cold food needs to be handled quickly, and not knocking could lead to that. The signs were for packages, maybe not for food. The author didn't specify that the sign was for packages only, so the driver might have followed it regardless. So, maybe the author didn't consider the different types of deliveries. \n\nOn the other hand, the driver's job is to deliver food, which is time-sensitive. Even if the sign said not to knock, the driver should have found another way to ensure the food was delivered properly, like leaving a note or contacting the customer. But the driver left it unattended, which is not ideal. However, the author's sign might have misled the driver into thinking it was okay to leave it without knocking. \n\nI think the author's intention was reasonable, but she didn't account for the fact that food deliveries require different handling. The sign might have been too broad. Maybe she should have specified that the no-knocking rule applies only to packages. So, in that sense, she might be partially at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. However, the driver also has a responsibility to handle food deliveries properly. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she set clear instructions that were followed, leading to an unintended consequence, does that make her the asshole? The community usually looks for whether the person acted unreasonably or without considering others' needs. In this case, the author's main concern was to avoid being disturbed, which is valid, especially as a new mom. However, the food delivery is a service that requires timely handling. \n\nThe answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because her intention was to reduce disturbances, but she could have been more specific. However, the way the sign was interpreted by the driver led to a problem. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable. Since she tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock\" and the sign worked well for packages, perhaps she didn't realize the sign's effect on food deliveries. The driver's responsibility is to ensure the food is delivered properly, which they failed to do. So maybe the driver is more at fault here. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the sign was clear and the driver followed it, leading to a cold meal, the author might be seen as the one who set the rule that caused the problem. The husband's comment that they asked for it suggests that. However, the author might not have intended for food to be left unattended. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the sign was misinterpreted. If the sign was specific to packages, the author isn't wrong. But if it was general, then maybe she is. The sign had courier logos, so it's possible it was intended for all deliveries. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not making the sign's scope clear. However, the driver's job is to handle food properly, so maybe the driver is also at fault. \n\nIn the end, the community might say the author is not in the wrong because her intention was reasonable, but the sign's ambiguity led to the issue. The driver should have used better judgment. Alternatively, the author could be seen as not considering the different needs of food vs. packages. \n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the main issue is the sign's clarity and the driver's handling, not the author's intention. But I'm a bit conflicted because the sign did work as intended for packages, and the food delivery was an unintended consequence. The author's mistake was not specifying the sign's application, but that's a minor oversight. The driver's failure to handle the food properly is more of an issue.\n"
