I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a new mom dealing with a lot of package deliveries. They had signs that said \"Do not Knock\" to prevent deliveries from knocking on the door, probably because they're busy with a baby and don't want the interruption. They tried writing this note in the delivery instructions multiple times, but it didn't work. So they created a more prominent sign with courier logos, which worked in the sense that the delivery person didn't knock. But then, when they ordered dinner, the food was left at the door and got cold because the delivery person didn't wait or knock to inform them. The author is upset because the food was cold, and her husband says they were asking for it. She thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were reasonable. They wanted to avoid being knocked on, which is understandable, especially with a new baby. But maybe the solution they chose was too strict. The sign might have been clear that they don't want any knocking, even for food deliveries. However, food deliveries are time-sensitive, and the delivery person might have expected to knock or call because it's different from a regular package. The author might have not considered that leaving perishable items like food without any contact could lead to issues. On the other hand, the delivery person should maybe have used judgment to check if the customer was home in a way that didn't involve knocking, like using a doorbell or messaging app if available. But the sign explicitly said \"Do not Knock,\" so the delivery person might have followed instructions literally without considering the perishable nature of the item. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's instructions were reasonable. They had a valid reason for not wanting to be disturbed, but perhaps they should have made an exception for food. Maybe the sign should have specified that packages can be left without knocking, but food orders require a knock. Since they didn't, the delivery person followed the sign exactly, leading to the cold food. The author's mistake might be not clarifying the exception for food deliveries. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for the different handling required for perishable items, making the answer A.\n"
