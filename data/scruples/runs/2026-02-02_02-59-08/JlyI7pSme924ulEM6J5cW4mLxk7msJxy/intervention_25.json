I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who has been getting packages delivered and kept asking the deliverers not to knock. She put up signs with \"Do not Knock\" and also used the notes in the delivery options. But the deliverers kept knocking. Then she put up a different sign with the courier logos, which worked for the packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, causing the food to be cold. Now she's upset, and her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's main issue was that delivery people kept knocking despite her instructions. She tried multiple ways to communicate \"Don't knock,\" including written signs and delivery notes. When she used a different sign with pictures (maybe the courier logos as a visual cue), it worked for packages, but when a food delivery person saw it and followed it, the food was left at the door and got cold. \n\nThe key here is whether her sign was clear enough to differentiate between packages and food deliveries. The sign might have been intended for courier services like UPS or FedEx, not for food delivery services like DoorDash or Uber Eats. If the food delivery person saw the sign and assumed they should follow the same rule, they left the food outside. But the author probably expects food deliveries to be handled differently\u2014maybe left at the door if no one's there, but food is time-sensitive and should be given to someone. \n\nThe problem is that the sign might not have been specific enough. It's possible that the sign's instructions were meant for package deliveries only, not food. However, the delivery person might not have realized that. The author's intent was to prevent knocking, which worked, but the consequence was that the food was left out and became cold. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? From a communication standpoint, maybe she should have specified that the \"Do not knock\" instruction applies to packages and not to food deliveries. But she didn't, and the delivery person followed the sign as written. On the other hand, common sense would dictate that food deliveries need to be handled differently\u2014perhaps the delivery person should have used judgment and left a note, or tried to contact the recipient. \n\nBut the delivery person might not have the time or protocol to check for special instructions beyond what's on the sign. If the sign said \"Do not knock,\" they might not knock, which is exactly what the author wanted, but it's not their fault the sign didn't differentiate between types of deliveries. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be at fault for not making the sign clear enough. Maybe she should have included something like \"For courier packages only\" or \"Do not knock for packages, but contact if food delivery.\" \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. The author wanted to prevent knocking, which succeeded, but the unintended consequence was a cold meal. The sign's instructions were followed as written, so the delivery person isn't necessarily at fault. The author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that the sign's instructions could apply to food deliveries too. However, the delivery person could also be expected to use common sense for time-sensitive food. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sign was unambiguous. If it was meant for packages only, and the delivery person misinterpreted it for food, the author might have a responsibility to clarify. But if the sign wasn't specific, then maybe she's at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. But I'm not entirely sure. The sign's design might be part of the issue. The image isn't visible, but the link is to a gallery with courier logos. Maybe the sign listed specific couriers, so the food delivery person didn't recognize their logo and followed the rule. In that case, the author didn't specify that the rule applies only to certain couriers. So the author's instructions were too broad. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
