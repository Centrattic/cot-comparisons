I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she gets a lot of packages. The signs were ignored, so she got a more noticeable sign with corporate logos, which worked. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the front door, which was ice cold when they realized. The husband thinks they asked for it, and the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the intent and the outcome. The author wanted to prevent knocking for packages, which they had a problem with. They tried multiple signs, and the latest one worked. However, this time it was for food, which needs to be handled differently. The sign's message was to not knock, but food delivery typically requires knocking to ensure the food doesn't get cold. The sign might have been too literal, not considering different types of deliveries.\n\nThe author's intention was reasonable to avoid noise, but maybe the sign didn't account for different delivery types. The delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to a problem. So the author might have been too rigid, not considering that different deliveries require different handling. The husband's point is that they asked for it by having the sign, but the author argues common sense should have been used. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. They tried to communicate their preference, but maybe didn't consider exceptions. However, the delivery person might have been following instructions to the letter without discernment. The sign might not have been clear enough to differentiate between packages and food. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have specified in their delivery notes for food orders. Since they mentioned using delivery options notes before, maybe they didn't for this food order. So maybe both sides have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sign was too generic, leading to unintended consequences, then maybe the author shares some blame. \n\nBut the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but is curious. The answer options are A or B. Considering that the author's sign was effective but didn't account for different delivery types, leading to a problem, I might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider that not all deliveries should be handled the same. However, the delivery person also should use some common sense. But the question is about the author's responsibility. Maybe the sign was too broad, so the author is partially at fault. So answer A.\n"
