I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around a new mom who put up signs and notes asking delivery people not to knock. Initially, the signs were ignored, so she used a more explicit sign with courier logos, which worked. Then, when ordering food, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to prevent knocking, which she achieved with the new sign. However, the consequence was that the food delivery wasn't properly handled. The key points here are the expectations set by the sign and the delivery person's actions. The sign might have been interpreted as a blanket instruction not to knock for any delivery, including food. The delivery person followed the sign literally, assuming they shouldn't knock, so they just left it at the door. But the author expected that the delivery person would use common sense to knock for food, even if the sign said not to. \n\nThe author did mention in checkout notes to not knock for packages, but maybe didn't specify that food deliveries are an exception. The sign's effectiveness in stopping knocking for packages could have led the delivery person to apply the same rule to food. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" implies that the author's instructions were too broad. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not clarifying that the no-knocking rule applies only to packages, not food. By using a sign that includes all couriers, the delivery person might not have known the distinction. Therefore, the author's lack of specificity could be the issue. The delivery person followed the instructions as given, which were ambiguous. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for not making the exception clear.\n"
