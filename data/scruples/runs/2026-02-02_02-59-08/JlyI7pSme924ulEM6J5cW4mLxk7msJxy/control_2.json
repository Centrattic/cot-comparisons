I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a new mom who receives a lot of packages. She's been putting up signs that say \"Do not Knock\" but the delivery people kept ignoring them. So she made a new sign with the courier logos, which worked in terms of deliveries not being knocked. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door instead of knocking, and the food got ice cold.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She's asking if expecting the delivery person to knock for food is unreasonable. The sign was intended to stop package deliveries from being knocked on the door, but food delivery is different. The key here is that the sign with the courier logos might have been interpreted as applying to all deliveries, including food. However, food delivery usually requires a knock or call because the recipient isn't expecting a package and needs to be alerted immediately to keep the food hot and safe. \n\nShe did specify \"Do not Knock\" in delivery notes, but maybe the sign was more visual and didn't differentiate between packages and food. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions but caused a problem with the food. She might be at fault for not making it clear that the sign applied only to packages, not food. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used common sense to determine that food isn't a package and needs to be handed over. \n\nBut the user's husband said they were asking for it, implying that the sign was too broad. The user argues common sense should prevail. I think the main issue is that the sign was ambiguous. If she wanted packages left without knocking but food delivered with a knock, the sign didn't specify that. So she might be in the wrong for not clarifying. Alternatively, the delivery person should have known the difference. But the sign was effective for packages, so maybe the user didn't consider that food is a different service. Hmm. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she was trying to follow their own instructions, but the delivery person should have used judgment. But the sign's effectiveness on packages suggests she wanted all deliveries left without knock, which might not be reasonable for food. So maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because the sign didn't differentiate and she should have considered that food delivery requires a knock. But some might argue it's the delivery person's fault. I'm leaning towards A because the sign was too broad and she didn't make exceptions for food.\n"
