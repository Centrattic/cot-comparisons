I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent loud knocks when deliveries are made. She had previous issues where the instructions were ignored, so she got a sign with logos that worked. But then, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold. The author is upset about the delay and the food being cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to reduce noise, which makes sense, especially for a new mom who might be sensitive to loud knocks. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not Knock\" through notes and signs. When the sign with logos worked, it's possible that the delivery people were following the visual cue correctly, but in this case, maybe they misinterpreted it. The food being left outside got cold, so the author is upset because they expected the delivery person to exercise common sense and not leave a perishable item outside.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions literally. The sign said not to knock, but maybe didn't specify what to do in cases of food delivery. The delivery person might have assumed that leaving it at the door was acceptable since there was no knock, and they didn't have another delivery option. The author might have expected the delivery person to use judgment beyond the written instructions, but perhaps the instructions weren't clear enough.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't specify that food should be heated or kept warm, then maybe the delivery person isn't responsible for that. However, the author did expect that the delivery person would understand that food needs to be handled properly. The problem here is that the sign was effective in stopping knocks but didn't address food delivery specifics.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in not providing clear instructions for different types of deliveries. She focused on \"Do not Knock\" but didn't account for the nuances of food delivery. The delivery person followed the instruction literally, leading to an unintended consequence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't communicate all necessary details, leading to the cold food situation. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense, but maybe that's expecting too much if the instructions were explicit.\n"
