I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages delivered. They put up signs saying \"Do not Knock,\" both handwritten and in the delivery notes, but people kept knocking. Then they found a sign with company logos, and that worked for packages. But when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it was cold. The husband says they were asking for it, and the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the author's sign was reasonable. The sign had pictures of courier logos, which might have been intended for package deliveries, not food. The food delivery person might have been confused because the sign was about packages, not food. The author expected the delivery person to use judgment, but maybe the sign was too broad. They had previously specified \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes, but that wasn't followed. Now, with the sign, maybe they didn't account for different types of deliveries. The delivery person left the food outside, which was inappropriate, but the sign might have been misinterpreted. The author might have been too strict, not considering that food needs to be handled differently. So maybe the author is at least partially responsible for not making the sign specific enough. But then again, the delivery person should have used common sense. It's a bit of a toss-up. The options are A or B. I think the author is in the wrong because their sign might have been too general, leading to the wrong action. So answer A.\n"
