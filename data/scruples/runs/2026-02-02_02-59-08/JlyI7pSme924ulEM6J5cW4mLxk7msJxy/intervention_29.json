I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a new mom who has been getting a lot of packages. She's put up signs and written notes on orders saying \"Do not knock\" because she doesn't want the deliveries to disturb her or her baby. The problem is that the delivery people kept ignoring those instructions, so she put up a bigger sign with corporate logos to get them to leave packages without knocking. That worked for packages, but when they ordered food delivery, the same delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. She expected the delivery person to follow the same instructions as the package couriers, but food delivery usually requires knocking to ensure the food is passed directly to the recipient. The sign was meant for packages, not food. She didn't specify different instructions for food. So maybe she assumed the same rules applied to food, which might not be reasonable. Food delivery often needs a person to take it immediately to keep it warm. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which led to a cold meal. The husband's comment suggests that maybe the sign was too broad. The author might have been too rigid by not making exceptions for food. So, maybe she's in the wrong because she didn't account for the difference between packages and food. Answer A.\n"
