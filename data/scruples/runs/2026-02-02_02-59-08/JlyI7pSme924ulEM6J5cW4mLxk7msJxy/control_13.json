I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's had issues with delivery people ignoring her \"Do not Knock\" instructions. She tried various signs and notes, but nothing worked until she used a sign with corporate logos. The sign worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, resulting in a cold meal. The husband says they asked for it, and she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. She wanted to prevent knocking, which she's done with signs and notes. The sign worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The person's main request was not to knock, which the delivery person respected by not knocking and leaving it outside. However, the problem is the food getting cold. The key here is whether the author's sign led to an unintended consequence, but was her primary instruction followed?\n\nThe husband's comment suggests he thinks they were responsible for the sign's outcome. However, the author's intent was to stop knocking, not to ensure food temperature. The delivery person followed the instruction, albeit causing a side effect. The question is if the author should have foreseen that food delivery might require a different handling. But since the sign was general and not specific to food, maybe she isn't at fault. The delivery person might have interpreted the sign strictly and didn't consider the perishable nature of food. \n\nThe author took reasonable steps to communicate her preference. The delivery person adhered to the instruction, leading to an unintended problem. The husband's reaction is harsh because the main instruction was followed. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong; she's dealing with a situation where her instructions worked but had a side effect. The delivery service might need better communication between customers and deliverers, but the author's actions don't make her the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
