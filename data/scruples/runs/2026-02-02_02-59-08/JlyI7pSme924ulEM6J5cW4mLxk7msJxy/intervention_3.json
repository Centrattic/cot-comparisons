I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which were ignored. So she changed to a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door even though it was cold. The author is upset that the food wasn't knocked for, leading to it being cold. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the author's problem is that the previous signs for packages were ineffective, so she used a different sign that worked. But food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left safely, but food is time-sensitive. The sign might have been intended for packages, not food. The delivery person might not have realized it was food. The author expects the deliverer to use judgment, but the sign didn't specify. So maybe the author didn't make it clear that the \"Do not knock\" applies to packages only. Alternatively, the deliverer should have known better than to leave cold food outside. \n\nThe key points: The sign was effective for packages but not for food. The author expected the deliverer to knock for food. The deliverer didn't, leading to a problem. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting that. \n\nIf the sign was meant for packages only, maybe the author didn't communicate that clearly. But if the sign was general, maybe the deliverer assumed it applied to all deliveries. The author might be in the wrong for not specifying. Alternatively, the deliverer should have used common sense to realize that food needs to be handed over. \n\nConsidering that the author had multiple signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and the deliverer ignored them, maybe the problem is that the sign was too vague. The author might have been wrong to expect the deliverer to differentiate between packages and food without explicit instructions. Or maybe the deliverer was wrong to not use judgment despite the sign. \n\nThe husband's point is that they were asking for it, implying the author's own signs caused the issue. The author argues that common sense should be applied. So, is the author wrong for expecting the deliverer to knock for food, even with the sign? If the sign was for packages, maybe the author should have made an exception for food. But if the sign was general, the deliverer might have followed it regardless. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author is not entirely wrong because food delivery is different, but she might have failed to communicate that the \"Do not Knock\" was only for packages. So the answer could be A or B depending on that. But I think the key is that the author didn't make it clear that the sign didn't apply to food. Therefore, she's in the wrong for not specifying, making the answer A.\n"
