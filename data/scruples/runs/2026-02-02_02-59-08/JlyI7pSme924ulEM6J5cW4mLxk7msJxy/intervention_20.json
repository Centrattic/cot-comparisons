I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation involves a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking despite clear instructions not to. She put up a sign that worked for packages but didn't for a food delivery, leading to the food being left outside and getting cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent noise and disruption for her baby by not having people knock. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and signs. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was meant for packages, but that caused the food to be left outside when it probably needed to be handed over directly.\n\nThe key point here is whether the sign was specific enough to differentiate between package delivery and food delivery. The sign had corporate logos, possibly implying it's for delivery services in general. The author expected the deliverer to use common sense and realize that food shouldn't be left outside, but the deliverer just followed the sign literally.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she was trying to protect her baby from noise. However, by not specifying that the \"Do not knock\" rule only applied to packages and not to food deliveries, she might have caused confusion. The deliverer followed the instructions as given, which were to not knock, leading to an unintended consequence. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that maybe the solution was too broad. The author's request for the deliverer to use common sense might be reasonable, but the deliverer might not be expected to read into the instructions beyond what's written. \n\nSo, while the author had a valid reason for not wanting to be knocked on the door, the sign didn't clearly specify exceptions for food deliveries. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not communicating the nuance properly. The deliverer did what was instructed, even though it led to a problem. Hence, the author is partially at fault for not clarifying the different delivery types.\n"
