I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she got a sign with logos that worked, but now when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, which got cold. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was trying to prevent delivery people from knocking since she's a new mom and maybe doesn't want disturbances. She used signs both handwritten and corporate ones. The corporate sign worked for packages, but when a food delivery happened, the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside, leading to cold food. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the key points are: the signs were effective for packages but not for food deliveries. The problem here is that food deliveries might require a different handling than regular packages. For food, it's usually expected that the delivery person would knock or call to ensure the food is warm and to get a signature or confirmation. Packages can be left at the door, but food is perishable and needs immediate attention.\n\nThe author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, which she did by using the sign. However, the food delivery person followed the same sign's instruction, leading to a negative outcome. The question is whether the author's setup was too broad. By using a sign with corporate logos, might she have included food delivery services as well? If yes, then she might be at fault for not differentiating between package deliveries and food deliveries.\n\nBut she did mention that the sign was for \"packages\" in her previous notes. She might have thought the sign was only for packages, but the food delivery person didn't check the context and followed the sign's instruction regardless. The author might not have considered that the sign's instruction could apply to all deliveries, including food. So, maybe she's in the wrong for not being specific enough.\n\nHowever, another angle is that food delivery services have different handling expectations. Even if the sign said not to knock, the delivery person should use common sense and knock anyway for food. But the author's husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign's instructions were followed correctly. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because she didn't account for the difference between package deliveries and food orders. The sign was effective for packages but not appropriate for food. She should have used a more specific sign for packages only. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
