I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for package deliveries. The delivery people kept ignoring it, so she used a sign with courier logos that worked, but then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to cold food. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author tried multiple times to communicate not to knock\u2014handwritten signs, checkout notes. It didn't work, so she used a more effective visual sign. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left the food at the door without knocking. The problem is the food was cold because they didn't knock and wait for someone to answer.\n\nNow, why would the author be in the wrong? Well, maybe because she changed her approach. The original instruction was \"Do not knock,\" which the delivery people ignored. But then she used a sign that worked, but perhaps the delivery person misinterpreted it. The sign might have been for packages, not food deliveries. The author might have not considered that different delivery types might have different handling needs. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but that led to an unintended consequence (cold food) because they didn't knock. So maybe the author didn't account for the different use cases of the sign.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had legitimate reasons\u2014being a new mom, maybe needing to keep the door closed for safety or to keep out the cold with the baby. She tried to communicate clearly but the delivery people didn't follow. The sign worked for packages but caused an issue with food. The husband says they asked for it, implying that the author's sign was clear and the delivery person followed it, so the problem is on the user's side. However, the author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food delivery requires knocking.\n\nSo the key points are: the author tried to communicate no knocking, the delivery person followed the sign, but the context was different (food vs. packages). The author may have not considered that food deliveries might require a different instruction. The delivery person's action was technically following the sign, but maybe the sign was too broad. The author's mistake was using a sign intended for packages on a food delivery, where knocking would be necessary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she applied the same rule to a different type of delivery without considering the necessary adjustments. The delivery person followed the instruction, but the result was the user's fault for not differentiating between package and food deliveries.\n"
