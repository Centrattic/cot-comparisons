I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages because she doesn't want delivery people to knock. She tried various ways to communicate this, including notes on the sign and in delivery instructions. The sign worked for packages but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which was ice cold when they noticed. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The key points are that she wanted no knocking, which was effective for packages, but when it came to a food delivery that requires immediate attention, the delivery person followed the sign and didn't knock, leading to the food being too cold. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent of the sign. She clearly communicated \"Do not Knock\" for packages. But food delivery is different. When you order food, you expect it to be delivered hot, and usually, delivery people knock to ensure someone's there to take it. By having a sign that says not to knock, she's making it so that even when there's a food delivery that needs to be taken immediately, they don't knock. The delivery person in this case followed the instructions literally, which worked for packages (since they can just leave them and don't need immediate attention), but food is time-sensitive. So maybe she didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. \n\nThe sign might have been intended for regular packages, but the food delivery company's standard procedure is to knock to ensure the recipient is present. By having the sign, she's conflicting with the necessary protocol for food delivery. The delivery person might not have known that the sign applies to food orders specifically. So, the author's sign was effective in preventing knocking for regular packages but caused issues when it shouldn't have. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she set up the sign with good intentions to avoid disturbance, but didn't account for the different needs of food deliveries. The delivery person followed the instructions as given, leading to a problem. The mother's solution (the sign) was effective for its intended purpose but inadvertently caused a problem when applied to a different type of delivery. So maybe she is at fault for not differentiating between package deliveries and food deliveries in her instructions. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person could have used common sense and knocked despite the sign for a food order. But the sign clearly says \"Do not Knock,\" so the delivery person might have been following the written instructions. However, common sense would dictate that food needs to be handed off immediately to stay hot, so maybe the delivery person should have knocked regardless. The author might expect that the sign is for packages only, but the delivery person might not know that. \n\nIn the end, the mother's solution (the sign) was too broad. She should have specified that the \"Do not Knock\" applies only to packages, not food deliveries. Since she didn't, the delivery person followed the instructions, leading to the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the different requirements of different delivery types. But then again, the delivery person should have used judgment. But the sign was explicit. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is partially at fault for not clarifying the scope of the sign, leading to the issue. Hence, Answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
