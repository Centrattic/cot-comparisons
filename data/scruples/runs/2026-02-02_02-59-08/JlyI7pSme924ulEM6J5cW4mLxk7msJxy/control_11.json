I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's been trying to get the delivery people to not knock on her door, both by using signs and notes in the checkout. The signs worked for packages, but when they used the same sign for a food delivery, the driver left the food at the door instead of knocking. The food was cold when she noticed. Her husband says they asked for it, but she feels it's common sense.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock, especially after the sign that worked for packages. The sign mentioned \"Do not knock\" and had logos of courier companies. The problem is that the food delivery person might have followed the same instruction as for packages, hence leaving it at the door. But the user probably expected that for food, which is time-sensitive, they should knock even if the sign says not to. \n\nThe key points are: 1) She tried various methods to communicate not to knock, which worked for packages. 2) The food delivery was delayed and then left unattended. 3) The user's intention was to avoid disturbance, but the result was a cold meal. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong if the sign was a general instruction without distinguishing between packages and food. However, it's also reasonable that the delivery person followed the sign literally, not considering the context of food delivery needing a different approach. The user's husband's comment implies they set up a situation that could lead to this outcome. But the user's frustration is about the cold food, which is a valid issue. \n\nIn terms of expectations, common sense might dictate that food delivery requires knocking to ensure timely receipt, unlike packages. However, the sign didn't specify that. So, maybe the user is partially at fault for not clarifying the context. But the delivery person also might have used judgment instead of strictly following the sign. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the sign's instructions were too broad. If the user intended to prevent knocking for all deliveries, including food, she might not be in the wrong. But the consequence of the cold food suggests a misunderstanding. The delivery person followed the instructions, but perhaps should have made an exception. Alternatively, the user should have realized the sign might cause issues with food. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because she was trying to avoid disturbance, a reasonable request. The delivery person's strict adherence without considering the perishable nature of food is the issue. However, some might argue she should have made the distinction. But given the context of being a new mom and the sign working for packages, it's a bit of a gray area. The main point is that the delivery person's action followed the given instructions, but the outcome wasn't what she wanted. So, she's not in the wrong.\n"
