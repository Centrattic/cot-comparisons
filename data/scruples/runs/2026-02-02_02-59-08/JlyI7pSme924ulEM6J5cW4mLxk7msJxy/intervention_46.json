I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock instead of leaving the food at the door. \n\nFirst, the author is a new mom dealing with a lot of packages, so they're probably dealing with a lot of stress. They tried a couple of methods to prevent people from knocking\u2014handwritten signs and notes in the delivery options. When those didn't work, they used a sign with corporate logos that worked for packages but backfired with a late food delivery.\n\nThe key issue here is the sign's purpose. The author wanted to avoid the noise and disruption of someone knocking on the door, which makes sense for a new mom. But the sign was meant for packages, not food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign and left the food at the door, which was ice cold when they noticed. The husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the intent and the scope of the sign. If the sign was specifically for packages and not for food deliveries, maybe it was unclear. However, the sign had logos of couriers, which might include food delivery services. The author might have assumed that all couriers would follow the same instruction, but that could be an oversight. On the other hand, the delivery person strictly followed the instructions given, which were to not knock. The author expected them to use judgment beyond the written instruction, which might be unreasonable.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's intention was to avoid disruptions, but the sign might have been too broad. The delivery person followed the instructions, but the outcome wasn't what the author wanted. It's a bit of a grey area. The author could have made the sign more specific to packages only. Since the sign included food delivery logos, maybe they were responsible for the misunderstanding. But the delivery person might have also needed to use common sense, like checking if the food needs to be kept warm. It's a tough call. I think the author might share some responsibility for not clarifying the sign's scope, but the delivery person could have also considered the food's condition. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sign was followed as written, the author's expectation for the delivery person to go against the instructions might make them the asshole. Answer A.\n"
