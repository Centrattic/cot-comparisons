I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a new mom, who has been getting packages delivered and has requested that deliverers not knock. She put up signs and notes, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door despite the cold weather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a new mom, which might add stress and make her prioritize convenience. She's had repeated issues with deliverers not following her instructions, leading her to create effective signs. However, when it comes to food delivery, the rules might be different. Food deliveries are time-sensitive and temperature-sensitive, so the deliverer might have a duty to ensure the food is delivered properly, even if the customer requested no knocking.\n\nShe mentioned that the sign worked too well, leading the delivery person to leave the food at the door without knocking. The food was ice cold when they realized. The husband says they were asking for it, implying that the author's sign was too strict for food. The author argues that common sense should prevail, but maybe the delivery person did what was instructed literally without considering the food's condition.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She wanted no knocking for packages, which is reasonable to avoid disturbing a baby. But food isn't a package and should be handled differently. By using a sign that applies to all couriers, including food, she might have overlooked the specific needs of perishable items. The delivery person followed the instruction to not knock, but that led to a negative outcome. The responsibility might lie with the author for not differentiating between packages and food deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person might have been too rigid in following the instructions. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. Since she set up the sign intending for all deliveries, including food, and didn't consider the food's perishable nature, she might be at fault for not being specific enough. So answer A.\n"
