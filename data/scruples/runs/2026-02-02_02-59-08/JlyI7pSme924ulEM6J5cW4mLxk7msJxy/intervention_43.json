I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (author) is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. They had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" but the delivery people kept knocking. So they put up a more prominent sign with courier logos, which worked for packages. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and it got cold. Now they're upset about that.\n\nThe question is, was the author wrong in expecting the deliverer to knock? The key points here are about communication and expectations. The author wanted to avoid being disturbed by knocks for packages, hence the \"Do not knock\" signs. But food delivery is different because people usually expect it to be delivered to their door and might need it to be warm. \n\nWhen they ordered dinner, maybe they should have specified that they wanted the delivery person to knock, but they didn't. They just had the sign up for packages. The sign might have been interpreted as a general rule for all deliveries, including food. However, the delivery person might not realize that food requires immediate attention. The author expected common sense, but maybe they didn't communicate that this rule didn't apply to food orders. \n\nOn the other hand, the author set up a system to prevent knocking for packages, which worked well. The problem arose because they didn't adjust the communication for the specific type of delivery. So maybe the author is at fault for not making an exception for food deliveries. \n\nThe husband said they were asking for it, which suggests that their own instructions led to the problem. The author might have been too rigid with the sign, not considering that food delivery requires different handling. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't adjust their communication for different delivery types.\n"
