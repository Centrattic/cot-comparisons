I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who had issues with delivery people knocking instead of just leaving packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and also wrote notes in the checkout. But those were ignored. So she got a new sign with the courier logos, which worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But then when they ordered food, it was left at the door, even though they were home. The food got cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she's conflicted, thinking common sense should prevail.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. The main issue is whether she had the right to expect the delivery person to knock despite her sign. She wanted packages left at the door without knocking, but when they did follow the sign, it backfired when it was food. So the problem is that the sign was meant for packages, not food. The delivery person followed the instruction literally, but maybe the author should have distinguished between packages and food.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to check if that's correct. The author's sign was for deliveries in general, maybe not specific to food. The delivery person used the sign to leave the food without knocking, leading to the problem. The author might be at fault for not clarifying that food should be handled differently. But maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. However, the sign was clear, so they followed it. The author's expectations were conflicting\u2014she wanted no knocking for packages but implied that food should be knocked. Since she didn't specify, the delivery person acted on the existing instructions. So the author might be in the wrong for not being clear, leading to the unintended consequence. So the answer would be A.\n"
