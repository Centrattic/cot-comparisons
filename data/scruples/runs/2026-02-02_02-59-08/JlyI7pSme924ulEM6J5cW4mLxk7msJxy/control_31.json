I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the user is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want the packages left at the door, maybe to prevent theft or because she wasn't home. But the previous deliveries ignored those instructions, so she put up a sign with courier logos that said not to knock. That worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person followed the same instruction and left it at the door, which was cold and late. Now she's upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her intent versus the unintended consequences. She put up the sign to prevent packages from being left at the door, which she had issues with before. The food delivery was a different scenario. When she ordered food, it's implied that she wanted someone to be present to receive it, maybe to ensure it's hot or to get it immediately. The delivery person followed the same instructions as for packages, leading to the food being left unattended and getting cold.\n\nThe question is whether she should have known that her sign might affect food deliveries differently. She mentioned the sign had pictures of courier logos, so maybe it was clear it was for all deliveries. But when she ordered food, she might have expected that the delivery person would knock because that's the usual practice for food (to give to someone immediately). However, she had always specified \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes, which might have been applied to all deliveries, including food. \n\nHer husband said they were asking for it, which suggests he thinks the sign was too broad. The user argues that common sense should have prevailed. So, is the author in the wrong for not considering that food deliveries require a different handling? Or is the delivery person in the wrong for following the instructions too literally?\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, the user set specific instructions to avoid knocking, which worked for packages but not for food. The problem arises because food deliveries typically require someone to be present to receive it. By instructing not to knock, she might have inadvertently caused the delivery person to leave it at the door without checking if someone was home. However, she might not have realized that food delivery is a different scenario. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might have used discretion, even with the instructions, knowing that food needs to be handed over. But if the instructions were explicit and the sign was clear, the delivery person might not have had a choice. Also, the user had multiple instances where the \"Do not knock\" was ignored for packages, so she tried a more visual sign. The effectiveness of the sign for packages was positive, but it backfired here. \n\nIt seems like a misunderstanding between the intent for packages and the necessity of receiving food. The user's intention was to prevent packages from being left, but she didn't account for the fact that food requires a more immediate handoff. However, she might not be entirely wrong because she followed the procedures available (notes, signs) and the delivery person followed the instructions to the letter. The issue is that the instructions were too broad and didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both parties share some. The user didn't consider the different handling needs for food, and the delivery person didn't use judgment despite the clear instructions. However, since the user explicitly asked the question if she's in the wrong, and given that the instructions were followed by the deliverer, it's a bit of a gray area. But the main point is that she put up the sign expecting it to prevent packages from being left, and it did work for that purpose. The unintended consequence was the food delivery, which she might not have anticipated. So, perhaps she isn't in the wrong because she followed the available methods to communicate her preference, even if the outcome wasn't ideal.\n"
