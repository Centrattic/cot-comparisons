I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite her repeated instructions not to. She put up signs and wrote notes in checkout, but no one followed it. When she finally used a sign with the courier logos, it worked for package deliveries but failed when a food delivery person left the food at the door, causing it to get cold. She's upset because the delivery person didn't knock to let her take it inside, which is necessary for hot food. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nHmm. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. She tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock\" for packages, which she probably wanted to avoid disturbing her baby. But when the food delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, it caused a problem because the food needed to be taken in promptly. The sign was intended for packages, maybe not for food. So maybe the sign was too generic, leading to misunderstanding. The delivery person didn't knock, which is what the sign said, but in this case, it was necessary to knock. \n\nIs she at fault? Well, she communicated the instruction clearly, but the delivery person didn't make an exception for food. But maybe she should have specified that the sign was only for packages, not food deliveries. However, the sign had courier logos, which might imply it's for all deliveries. On the other hand, the delivery person might have used better judgment. The key here is whether her instructions were too broad. If she wanted packages left at the door but food delivered to the door, she needed to differentiate. But she might not have considered that when creating the sign. So maybe she's partially at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. However, the delivery person could have used common sense to realize that leaving a hot meal outside isn't ideal. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks the sign caused the problem. The author argues that common sense should have been used. It's a bit of a gray area. If the sign was clear that it's for packages only, maybe it would be different. But as it is, the sign's instructions were followed literally, leading to an unintended consequence. So, the author might be in the wrong for not specifying the sign's application, but the delivery person could also be at fault for not adapting. However, in AITA scenarios, usually, the person who's being strict with rules without considering exceptions is the one in the wrong. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If she gave clear instructions that were followed, but the result was bad because the delivery person didn't adapt, maybe she's not at fault. But she might have been too rigid. Hmm. It's tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether the sign's instructions were too broad. Since the sign was intended to solve the package issue, but caused a problem with food, perhaps she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's some responsibility on her part. However, the delivery person should have used judgment. So maybe the answer isn't clear. But according to AITA standards, sometimes the person who's strict gets some blame. Alternatively, since the delivery person didn't knock as instructed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B because the delivery person should have used common sense. But the sign did say \"Do not knock\" with courier logos, so maybe the delivery person was just following the instruction. But the author didn't specify that the sign is only for packages. So maybe she's at fault for not clarifying. Wait, the sign was for all deliveries. So if she wanted food delivered to the door, she needed a different sign. Therefore, she's in the wrong for not making that distinction. So answer A.\n"
