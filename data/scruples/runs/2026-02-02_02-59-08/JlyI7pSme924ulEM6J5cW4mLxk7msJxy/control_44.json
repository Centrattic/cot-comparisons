I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's been using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid the noise, which is understandable, especially with a baby. The signs worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, causing the food to be cold. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key here is intent. The author's intention was to prevent packages from being left at the door in the past, so she created signs to instruct delivery people. But food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left safely, but food needs to be handled with care, like staying warm. The sign might have been misinterpreted or the delivery person didn't consider the difference between a food order and a regular package. \n\nThe author did put \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes before, but the delivery person ignored it. Now, with the sign, it's working too well for food. The problem is that the sign's instructions led to a negative outcome here. The author might not have considered that the \"Do not knock\" rule doesn't apply to food deliveries, which require different handling. \n\nHowever, the delivery person should have used their judgment. Even if the sign says not to knock, they should check if the package is food, which needs to be handed over to avoid getting cold. So maybe the delivery person is at fault for not using common sense. The husband's comment that they were asking for it might be valid in the sense that the sign was too broad, but the delivery person's responsibility is to ensure the food is delivered properly. \n\nThe author's main mistake could be not differentiating between packages and food in the sign. If she had a separate sign for food, it might have worked better. But given that she's a new mom and stressed, it's understandable she might not have thought of that. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She followed the usual methods, but maybe the sign was too restrictive. However, the delivery person should have recognized that food delivery requires handling differently. The answer isn't clear-cut, but maybe the author shares some responsibility for not considering the difference in delivery types. But since the sign was effective for packages, she might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
