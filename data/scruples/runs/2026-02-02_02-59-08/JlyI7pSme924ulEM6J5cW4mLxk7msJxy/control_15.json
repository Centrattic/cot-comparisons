I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock after they had signs saying not to knock. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with a lot of packages. They had signs that said \"Do not Knock\" and also used the delivery notes to specify that. But people kept knocking anyway. So they made a sign with corporate logos that worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, it was left at the door and got cold. Now they're wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by using the sign, which led to the food being left unattended. The sign worked for packages, but maybe not for food deliveries. The author might not have considered that different delivery types have different protocols. For packages, it's common to leave them at the door if no one's home, but food usually requires someone to be present because it's perishable. The author's sign might have been ignored by package deliverers, leading to frustration, but when applied to food, it had the opposite effect. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that maybe the author's solution was too broad. The author might be in the wrong because they generalized the sign to all deliveries, not realizing that food delivery needs a different approach. They expected the deliverer to use common sense, but perhaps they should have specified \"knock for food deliveries only\" or had a separate sign for packages. \n\nOn the other hand, the deliverer should have used judgment to assess whether the item needed to be signed for or if it was a package. But since the sign was there, maybe they just followed instructions. The author's problem is that their solution, while effective for packages, caused issues with food. So maybe the author didn't consider the different delivery needs. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they applied the same rule to all deliveries without considering that food requires a different handling. They should have adjusted the sign to differentiate between package and food deliveries.\n"
