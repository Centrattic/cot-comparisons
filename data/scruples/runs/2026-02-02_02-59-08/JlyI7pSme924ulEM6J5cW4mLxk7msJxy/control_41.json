And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a new mom and gets a lot of packages delivered. She's had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and tried various methods to make sure people don't knock. The delivery people kept ignoring her instructions. Then she found a sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was ice cold and took 45 minutes late.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The user is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The key points here are her instructions and the outcome. She tried multiple times to specify not to knock, but the delivery person from the food service didn't follow that. But the food delivery might have different protocols compared to package deliveries. \n\nWait, she used a sign with corporate logos. Maybe the food delivery company isn't the same as the package courier? The sign mentions \"Do not knock\" but maybe the food delivery people are supposed to knock regardless. If the food was left at the door, that's an issue, but the sign might have been for packages, not food. The user might have confused the two services. So, maybe the sign was misdirected, leading the food deliverer to follow the wrong instruction. \n\nAlso, she mentioned she wrote \"Do not knock\" in the delivery notes for packages, but when ordering food, maybe the delivery instructions are handled differently. The food delivery person might not see the same notes as the package couriers. So, even if she included the note, maybe it didn't reach the food deliverer. \n\nBut in the scenario, the food delivery person saw the sign and left it at the door. The sign had corporate logos, which might have been specific to package delivery services like FedEx or Amazon, not food delivery apps like DoorDash or Uber Eats. So, the food deliverer might have thought they weren't supposed to knock because of the sign, even though the sign was for a different service. \n\nSo the problem is that her sign was for packages, but when ordering food, the delivery person followed the same instruction, leading to the food being left unattended. That's the user's fault for not differentiating between package delivery instructions and food delivery. She expected the food deliverer to knock, but her instructions were possibly for a different service. Therefore, she might be at fault for using a sign that applied to packages, not food delivery. \n\nAdditionally, the husband said they were asking for it, which suggests he thinks the sign was too broad and applied to all deliveries. The user argues common sense should have prevailed, but maybe the delivery person just followed the sign's instructions without considering that it might be for a different service. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because she used a sign intended for package deliveries, which led to confusion with food delivery. She should have specified different instructions for different types of deliveries. Therefore, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
