I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for package deliveries because she didn't want delivery people to knock. She tried different signs and notes, and eventually found one that worked. But when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to it being cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, she might be dealing with a lot, maybe even needing to rest or attend to the baby, so not wanting to be disturbed makes sense. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference, which shows she's clear about her needs. The sign worked for packages but not for food. Food delivery might require different handling, but the sign didn't specify. However, she didn't mention if the food delivery instructions were different from package ones. Maybe the delivery person assumed the same rule applied to food, which is a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, food delivery is time-sensitive. The delivery person should have used their judgment here. Even if there's a sign, leaving food outside in the cold isn't safe. Most people would understand that food needs to be handed off to avoid spoilage. The author didn't account for that nuance in her sign. She expected the delivery person to use common sense, but maybe the sign was too broad. The husband's point is that by being so strict about not knocking, she set up a situation where food would be mishandled. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to not be disturbed, but she didn't consider the implications for food. The delivery person did follow the instructions literally but missed the context of food requiring immediate handoff. The author might share some responsibility for not tailoring the sign to differentiate between packages and food. Therefore, the answer could be A, that she's in the wrong, but maybe partially. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong entirely. Since she made the sign that led to the problem, even if unknowingly, she might be at fault.\n"
