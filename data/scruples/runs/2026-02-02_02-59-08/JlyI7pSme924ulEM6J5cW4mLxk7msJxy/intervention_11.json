I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been dealing with delivery people knocking despite her multiple attempts to specify \"Do not knock.\" She even put up a sign with company logos to stop the knocking, which worked for packages but not for food delivery. When she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she successfully did with the sign. However, food delivery might require immediate attention since it's perishable, unlike packages. The sign might not have been clear that it applies to food. The delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to a problem. The author didn't consider that the sign might be misinterpreted for different types of deliveries. She expected the delivery person to use judgment despite the instructions. So, she might have overstepped by using a sign that's too broad. The answer is A.\n"
