I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer not to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which were ignored. Then she used a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but caused the food delivery to be left outside, resulting in cold food. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: she had clear instructions not to knock, which were followed for packages but not for food. The food deliverer, seeing the same sign, left it at the door. The result was cold food. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she had a valid reason for, perhaps because of being a new mom needing quiet or not wanting interruptions. However, the food delivery situation is different from package deliveries. Food is time-sensitive and temperature-sensitive, so the deliverer might have needed to knock to ensure timely delivery, especially if the recipient wasn't present. \n\nBut the sign said not to knock, so the deliverer followed the instruction literally. However, in this case, the instruction might have been inappropriate for food. The author might not have considered that food delivery requires different handling. She expected the deliverer to use judgment, but the instructions were explicit. The husband's comment that they asked for it suggests that the sign's instructions led to the problem. The author's belief that common sense should prevail implies she expects flexibility, but the deliverer might have just followed orders without judgment. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not considering that food delivery needs a different approach. The sign was meant for packages, but she applied it to food as well. She might be at fault for assuming the same rules apply to both types of deliveries without considering the different needs. Alternatively, the deliverer should have known better, but maybe the author didn't clarify. However, the sign was specific to the company's logo, which might indicate it's for packages. The problem is the sign's scope. If the sign was only for package deliveries, but the food delivery driver saw it and followed it, maybe the author didn't make her instructions clear enough. But she had written \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes before, which were ignored. So she used a visual sign that worked, but perhaps without specifying exceptions. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be partly at fault for not differentiating between package and food deliveries in her instructions. The deliverer followed the sign strictly, leading to an unintended consequence. She should have realized that food delivery requires a different approach. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
