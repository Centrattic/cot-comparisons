I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who's a new mom) is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. She had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, which were ignored, so she made a new sign with courier logos that worked\u2014until the food delivery was left outside, getting cold.\n\nFirst, her original problem was with package deliveries being knocked on, even though she specified not to. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and orders. Then she created a visual sign to make it clearer. It worked for packages but failed when a food delivery person followed it, leading to a cold meal.\n\nThe key points here: the sign was intended to prevent knocking for packages, not food deliveries. However, the food deliverer saw the same sign and left the food without knocking. The question is whether the author is at fault for not considering that food deliveries require a different approach. Food needs to be handed over, not left outside, so maybe the sign was too broad. \n\nBut the author didn't specify \"only for packages\" on the sign. So, maybe she should have made a distinction between packages and food orders. The deliverer followed the sign literally, which wasn't the author's intention for food. The husband's comment \"we were asking for it\" suggests that the solution was flawed. The author's expectation was that common sense would prevail, but the deliverer didn't use it. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not differentiating the instructions for different types of deliveries. She expected the deliverer to use judgment, which might not be reasonable. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
