I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a new mom who's used to getting packages and has been trying to prevent delivery people from knocking because of the baby. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, both on the door and in the delivery notes. Initially, people ignored her, so she got a more prominent sign with company logos. That worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. Now she's upset about that.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her intent vs. the unintended consequences. She wanted to avoid disturbances for the baby, which is understandable. She took steps to communicate her preference clearly. The sign was effective for packages, so that's logical. However, when it came to food delivery, the delivery person followed the same instruction, which led to the food being left unattended and becoming cold. \n\nThe user is asking if she's at fault. On one hand, she communicated her instructions clearly, and the delivery person followed them. On the other hand, maybe she should have made a distinction between packages and food deliveries. But the sign didn't specify, so the delivery person had no reason to treat it differently. \n\nHer husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" implying that by not knocking, they caused the problem. But the sign didn't say \"knock only for food,\" so the delivery person had no way of knowing. The author might have assumed that common sense would make the delivery person knock for food, but the sign's purpose was to avoid knocking entirely. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she didn't specify different instructions for different types of deliveries, the delivery person followed the given instructions. However, maybe she should have considered that food deliveries require immediate attention. But the sign didn't differentiate, so the delivery person had to follow the same rule. \n\nIn that case, the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her instructions, and the issue was a misunderstanding in the sign's scope. The delivery person followed the instructions as given. The problem was the sign being too broad. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong. Wait, but maybe she should have realized that food needs someone to answer. But since the sign didn't specify, maybe it's not her fault. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe she's partially at fault for not considering that food delivery requires knocking. But the sign didn't say to knock for food. So the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because she communicated her instructions, and the delivery person followed them. The issue is that the instructions were too general, but that's on the sign's design, not necessarily her fault. So I think the answer is B.\n"
