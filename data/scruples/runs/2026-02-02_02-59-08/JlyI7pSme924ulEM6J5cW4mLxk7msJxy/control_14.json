I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a new mom who's received many packages. She had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but people still knocked. Then she used a more prominent sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with a food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of both parties. The author wanted to avoid being disturbed, especially as a new mom who might be busy or need rest. She took steps to communicate her preference. The delivery person, however, might have followed the sign's instruction to not knock, which led to the food being left outside and getting cold. \n\nCommon sense is mentioned here. The delivery person should have realized that food deliveries require the recipient to be present to accept them, unlike packages. Leaving perishable food at the door without knocking could lead to spoilage. The author's frustration is valid because the food was ruined. However, the sign was clear, and the delivery person might have followed it literally, not considering the context. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he blames the author for using the sign. But the author's intention was to avoid disturbances, not to risk ruining food. The key point is whether the author's request was reasonable. Using a sign to prevent knocking for packages is reasonable, but food delivery is different. However, the author couldn't have anticipated the delivery person's literal interpretation. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's sign was an unreasonable request. Since food delivery typically requires someone to be present, the author might not be at fault. The delivery person should have used judgment to knock despite the sign. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
