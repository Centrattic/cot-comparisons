I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She tried multiple times to tell the delivery people not to knock by using signs and notes, but they kept knocking. So she put up a sign with courier logos that said not to knock. It worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nHmm. First, the author's intention was to prevent the door from being knocked on, which was working for packages. But when it came to food delivery, leaving it at the door without notification led to it being cold. The key here is whether the author's sign was too broad or if the food delivery person overstepped by not notifying them, even though the sign said not to knock.\n\nThe sign included food delivery logos, so the food person saw it and left it immediately without any contact. The problem is that the food delivery requires timely notification. The author didn't realize that the same rule for packages might not apply to food, which is time-sensitive. By putting up the sign, she might have inadvertently caused the delivery person to not follow up, leading to the cold meal. \n\nThe author did try to specify \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes, but those were ignored. However, when she used a visual sign, it worked too well. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to the letter, not considering the urgency of food. So, the author might have been careless in not differentiating between packages and food deliveries. The husband's point that they were asking for it makes sense because the sign didn't make an exception for food. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had legitimate reasons to not want to be disturbed since she's a new mom. But the solution might have been to create separate signs or instructions for different types of deliveries. Since she didn't, the food delivery person followed the sign as written. The author's mistake was not tailoring the instructions, leading to an unintended consequence. Therefore, she's partially at fault for not considering how the sign might affect food deliveries.\n"
