I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who has been trying to prevent delivery people from knocking on her door. She used signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but they were ignored. Eventually, she put up a sign with the courier logos that worked in preventing knocks, but when she ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which got cold. She's upset about the late and cold food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to avoid being disturbed, especially as a new mom who might need rest or quiet. She took steps to communicate her preferences clearly, but the delivery people didn't follow them. This led her to take a stronger measure with the sign. However, when the food delivery person followed the sign's instruction not to knock, it resulted in a problem\u2014the food being left at the door and getting cold. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she made her wishes known, but maybe she should have considered that some situations require knocking, like food delivery where the customer isn't home. However, she might not have intended for that specific scenario. The sign might have been too broad, applying to all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, leading to an unintended consequence. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he thinks the author's solution was excessive or caused the problem. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have knocked despite the sign. But common sense can vary. If the sign was clear, the delivery person might have felt bound by it. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? She tried to communicate her needs but maybe didn't specify exceptions. The delivery person followed the instructions, but the outcome was negative. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are whether the sign was too ambiguous, if the author should have considered different delivery types, and if the delivery person should have used judgment. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because her intention was to avoid disturbance. However, the solution might have been too broad. The delivery person might have been within their rights to follow the sign, but the food delivery scenario is different from a package. The outcome was an unintended consequence, so maybe the author isn't the asshole. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B (No) because she tried to communicate her needs and the problem arose from a misunderstanding or a different delivery type. The delivery person might have been following the rules too strictly. So, the answer would be B.\n"
