I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom who gets many packages. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" which were ignored. So she changed to a sign with pictures of courier logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with a food delivery. The delivery person left the food at the door instead of knocking, leading to it being cold.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author wanted packages left at the door, not knocked. She communicated this through signs and notes. When a food delivery came, the driver followed the package instructions, which the author intended for packages but not food. The food was left outside and got cold. The author is upset because she expected the driver to use common sense and knock for food, even though the signs were for packages.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? She set up the sign to avoid being disturbed by package deliveries, which is reasonable. However, food delivery might be a different scenario, as it's time-sensitive and usually requires someone to take it immediately. The driver might not distinguish between packages and food orders based on the sign. The author didn't specify that the no-knock policy was only for packages, which could be a problem. But given that she had the sign up for the right reason (packages) and the driver followed it, leading to an unintended consequence with food, maybe the author didn't consider the different contexts. However, the driver should have used judgment to knock for a food delivery, assuming it's important. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's intention was to minimize disturbances, which is valid. The driver's mistake might be on them for not discerning between package and food orders. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because the sign was for packages, and the driver misapplied it. But the author could have clarified the sign's scope. Hmm.\n"
