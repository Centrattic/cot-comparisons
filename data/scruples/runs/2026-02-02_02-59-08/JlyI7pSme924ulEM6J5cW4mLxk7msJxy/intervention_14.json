I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking on her door, which she did because previous packages were left at the door and she wanted them to ring the doorbell instead. But when they used the same sign for a food delivery, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which got cold. The author is upset about that, and her husband says they were asking for it. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, maybe she's dealing with a lot and the noise from deliveries is a hassle. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference not to be knocked, which worked for packages. Then she used the same sign for food delivery, which led to the food being left outside and getting cold. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) She created a sign that worked for packages but didn't consider that food delivery might require a different approach. 2) The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, leading to an unintended consequence. \n\nIs it her fault? Well, she might not have realized that food delivery requires the delivery person to knock to ensure the recipient is present to receive it immediately. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive. By using the same sign for food, she set up a scenario where the delivery person followed the rules but caused a problem. \n\nHowever, maybe she should have made a distinction between packages and food deliveries. The sign was clear, but maybe it's ambiguous. The delivery person might not know the difference between a package and a food order just from the sign. So, she could be at fault for not clarifying that the \"Do not Knock\" rule applies only to packages. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might have used common sense and knocked anyway, especially since food is different. But the sign said not to knock, so they followed instructions. It's a bit of a catch-22. \n\nThe user thinks she's in the wrong. The husband's comment adds fuel to that. The question is whether she should have foreseen that using the same sign for food would lead to this issue. Maybe she didn't consider the different handling required for food. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: She tried to communicate her preference, which worked for packages, but not for food. The delivery person followed the instructions literally. She might be in the wrong for not making the distinction, but it's also a bit of a system failure\u2014maybe the sign should have specified. However, since the sign was clear and the delivery person didn't use common sense, perhaps it's a shared responsibility. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. I think the answer is A (yes), because she created a sign that led to an unintended consequence without considering the different nature of food deliveries.\n"
