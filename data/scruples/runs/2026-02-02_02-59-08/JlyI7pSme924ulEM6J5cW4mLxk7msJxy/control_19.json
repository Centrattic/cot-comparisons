I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a new mom with a lot of packages. They tried various ways to tell the delivery people not to knock, like handwritten signs and notes in the checkout. But people kept knocking. Then they used a sign with the courier's logos, which worked, but now the food delivery guy left the food at the door, and it got cold because they didn't notice.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A for yes and B for no. I need to figure out the answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the author tried to prevent knocking because maybe they had a baby and didn't want to be disturbed. They used signs and notes, which didn't work. Then they used a more effective sign with the courier logos, which made the delivery person leave the food at the door instead of knocking. The problem is that the food was left in the cold and didn't get delivered properly.\n\nIs the author wrong here? Well, they were trying to prevent knocking, which is understandable as a new mom. But by putting up the sign, they might have led the delivery person to assume that leaving the food at the door was acceptable. The delivery instructions might have been to knock if there's no answer, but the sign said not to. The delivery person followed the sign, which worked for packages but not for food. The food delivery might require a different approach, especially since perishable items need to be handled differently.\n\nThe key points are that the author's solution was effective for packages but not for food. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which the author intended for packages, but it caused an issue with food. The author might not have considered that different types of deliveries (food vs. packages) might need different handling. So maybe the author is not entirely at fault, but there could be a misunderstanding in how the sign was applied.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person should have checked if there were specific instructions for food delivery. Maybe the author should have specified different instructions for food versus packages. But since the sign didn't differentiate, the delivery person followed the general instruction. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the author should have anticipated that the sign might cause issues with food deliveries and adjusted it accordingly. But since they didn't, maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used better judgment. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to protect their peace with a baby, and the sign's effectiveness for packages shows it was necessary. The food delivery issue is a side effect of the solution, and the delivery person followed instructions. However, the author might need to adjust their signs to specify exceptions for food. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't to blame for the delivery person's actions based on the given instructions.\n"
