I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a new mom who gets a lot of packages. They put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, but the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So they made a new sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked in stopping the knocking. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nThe author is upset because the food was left outside, making it cold, and they're asking if they're the asshole. The husband says they were asking for it. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know what I think. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author wanted to avoid the noise of deliveries, so they made a sign to prevent knocking. But when it came to food delivery, the same sign led to the food being left outside, which wasn't desired. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sign was intended for packages, but the food delivery person might not have realized it was for food. The sign probably said not to knock for packages, but didn't specify that it's okay for food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, but maybe didn't consider the context. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have a way to differentiate between packages and food deliveries in their sign. They might have assumed that delivery people would use common sense. But common sense isn't always applied. The author's solution worked for packages but caused a problem for food. \n\nSo, the author's sign was effective in stopping the knocking, but maybe they should have thought about the potential issues with food deliveries. However, they might not have realized that the sign would also apply to food. The delivery person might not have checked if it was food or a package. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the sign, expecting delivery people to follow it, but didn't account for food. The delivery person followed the instructions without considering the context. The author might be partly at fault for not clarifying the sign, but the delivery person also didn't use common sense. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering that the sign was intended to avoid knocking for all deliveries, including food, the author might have been too rigid. They might have ignored the different needs of food delivery versus packages. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they set up a rule without considering the exceptions. But another perspective is that the delivery person should have known the difference. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because the author's solution had unintended consequences they should have anticipated.\n"
