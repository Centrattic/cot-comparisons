I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a new mom who has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door, despite her repeated signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" She ended up using a more prominent sign with courier logos, which worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, resulting in cold food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had clear instructions not to knock, and those were ignored repeatedly. She took steps to make the instructions more visible, which was effective for packages. However, when it came to a food delivery that required immediate attention (since it's perishable), the delivery person followed the same instructions, leading to a problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, she had a valid reason for not wanting to be disturbed\u2014being a new mom, so she might need quiet or rest. She tried multiple times to communicate her wishes. On the other hand, food deliveries are different from packages. Packages can be left outside safely, but food needs to be delivered promptly to stay warm or fresh. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instructions without considering the context of the delivery type.\n\nThe author's husband says they \"asked for it,\" implying they should have considered that the sign might cause issues with food. The author argues that common sense should prevail. The key here is whether the delivery person should have recognized that food delivery requires a different approach, even if the sign says not to knock.\n\nLegally, delivery instructions are generally followed as given, unless there's a safety concern. However, in practical terms, common sense might require the delivery person to assess the situation. If the package is a food item, it's reasonable to assume that the recipient might be at home expecting it and that it needs to be handed over directly to prevent spoilage. The delivery person might have followed the sign too literally without considering the food aspect.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely at fault. She had a legitimate need and communicated it clearly. The issue arose because the sign was applied to a different type of delivery. The delivery person could have used judgment to knock despite the sign, especially since food is time-sensitive. The author's request was reasonable for packages, but the delivery person's failure to adapt for food delivery might be their fault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
