I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has various delivery instructions to not knock on the door. She used signs and notes repeatedly, and it worked for packages. Then when they ordered food, the delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door, but it got cold. She's upset because the food was late and cold, and her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the rules and expectations here. The mom set up clear instructions: \"Do not knock.\" She used signs and wrote it in delivery notes. The sign had pictures of courier logos, so the delivery person saw it and followed it. But the issue is that food delivery requires a knock or some interaction to hand over the food. Packages can be left at the door, but food usually needs a person to receive it. \n\nSo, by placing a sign that says \"Do not knock,\" she's instructing the delivery person not to knock. However, when ordering food, the expectation is that the delivery person will knock to give the food immediately. Leaving it outside would be inappropriate because food needs to be handed over to stay hot. The delivery person followed the rule, but the rule wasn't appropriate for food deliveries. \n\nThe mom might not have considered that the \"Do not knock\" rule applies to packages but not to food. She expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the delivery person followed the instructions literally. The problem here is the ambiguity in the rules. If the mom wanted to prevent knocks for packages but not for food, she should have specified. Since she didn't, the delivery person followed the sign correctly, leading to an unintended consequence. \n\nSo, the mom's mistake was not differentiating between types of deliveries in her instructions. She set a rule that worked for packages but not for food. Therefore, she's in the wrong because she didn't provide clear exceptions for food deliveries, leading to the cold food situation. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
