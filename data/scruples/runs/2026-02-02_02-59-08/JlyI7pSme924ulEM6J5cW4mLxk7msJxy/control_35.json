I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has various signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking when leaving packages. She even created a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with a food delivery that was left at the door and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author tried multiple times to communicate that they don't want to be disturbed, probably because she's a new mom and wants to avoid interruptions. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was to not knock, hence leaving the food outside. The food got cold because it was left there. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The delivery person followed the explicit instruction given on the sign. The sign was clear and in the delivery options note. The problem is that food delivery might require different handling than packages. Packages can be left, but food needs to be timely and perhaps requires the recipient to be present to receive it. However, the sign didn't specify different treatment for food versus packages. The delivery person might not realize that the sign's instruction applies to packages but not food. But the sign didn't have that distinction.\n\nThe author's intention was to avoid disturbances, which is understandable. However, the sign's message was too broad. She might not be in the wrong because she tried to communicate her preference clearly, but the delivery person's action was in compliance with the instructions given. The issue is that the sign didn't account for different types of deliveries. The author might be in the wrong if she expected the delivery person to use judgment beyond the written instruction. But if the instruction was clear, maybe the delivery person is just following orders. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense and realized that food requires timely delivery, hence knocking would be necessary. The author's husband's comment suggests that they were being too prescriptive, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's sign was too general. She might be in the wrong for not specifying that food deliveries are an exception. However, the delivery person might also be in the right for following the instructions given. But the author's husband says they were \"asking for it,\" implying that their own actions caused the problem. The author argues that common sense should have been used. The key here is whether the delivery person should have used judgment instead of strictly following the sign. If the delivery person had to knock to ensure the food was received promptly, then they should have, even if the sign said not to. However, the sign didn't differentiate between package and food delivery. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being specific enough. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their own judgment. It's a bit of a gray area. But given that the sign was explicit and the delivery person followed it without question, the author might not be in the wrong, as she tried to communicate her needs, and the delivery person's mistake was in not applying common sense. But if the instruction was clear, maybe she is at fault for not foreseeing that different deliveries need different handling. I'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong because the sign was meant to prevent disturbances, and the delivery person's action was in line with the instructions, but the unintended consequence is on her. Or maybe she is in the wrong because she should have known that food delivery requires different handling and adjusted her sign accordingly. Hmm. I think the answer hinges on whether the sign was too broad. Since she had previously used similar signs for packages which worked, but this time it was food, she might be at fault for not differentiating. So, the answer could be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't specify exceptions. But others might argue that the delivery person should have used judgment. Given the AITA context, usually, the person is not in the wrong if they tried to communicate their needs, even if there was an unintended consequence. But since the problem arose from the instructions she gave, maybe she is in the wrong. I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. The sign said \"Do not knock\" without exceptions. If the delivery person followed that, then the author's instructions led to the problem. Therefore, she is in the wrong because she didn't account for different types of deliveries. So answer A.\n"
