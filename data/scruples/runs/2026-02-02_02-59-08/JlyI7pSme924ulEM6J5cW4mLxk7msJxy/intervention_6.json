I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages. They kept getting knocked on the door even though they had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and also used the delivery notes. The person tried different methods, even a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but then caused a problem when they ordered food.\n\nThe food delivery person left the meal at the door because of the sign, and it got cold. The author is upset about the cold food and the 45-minute delay. Their husband thinks they asked for it. The author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the rules of the delivery service. Packages and food deliveries are different. The signs were for packages, but when they ordered food, maybe the food delivery person followed the same sign even though it's not a package. The author expected the food to be delivered with a knock, but the sign was there. Maybe the delivery person was just following the sign without considering the context. \n\nThe author set up the sign for packages, which worked, but the food delivery was an exception. The problem is that the food delivery requires a knock to ensure it's delivered hot, but the sign said not to knock. So the author's solution was good for packages but not for food. The delivery person might not have known to differentiate between package and food deliveries. \n\nIs the author wrong? They wanted the sign for packages, which is understandable, especially as a new mom who might be busy. But they didn't account for food deliveries needing a knock. The delivery person followed the sign literally. The author might have been too strict without considering different types of deliveries. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person also could have used common sense. Maybe the sign should have specified \"No knock for packages only.\" But the author didn't do that. So perhaps the author is partially at fault for not making that distinction. However, the delivery person also didn't question the instruction when it might not apply. \n\nI think the key here is that the sign was meant for packages, but the food delivery person followed it without considering the different requirements. The author didn't specify the exception for food, leading to the issue. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because the delivery person should have used some judgment. But the author's sign was a bit ambiguous. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIf the sign clearly said \"No knock for packages,\" maybe it's the delivery person's fault. But since it was a general \"Do not knock\" sign, the delivery person followed it. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for different delivery types. But maybe the delivery person should have known that food needs to be handed off. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was to stop knocking for packages, and the delivery person misapplied the rule. The author isn't wrong for wanting to avoid knocks, but maybe should have had a separate note for food. However, given the situation, the delivery person's literal following of the sign without context makes the author not the asshole. So B.\n"
