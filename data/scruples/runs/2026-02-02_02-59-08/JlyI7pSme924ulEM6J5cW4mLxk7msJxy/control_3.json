I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation involves a new mom who had previous issues with delivery people knocking despite clear instructions not to. She put up signs with the courier logos to prevent that, and the last time, the delivery person left the food at the door, which got cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to stop deliveries from knocking, which she had a valid reason for, especially as a new mom. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and signs. The sign with the logos worked in the sense that the delivery person didn't knock, but left the food at the door, leading to it being cold. The main conflict is whether the delivery person should have knocked despite the sign, or if the author's sign was too explicit and caused the problem.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author wanted no knocking, so she used a sign that effectively communicated that. The delivery person followed the instruction literally, not knocking and leaving the food unattended. However, the unintended consequence was the food getting cold. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he thinks the author's sign led to the problem. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed\u2014maybe the delivery person should have knocked even if there's a sign, or left the food in a safer place.\n\nBut from the delivery person's perspective, they followed the instructions given. The sign said not to knock, so they complied. The author might be in the wrong if her sign was too absolute, not allowing for exceptions like food delivery where knocking might be necessary. However, the sign's purpose was clear: no knocking. The delivery person might not have the means to leave food safely without knocking, especially in colder weather. The author didn't consider that the sign might prevent communication needed for proper delivery. So, maybe the author is at fault for not anticipating that the sign could lead to issues like the food getting cold. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment despite the sign. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's instructions were clear, and the delivery person followed them, so the author might be in the wrong for not considering the practical implications of her own instructions.\n"
