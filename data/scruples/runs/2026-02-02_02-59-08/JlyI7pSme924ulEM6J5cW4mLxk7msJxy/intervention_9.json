I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been getting packages delivered and kept getting knocked on the door despite her signs saying not to. She tried various methods to prevent the knock, and eventually, a sign with the courier logos worked. But then, when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door even though it was ice cold. The husband says they asked for it, and the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's intention was to stop the knocking, which was a valid concern, especially for a new mom who might need rest or have a baby. She used clear instructions and signs, which were ignored until the pictorial sign worked. However, when the food was delivered, the courier followed the sign's instruction to leave packages at the door, which led to the food being cold. The key here is whether the author reasonably expected the food delivery to be an exception to the sign, even though the sign was about packages in general.\n\nThe sign mentioned \"Do not Knock\" and had logos for different couriers. The food delivery person saw the sign and left the food at the door, which is standard procedure for package delivery, but food is perishable. The author might not have considered that food delivery requires different handling. The husband's point is that by putting up the sign, they were asking for it. The author argues that the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food shouldn't be left outside.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. The author set up the sign to prevent knocking, which worked for packages. However, food delivery might require different instructions. The author didn't specify exceptions for food on the sign. The delivery person followed the given instructions literally. The author might have overlooked that food isn't a package and needs to be handled differently. Therefore, the mistake could be on the author for not considering that the sign might apply to food as well, leading to the problem. On the other hand, the delivery person might be at fault for not using judgment, but the sign was explicit.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She set up the sign in a way that caused the food to be left outside, which resulted in it being cold. She might have failed to communicate that food should be handled differently. But she also had a valid reason to avoid being knocked on the door. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the sign applied to all deliveries and didn't make an exception for food, the delivery person followed the instructions. The author's oversight in not specifying exceptions could make her at fault. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
