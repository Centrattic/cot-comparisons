I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages to avoid disturbing her baby. She got a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food delivery person left the dinner at the door, which was ice cold when they realized it was late. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was to prevent noise for the baby, so she used signs to stop delivery people from knocking. She took steps to communicate this through notes and the sign. However, when a food delivery came, the person followed the sign and left it outside, leading to a problem. \n\nNow, the key points here are: the author's signs were for packages, but the food delivery might be a different service. The sign had courier logos, maybe only for package services like Amazon, FedEx, etc. The food delivery person might not have been from those companies, so the sign didn't apply to them. But the person still left the food at the door without knocking. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her needs, but the food delivery person didn't use common sense. The author's signs were for packages, not food. The delivery person should have realized that the sign might not apply to food deliveries, which require a different protocol. The husband's comment that they asked for it is harsh because the sign was specific to packages. The food delivery person's mistake was not using judgment. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her request properly for the intended audience (package deliverers). The food delivery person should have recognized that the sign wasn't relevant to their service and adjusted accordingly. The problem is on the delivery person's side for not using common sense, not the author's. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
