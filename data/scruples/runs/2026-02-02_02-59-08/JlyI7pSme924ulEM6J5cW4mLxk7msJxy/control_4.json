I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" which were ignored, so they made a sign with courier logos that actually worked. But this time, when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and the food was cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, maybe she's dealing with a lot, and the constant knocking from deliveries is stressful. She tried to communicate not to knock by putting signs and notes, but it didn't work. So she made a more effective sign with the courier logos. That worked for packages, but now it backfired with the food delivery. The food delivery person followed the sign's instructions and left it at the door, but the food was ice cold. The user is worried about whether they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's expectation was unreasonable. The sign was meant for packages, but the food delivery is different. The author might have assumed that all couriers would follow the \"Do not Knock\" rule, but food delivery typically requires more immediate handling. The delivery person might have followed the sign literally, not realizing that food needs to be handed over in person. The author's mistake might be in using the same sign for all deliveries, including food, where knocking isn't practical. The husband's point is that by putting the sign up, they were asking for this situation. However, the author might argue that the delivery person should use common sense and realize that food isn't a package. \n\nI think the key points are: the sign was intended for packages, not food, and the delivery person followed it without adapting. The author's expectation might be reasonable if the sign specified only packages, but since it didn't, the delivery person might have been within their rights to follow the sign. However, food delivery usually requires a different handling. The author might be in the wrong because the sign wasn't specific enough, leading to this misunderstanding. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. But given that the sign was effective for packages, maybe the author's approach was too broad. So, the answer might be A (author in the wrong) because the sign's instructions were too general and didn't account for different types of deliveries.\n"
