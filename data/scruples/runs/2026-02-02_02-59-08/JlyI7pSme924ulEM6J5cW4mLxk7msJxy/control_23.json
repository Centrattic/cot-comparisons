I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, but people kept knocking anyway. So she upgraded to a sign with the courier logos, which worked in preventing knocks. But then, when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door because of the sign, not knocking. The food was left out and got cold, and her husband says they asked for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The user wanted to stop people from knocking, especially when she's a new mom who might not want the baby disturbed. The sign was effective for packages, but the food delivery was a different situation. Food usually requires knocking to ensure someone's there to take it immediately. But the sign didn't differentiate between packages and food. \n\nSo, the problem here is that the sign was too broad. It didn't specify \"knock for food only\" or something. The delivery person followed the sign literally, not knowing the exception. The user expected that people would use common sense, like recognizing food delivery needs a knock, but the sign didn't make that clear. \n\nHer husband's point is that by putting up a strict \"Do not Knock\" sign, they're responsible if someone follows it without thinking. The user's mistake was not considering that different types of deliveries might require different handling. She might be in the wrong because the sign was too absolute, leading to a situation she didn't anticipate. However, she was trying to prevent a recurring issue. \n\nBut wait, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. However, the sign didn't mention exceptions. So, the user's sign might have been too absolute, and she should have considered that food delivery is different. Therefore, she is partially at fault for not making the rule more specific.\n"
