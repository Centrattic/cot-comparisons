I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door.\n\nThe situation is that the author, a new mom, has a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" both physically and in delivery notes, but the delivery people kept knocking. So she got a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, making them not knock. But when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and it got cold. The author is upset, and her husband says they asked for it. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to want no knocking\u2014maybe a baby, so noise is disruptive. She tried multiple times to communicate this. But when it came to food delivery, the same sign that worked for packages (not knocking) led to a problem because food might need to be delivered hot.\n\nSo, maybe the author's sign was too broad. She didn't specify that it's only for packages, not food. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but it caused an issue. The author might be at fault for not making the distinction clear. On the other hand, the delivery person should use common sense, like knocking for food to ensure it's received properly. The author argues that common sense should apply, but the delivery person didn't use it. \n\nBut the sign was effective in stopping knocks for packages. However, food delivery is different. Maybe the author should have made separate instructions for food. Alternatively, the delivery person should recognize the difference between a package and a food order and adjust accordingly. \n\nThe husband's comment that they asked for it suggests he thinks they shouldn't have expected different treatment based on the type of delivery. The author might be in the wrong because she didn't specify that the \"Do not knock\" rule applies only to non-food packages. But the delivery person could also be at fault for not using judgment. \n\nHmm. But the author's main action was putting up a sign that worked for packages. When it came to food, the same sign caused a problem. The key is whether the sign was too vague. If the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries, the delivery person had no reason to treat them differently. So, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't clarify. Alternatively, the delivery person should have knocked regardless of the sign for food. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sign was unambiguous. If the sign only said \"Do not knock\" without context, then the delivery person is following instructions. But if the sign was intended for packages only, the author should have specified. Since the sign had courier logos and was for \"Do not knock,\" maybe it was clear it's for packages. However, the food delivery person might not have realized that. \n\nIn that case, the delivery person made an error. But the author's sign was a general instruction. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong for not making clear that it's only for non-food deliveries. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't specify, leading to an unintended consequence.\n"
