I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a new mom who's been getting a lot of packages. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in various places, but the delivery people kept knocking anyway. Then she got a sign with the corporate logos, which worked for packages but then caused a problem when someone left food at the door, which got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author wanted to prevent knocking for packages, so she put up signs. The signs were effective for packages but not for food delivery. The food delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, leading to it getting cold. The author now feels wronged because the food was left there, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sign was intended to prevent knocking for packages, but food delivery is different. The sign might have been interpreted as a general instruction not to knock for any deliveries, not just packages. So the food delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction literally, which caused the problem.\n\nThe author expected the delivery person to use common sense and realize that food is time-sensitive and needs to be delivered hot, hence needing to knock. But the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door. The author's husband said they were asking for it, which suggests he thinks the sign led to the problem. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she put up the sign with the intention to stop knocking for packages, which worked. But the sign might not have been specific enough. If the sign says \"Do not knock\" without specifying for which type of delivery, it could be misinterpreted. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction strictly, not considering that food is different. The author might have been negligent in not specifying that the no-knock rule applies only to packages, not to food. Therefore, she could be in the wrong for not being clear enough.\n\nBut another angle is that the delivery person should have used common sense. Food delivery is time-sensitive, so even if the sign says \"Do not knock,\" the delivery person might have realized that leaving food at the door could be a problem. However, the sign's presence might have made the delivery person think it's acceptable to leave it there without knocking.\n\nIn this case, the author's sign was effective for packages but not for food. The problem arises from ambiguity in the sign's instructions. The author might have been careless in not differentiating between package and food deliveries. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because she didn't specify the exception for food, leading to the unintended consequence.\n"
