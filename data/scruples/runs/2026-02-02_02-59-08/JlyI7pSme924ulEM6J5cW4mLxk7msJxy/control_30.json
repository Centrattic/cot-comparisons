I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a new mom with lots of packages. She used to have signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock. But even after writing that in the notes, they kept knocking. So she got a sign with courier logos that said \"Do not knock,\" and that worked for packages. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door without knocking. The food was cold when they found it later, and now the author is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the sign's purpose versus unintended consequences. The sign was meant for packages, not food deliveries. She mentioned that the sign had corporate logos, which might have made the delivery person think it applies to all deliveries. But she also said she used to specify \"Do not knock\" in the checkout notes, which the delivery people ignored. Now, with the sign working for packages, it's causing issues with food.\n\nSo, was the sign too generic? Maybe the delivery person didn't realize it was only for packages. The author's husband says they asked for it, implying that they should have been more specific. But the author might not have considered that food delivery would be affected. The question is whether she's at fault for expecting the sign to be followed in all cases, including food, which requires immediate attention.\n\nOn one hand, the sign was effective for packages, which don't need immediate attention. Food deliveries, however, typically require someone to be present to receive them promptly. The author didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, so the delivery person followed it. That could be seen as her not being clear enough. On the other hand, the delivery person should use common sense and realize that food delivery is different from packages. The author's husband's comment suggests he thinks they were asking for trouble by not being specific.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She might be partially at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. However, the delivery person also could have used better judgment by knocking to ensure the food was received warm. The balance here is tricky. Since the sign didn't specify, but food delivery is a different context, maybe the delivery person should have known. But the author might not have intended the sign to apply to food. It's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then she is. If B (no), then she isn't. Considering that the sign led to an unintended consequence because it wasn't specific, maybe she shares some responsibility. However, expecting common sense from the delivery person is also valid. The answer might depend on whether the sign's ambiguity is her fault. Since she had prior issues with delivery people not following her notes, maybe the sign was her best effort, but it still caused a problem. The delivery person should have used judgment. So perhaps she's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again. The sign had courier logos, implying it's for all deliveries. She didn't mention food vs. packages. So she might be responsible for not being clear. Therefore, the answer could be A. But others might argue B. Hmm.\n"
