I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. She had various signs, even one with logos, which worked for packages but failed with food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold. The husband said they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, especially as a new mom, which is understandable. She tried multiple methods to communicate this. The sign worked for packages, but when applied to food delivery, it led to an unintended consequence. The delivery person left the food outside, resulting in it being cold. \n\nNow, the key points here: The sign was meant for packages, but she used a version that included food delivery logos. By including the food delivery logos, she might have extended the rule to food deliveries too. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't use common sense to assess the situation. However, the sign was explicit, so the delivery person might have felt compelled to follow it. \n\nIs the author responsible for not considering that the same instruction might apply to food, which requires immediate handling? She might have overlooked that the sign's instruction conflicts with the nature of food deliveries. On the other hand, the delivery person should have exercised judgment to avoid leaving perishable items outside. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that using the sign for food deliveries was their fault. The author's perspective is that common sense should have overridden the sign. However, the sign was a clear instruction, and the delivery person might not have had the authority to ignore it. \n\nSo, who's to blame here? The author created a situation where a strict instruction led to an unintended problem. The delivery person followed the instruction but didn't adapt to the context. The answer hinges on whether the author should have anticipated the sign's application to food deliveries versus packages. Since the sign included food delivery logos, the author might be partially at fault for not differentiating. But the delivery person also didn't use judgment. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the question is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. She had a valid reason for not wanting to be disturbed, but the sign's universal application might have been a misstep. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not tailoring the sign to packages only, leading to the food mishap. However, the delivery person's strict adherence to the sign without discretion also plays a role. \n\nThe possible answer is A (author is in the wrong) because she extended the \"Do not Knock\" rule to food deliveries, expecting compliance without considering the perishable nature of food. The delivery person followed the instruction but didn't use common sense, but the author's sign setup might have been ambiguous. Therefore, the author shares some responsibility.\n"
