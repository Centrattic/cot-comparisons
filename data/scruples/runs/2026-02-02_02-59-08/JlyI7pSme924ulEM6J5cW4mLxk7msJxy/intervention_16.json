I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages because they didn't want deliveries to be left at the door. They tried various methods to communicate this, but the deliverers kept ignoring the instructions. Then they got a sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food came late and was left outside, resulting in it being ice cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent packages from being left at the door, which is understandable, especially for a new mom who might not be home to receive them. Using signs with the courier logos probably made the deliverers take notice, but it seems they applied the same rule to food deliveries. However, food delivery usually requires the recipient to be present to receive the item, especially hot food, which is time-sensitive. The author might not have considered that food delivery is different from regular packages. The deliverer followed the sign's instructions and left it at the door, but that led to a cold meal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did communicate their preference multiple times, so the deliverer might have been following orders. But maybe the author's sign was too broad, not differentiating between package deliveries and food. The deliverer might have assumed it was a package and followed the rule. However, common sense would suggest that hot food shouldn't be left outside. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They clearly communicated their preference, but perhaps didn't consider the difference between package and food delivery. The deliverer followed the instructions literally, but maybe should have used judgment. However, the author's sign didn't specify exceptions. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer depends on whether the author's instructions were reasonable. Since food delivery typically requires someone to be present, maybe the author should have made a distinction. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering that different types of deliveries require different handling.\n"
