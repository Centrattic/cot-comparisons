I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom with many packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want the door knocked. She tried various methods, like handwritten signs and notes in the delivery instructions, but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with courier logos that worked. But when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, she made clear her instructions not to knock for packages, which she needed as a new mom. She even used a sign with the courier's logos to ensure compliance. It worked for packages, but when it came to food delivery, the same instructions led to a problem because food delivery might require immediate attention. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which were for packages, not food, leading to the food being left out and getting cold.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have differentiated between package delivery and food delivery. The sign might have been too broad. If the sign included a note specifying that it's for packages only, maybe the issue wouldn't have happened. The food delivery person might not have realized that the instruction didn't apply to food. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the sign might have been too general.\n\nBut the user's intention was to prevent knocks on the door, which she had a valid reason for. The problem arose because the sign was effective but not specific. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which were meant for packages, but the food delivery required a different handling. So, maybe the error is on the delivery person's side for not recognizing the difference, but the user could have been more explicit in her instructions. However, she did mention in the delivery notes, but those were ignored. The sign worked too well, but maybe she needed to adjust it for different types of deliveries. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The user had a legitimate need to avoid knocks, and she tried multiple methods. The sign was effective but perhaps not specific enough. The delivery person followed the instructions, leading to an unintended consequence. So, is the user in the wrong? Probably not entirely, but maybe she could have been more specific. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the delivery person should have used common sense to distinguish between packages and food, but the user's intent was valid. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the sign was too broad. But given the context, the user's intention was to prevent knocks, and the sign worked as intended, so the delivery person's mistake was in applying the same rule to food. Hence, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
