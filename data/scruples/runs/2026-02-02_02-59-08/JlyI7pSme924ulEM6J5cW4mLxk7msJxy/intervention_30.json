I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. She had various signs, both handwritten and ones with company logos, and they worked for packages. But when she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and just left it at the door, which was cold. Now she's upset because the food was left outside and it was late.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's intention was to prevent package deliveries from knocking, which she didn't want because she's a new mom and maybe she wants peace. She used different methods to communicate this, which worked for packages. But food delivery is different. Food requires timely handling, so not knocking might be a problem because the customer can't be outside to receive it immediately. The delivery person left it at the door, leading to the food being cold. The husband says they asked for it, and the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author's signs were effective for packages but not for food. Food delivery usually expects the customer to be present to receive it, so maybe the author's signs were too broad. She might not have considered that food delivery is different from packages. The delivery person followed the sign but didn't realize that the food needed to be handed over personally. So maybe the author didn't consider the context-specific needs of food delivery. By using the same sign for all deliveries, she might have caused an unintended consequence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason for not wanting to be disturbed and used the delivery notes properly. But perhaps she should have made a distinction between packages and food deliveries. Maybe she didn't communicate that this sign was only for packages. The delivery person might not have known that the sign didn't apply to food, so they followed it literally. The author might be responsible for not clarifying the scope of the sign. \n\nThe husband's point is that they asked for it by putting up the signs. The author's common sense argument is that the delivery person should have known not to leave food outside. But maybe the delivery person can't be expected to second-guess the instructions, especially if they're following the sign. So, the responsibility could lie with the author for not providing instructions that account for different types of deliveries. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't consider that her instructions were too general and didn't account for the specific needs of food delivery. The answer could be A (Yes). But I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the sign was specific enough to packages, maybe not. But she used a sign with company logos that might have been interpreted as applying to all deliveries. Hmm. I think the key is that the author's instructions were too broad, leading to an unintended outcome. So the answer is A.\n"
