I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but people kept knocking anyway. Then she put up a sign with logos of the courier companies that says \"No knocking for packages,\" and that worked. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside, where it got cold. The author is upset about the food being cold, and her husband says they asked for it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's main issue was that delivery people were knocking, which as a new mom might be disruptive or stressful. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through notes and checkout messages, but it didn't work. So she used a more visual sign with the courier logos, which was effective for packages. However, the sign caused problems when a food delivery happened. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left the food outside, leading to it getting cold. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The sign was intended for packages, not food deliveries. The author might not have considered that food delivery requires someone to be present to receive it immediately, unlike packages. The sign's effectiveness for packages was good, but it caused an unintended consequence for food. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she was trying to manage her environment as a new mom, which can be overwhelming. She used a sign that worked for her main issue (packages not being knocked on). But the sign's broad message might have been too general, not distinguishing between food and packages. \n\nThe delivery person followed the instructions on the sign, which was to not knock. Since food delivery usually requires confirmation or someone to receive it, the delivery person might have assumed that the food could be left at the door, which is not standard procedure. The author's expectation that the delivery person should know not to follow the sign for food isn't communicated clearly. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The sign was effective for packages but didn't specify exceptions. The author might be responsible for not clearly differentiating between packages and food. On the other hand, the delivery person should have called to confirm if they can leave the food, even if the sign says not to knock. There's a mutual expectation here: the author expected the sign to guide all deliveries, while the delivery person might have expected the sign to apply only to packages. \n\nThe husband's comment that they asked for it suggests that the author's solution backfired. However, the author's intention was to stop knocking for packages. The problem is that the sign wasn't specific enough. Maybe the author should have included a note like \"No knocking for packages, please knock for food deliveries\" to distinguish. But she didn't, so the delivery person followed the sign. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's sign was the cause of the delivery person's action. However, the delivery person could have called to check, which is a standard practice for food deliveries. The author might be partially at fault for not anticipating that the sign would affect food deliveries, but the delivery person might also be at fault for not verifying. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer depends on whether the sign was ambiguous. If the sign didn't specify that it only applies to packages, then the author might be in the wrong for not clarifying. But if the sign's context is clear (like using package-related imagery), then the delivery person might be at fault. The sign in the image might have pictures of boxes, which are packages, so the delivery person might have assumed it only applies to packages. However, the text says \"Do not knock for any deliveries,\" which is a bit vague. \n\nIn the end, the sign worked for packages but not for food. The author didn't consider the different handling required for food. So, she might be in the wrong for not making the sign more specific. Alternatively, the delivery person should have called. Since the sign's message was a bit broad, the author shares some responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the sign was too general and caused an unintended consequence. However, if the sign's context was clear (only for packages), then it's B. But given the description, the sign might not have been clear enough. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
