I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in different ways, but the delivery people kept knocking. So she made a sign with courier logos that worked, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to cold food. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about the signs she put up. Initially, she wanted no knocking for packages, which is understandable if she's a new mom needing quiet. But when they ordered food, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, not realizing that food deliveries might require knocking to prevent spoilage. The author didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, not food. So, maybe she's at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. The delivery person followed the instructions as given, but the outcome was unintended. The husband's point is valid because she didn't make the exception clear. The author expected common sense, but maybe she should have considered that the sign might be too broad. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't account for different types of deliveries.\n"
