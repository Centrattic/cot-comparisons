I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. They're a new mom with a lot of packages. They've been putting up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because they don't want the delivery person to knock. They tried different versions of the sign and also wrote notes in the delivery options every time, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then they found a sign with corporate logos, which worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and it got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether the sign was too strict. The author wanted to prevent knocking because they're new parents, maybe with a baby, so noise could be disruptive. So they tried to make it clear through signs and notes. The sign they used had corporate logos, which might have been a bit confusing because maybe it's a company-specific sign, but they used it for their own purpose. The food delivery person followed the sign and left the food at the door, which caused the food to be cold. \n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, they were trying to communicate their preferences, which is reasonable. However, maybe the sign they used was misleading. If the sign was meant for packages and not food deliveries, but they used it for all deliveries, then maybe the food delivery person followed it even though it might not be intended for that kind of delivery. The author expected that the delivery person would use common sense and, despite the sign, knock for food because it's time-sensitive. But the sign didn't account for that scenario. \n\nBut wait, the author did specify \"Do not knock\" in the delivery notes for packages, and the food delivery person might not have seen those notes. The sign itself might not have been clear enough to differentiate between packages and food. So maybe the author's solution was too broad. Alternatively, the delivery person should have knocked anyway for food, even if the sign said not to. But in the situation described, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was the opposite of what the author wanted for food. \n\nThe husband's point is that they asked for it by putting up the sign. But the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they succeeded in for packages. However, food deliveries might require different handling. The author might not have considered that food delivery people would follow the same rules as package delivery. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the delivery person followed the sign literally. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author tried to communicate their preference multiple times but in a way that might not have been flexible enough for different types of deliveries. The delivery person, on the other hand, followed the instructions literally. But perhaps the author should have anticipated that food deliveries would need a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the delivery person should have assessed the situation and knocked despite the sign because food is time-sensitive. But if the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it, the fault might be on the author for not making an exception in their instructions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might have overgeneralized the sign, not considering that different types of deliveries might need different handling. But they were trying to communicate their preference to avoid noise, which is understandable. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that they didn't specify different instructions for food deliveries and the delivery person followed the sign as written could mean the author is not entirely at fault. However, the sign's effectiveness in different scenarios was a problem. \n\nHmm. I think the answer depends on whether the sign was appropriate for all delivery types. If the sign was meant for packages only and the food delivery person followed it, then the author might share some responsibility. But the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they succeeded in for packages. The problem arose because the sign wasn't specific. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to communicate their needs, but the delivery person's strict adherence to the sign without using common sense could be their fault. However, the author's sign might have been too ambiguous. \n\nI think the key here is that the author tried multiple times to communicate their preference, and the delivery person followed the instructions, but didn't use common sense. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the sign was misleading, then maybe the author is at least partially responsible. However, given the context, the author's actions seem reasonable, and the delivery person's failure to adapt is the main issue. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
