I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but delivery people kept knocking. She then put up a sign with corporate logos that said not to knock, and when a food delivery came, the person didn't knock, left the food on the door, which got cold. The husband says they're asking for it. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author wanted no knocking for packages, so she used signs. The food delivery person followed the sign and didn't knock. The problem is that the food was left outside and got cold. The key here is whether the sign applied to all deliveries or just packages. The sign had corporate logos, so maybe it was intended for package deliveries. But food delivery is different; people usually expect the delivery person to knock or call to avoid leaving food outside. \n\nThe author might have assumed the sign only applied to packages, but the delivery person didn't know that. However, the sign didn't specify packages vs. food. The delivery person might have followed the sign literally. The author expected common sense, but the delivery person might not have made that distinction. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author set up the sign without clarifying it's only for packages. The delivery person followed the instructions given. The husband's point is that they set up the sign, so they can't complain if it's followed. But the author might argue that food delivery is different. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault because the sign didn't specify. The delivery person wasn't to know the difference. However, the delivery person might also be expected to use some common sense for food. But if the sign said \"Do not knock\" generally, then they followed it. The question is whether the sign's instructions were clear. If the sign included all deliveries, then the author is in the wrong for not considering food. If the sign was only for packages, but the delivery person didn't know, maybe the delivery person is at fault. But the sign didn't specify. \n\nIn this case, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries, leading to the situation where the delivery person followed the sign and left the food outside. The author didn't provide clear instructions for all delivery types. So, the answer is A.\n"
