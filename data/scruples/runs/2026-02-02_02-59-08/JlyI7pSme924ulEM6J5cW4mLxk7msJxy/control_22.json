I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door even though she kept putting signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" Eventually, she used a sign with courier logos that worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door, and the food was cold. The husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" but the author feels it's not their fault.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author's intention was to avoid disturbances, especially since she's a new mom. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference, but it wasn't working, leading her to use a more visual sign. The sign worked for packages, but not for food. The delivery person followed the sign by not knocking, but that's not the same as delivering the food properly. \n\nOn the other hand, food delivery usually requires more immediate handling. Leaving the food outside could lead to it getting cold or spoiled, which affects the customer's experience. The delivery person might have been following the sign's instruction but didn't consider the perishable nature of the item. The author's sign was for packages, but maybe the food delivery should have been handled differently. \n\nHowever, the author did try to communicate her preferences and the sign worked as intended. The delivery person might not have considered the context of the item being delivered. The husband's point is that the sign was the reason, but the author's main issue is that the delivery person didn't use common sense. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's main goal was to avoid disturbances, which the sign achieved. The problem arose because the sign was applied to a different type of delivery (food vs. packages). The delivery person followed the instructions but missed the nuance. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a lesson here about specific instructions for different types of deliveries. The key is whether the sign's instructions were too broad. Since the author's intent was to prevent knocking, and the delivery person did that, but the outcome was unintended, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's actions were a reasonable attempt to manage deliveries, so she's not the asshole.\n"
