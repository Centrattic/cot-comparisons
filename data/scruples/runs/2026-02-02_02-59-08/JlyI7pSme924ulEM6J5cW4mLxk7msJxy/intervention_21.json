I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. They've put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" in various forms, but the delivery people keep knocking. Finally, they created a sign with the courier logos that worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking and just left packages at the door. But then, when ordering dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door, and it got cold. The author is upset about that, and the husband says they asked for it. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author's intention was to prevent delivery people from knocking, which they did successfully with the sign. However, the sign might have led to unintended consequences, like the food delivery being left outside, which is against the user's wishes for hot food. \n\nBut wait, the sign specifically mentions food delivery? Let me check the link. Since the link is to an image, I can't see it, but the user says the sign had corporate courier logos. Maybe the sign is for all deliveries, not just food. The author might not have differentiated between packages and food orders. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction and left it at the door, leading to the food being cold. The author didn't make it clear that food should be handled differently. \n\nIs the author in the wrong here? They created a rule that worked for packages but didn't consider that food deliveries require someone to be present to accept them. The author might have been too generalized with the sign, failing to specify exceptions. The delivery person followed the instructions, so maybe it's the author's fault for not making an exception. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food needs to be handed over. But the author argues that common sense should prevail, but the delivery person followed the posted instructions. \n\nHmm. The key question is whether the author's instructions were too broad. If the sign said \"Do not knock,\" but didn't specify that food deliveries should knock or be brought to the door, then the author might be in the wrong for not providing clear exceptions. On the other hand, delivery people might reasonably assume that food needs to be handed over, but the sign didn't make that clear. So the author's instructions were ambiguous, leading to the problem. \n\nTherefore, maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering the different needs of food versus packages. However, the delivery person strictly followed the instructions, which the author insisted on. But since food delivery is different, perhaps the author should have made an exception. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their judgment. \n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. If the author's signs were clear and specific, maybe they're not in the wrong. But since the sign worked \"too well,\" even for food, leading to the problem, the author might have been too vague. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't account for different types of deliveries.\n"
