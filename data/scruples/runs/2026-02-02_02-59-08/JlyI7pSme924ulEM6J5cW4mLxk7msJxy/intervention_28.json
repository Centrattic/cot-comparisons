I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new mom who has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions not to. She tried multiple methods\u2014handwritten signs, notes in delivery options\u2014none of which worked. Eventually, she used a sign with corporate logos that worked, but then a food delivery left the package at the door, which got cold.\n\nThe author's husband says they were asking for it, while she argues common sense should've been used. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocks, which is understandable, especially for a new mom needing rest. She took steps to communicate this. The sign worked for regular packages, but the food delivery person didn't follow up. The problem here is that leaving frozen food at the door caused an issue. But was the sign too ambiguous? The sign might have been misinterpreted as not needing any interaction, but maybe the delivery person should've realized that food needs to be handed directly.\n\nHowever, the author didn't specify that the rule applied only to packages, not food. The sign's effectiveness for packages worked too well, leading to the unintended consequence. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction to avoid knocking, even if it wasn't safe for food. The author's responsibility is to communicate her needs clearly. Since she didn't clarify the exception for food, maybe she's at fault for not being specific. On the other hand, the delivery person should've used better judgment. Common sense might require delivering food directly despite the sign. But the author can't reasonably expect all couriers to ignore explicit instructions unless there's an exception. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the author made a mistake in not specifying the sign's exceptions, so she's partially in the wrong. But the delivery person also should've assessed the situation. However, since the question is about the author's responsibility, the answer leans towards A.\n"
