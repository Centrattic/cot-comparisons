I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for package deliveries. She had various versions of this sign, but people kept knocking anyway. So she got a new sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked in that the delivery person didn't knock, but left the food delivery at the door in the cold.\n\nThe person is asking if she's the asshole (AITA) for expecting the delivery person to not knock but then being upset when the food was left outside. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are: she had signs that were ignored, so she tried a more effective one with courier logos. The sign worked in that the delivery person didn't knock, but the consequence was the food being left outside and getting cold. The question is whether she's at fault for this outcome.\n\nOn one hand, she was clear with her instructions about not wanting to be disturbed, which is reasonable, especially as a new mom. She tried various methods to communicate this. The sign with the logos worked, but maybe she didn't consider that food deliveries might require a different handling. Packages can be left at the door, but food is perishable and needs to be kept warm. So maybe her sign didn't specify that for food items. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, but that led to a problem with the food.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered properly. Even if the sign says not to knock, the delivery person should use common sense to ensure the food isn't wasted. Maybe the delivery person should have contacted the customer or found another way to hand it over without knocking. But the sign might have implied that no interaction was wanted at all, which the delivery person took literally.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if her actions led to an unreasonable expectation. She wanted no knocking, which is reasonable for packages, but food is different. She might have been expecting the delivery person to follow the sign's instruction without considering the specific needs of a food delivery. Alternatively, maybe the sign should have had exceptions for food, but she didn't specify that.\n\nIn the end, the author's sign worked as intended (no knocking), but the consequence was a cold meal. The question is whether she's responsible for not anticipating that food delivery would be an exception. If the sign was general, maybe she didn't think about that. But she might not have been in the wrong for following through on her instructions unless there was a way to communicate that food is an exception. Since she didn't do that, maybe she is partially at fault. However, the delivery person also has a duty to handle food properly, so maybe the fault isn't entirely hers. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The husband says they were asking for it, implying that she's responsible for the sign leading to the problem. The user is leaning towards A (author is wrong), but I need to see if that's justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A because she set up a sign that led to the food being left out, which she didn't want. She should have considered that the sign might apply to all deliveries, including food, and maybe needed a separate note for food. Therefore, she's partly at fault for not specifying. But the delivery person also should have used judgment. However, in the context of AITA, the focus is on the author's actions. Since she created the sign that caused the issue, maybe she's in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
