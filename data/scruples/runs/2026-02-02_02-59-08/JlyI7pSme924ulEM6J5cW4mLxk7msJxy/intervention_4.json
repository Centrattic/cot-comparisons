I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new mom who's frustrated with delivery people knocking on her door despite her repeated instructions not to. She uses a sign with company logos to stop them from knocking, which works for packages but causes a problem when a food delivery is left outside in the cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had tried multiple times without success. Using the sign was effective for packages, so she probably thought it was a good solution. However, food deliveries require prompt handling, especially hot food. The delivery person left it outside, leading to it being cold. \n\nThe key points here are the purpose of the sign. The sign was made for packages, not food. The author might not have considered that food and packages are different in terms of handling. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't realize the food needed to be taken immediately. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that maybe the sign's use was too broad. The author might have overgeneralized the instruction, not accounting for the exception with food. However, the author's main concern was safety, especially as a new mom, possibly to avoid disturbing a baby or being disturbed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, did the author overstep by using a sign that could lead to unintended consequences? Or was the delivery person supposed to use common sense despite the sign? The author argues that common sense should prevail, but the delivery person might have followed protocol strictly. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because she created a rule (no knocking) that worked for packages but didn't account for the difference with food deliveries. She should have specified exceptions. However, the delivery person also could have used judgment to check if the food was time-sensitive. \n\nBut the question is about the author's responsibility. Since she didn't specify that the sign applies only to packages and not food, leading to a negative outcome, she might share some blame. However, she did try multiple times to communicate her needs. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because her intention was to follow the delivery instructions, and the delivery person's action was a misinterpretation. However, maybe she should have been more explicit. Hmm.\n"
