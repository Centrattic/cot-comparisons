I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is a new mom with a lot of packages. They put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because they don't want delivery people to knock while they're with the baby. But the delivery people kept knocking despite the signs. So they made a new sign with the company logos, which worked in stopping the knocks. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent delivery people from knocking, which they did because they don't want to disturb the baby. That's understandable, especially as a new mom. They tried multiple times to communicate this with signs and delivery notes. But when the food delivery person followed the sign literally and left it at the door without any communication, the food was cold. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author reasonably communicate their preference, and was there an expectation for common sense? The sign was effective for packages, but food delivery might be different. Packages can be left without issue, but food requires more care, like ensuring it's delivered hot. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, so they just left it, but maybe they should have used their judgment to check if the recipient wanted to take the food immediately. \n\nHowever, the author did specify \"Do not knock\" in the delivery notes, so technically, they followed the instructions. But maybe the author didn't consider that food delivery is different from packages. So the problem is that the author's instructions were clear but perhaps not considering the specific needs of food delivery, which might require a different approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have called or used another method to communicate that the food was there. But if the sign said not to knock, maybe they felt they couldn't. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't account for the fact that food needs to be handled differently. However, they might argue that they were trying to protect their baby's environment, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's instructions were reasonable given the context. If the sign was intended to stop knocks, but food delivery requires more interaction, then maybe the author's approach was too broad. They didn't specify different instructions for different types of deliveries. Hence, they might be at fault for not making a distinction. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food can't just be left outside. \n\nBut the author did mention \"Do not knock\" in the food order's delivery notes as well. So the delivery person followed those instructions literally. The husband's point is that they asked for it by being too strict. The author's defense is that common sense should have been used. But common sense can vary. \n\nIn the end, the author's instructions were clear and followed, leading to an unintended consequence. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because they communicated their preferences, but they might not have considered the nuances between packages and food. However, the delivery person also could have made a judgment call. But the question is about the author's responsibility. If the instructions were too strict without exceptions, then they might be in the wrong. But if they made it clear not to knock, then perhaps the delivery person is not at fault either. \n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. However, given that the author's instructions were followed and the issue was not with the delivery person's actions but with the outcome, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But they could have anticipated that food delivery might need a different approach. So the answer might hinge on whether the author's instructions were reasonable. If the sign was too general, then maybe they are at fault. But if they specified \"Do not knock\" for all deliveries, including food, then the delivery person did as instructed. \n\nI think the author's mistake was not differentiating between package deliveries and food deliveries. Food requires immediate attention, so the instructions might not be appropriate for that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the different needs of food delivery. So the answer would be A.\n"
