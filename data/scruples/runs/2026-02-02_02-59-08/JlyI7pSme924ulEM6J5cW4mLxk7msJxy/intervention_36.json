I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs up saying \"Do not knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking and startling her baby. But when a food delivery person left the cold food at the door instead of knocking, it was ice cold by the time they got it. The author says she expected them to use common sense, but her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had clear instructions not to knock for packages, which worked for packages but not for food. The food delivery person followed the sign and didn't knock, leading to the food being left outside and cooling down. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting the food to be brought up and not left outside, despite her own instructions.\n\nThe author had signs for packages, which the delivery people followed. However, food delivery might be different. Food is time-sensitive and needs to be warm or kept at a certain temperature. The sign might not have specified food deliveries, leading the courier to follow the general \"do not knock\" instruction. The author might have assumed that the instruction applied only to packages, not food. But the courier didn't differentiate and left the food outside. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not making it clear that \"do not knock\" applies only to packages and not to food? Or is the courier in the wrong for not using common sense to bring the food up even without being asked? The author's husband thinks they were asking for it, meaning they knew the sign might cause issues but still put it up. The author argues that common sense should have been used.\n\nI think the key is whether the sign was specific enough. If the sign only said \"Do not knock\" without differentiating between packages and food deliveries, then the courier followed instructions as given. But food delivery is a different service from package delivery. The author might have expected that food delivery people would knock regardless, but the courier adhered strictly to the sign. However, leaving food outside could be unsafe or unsanitary. The author's instructions might not have covered this scenario, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering that the sign could affect food deliveries differently. Alternatively, the courier should have used common sense. But since the sign was there, maybe the author should have realized that food might be left outside. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the sign was too vague. If the author didn't specify that food should be brought up, then maybe she's at fault for not being clear. But if the courier should have known that food requires a different approach, then the courier is at fault. Given the information, the author's instructions led to the problem, so maybe she's in the wrong.\n"
