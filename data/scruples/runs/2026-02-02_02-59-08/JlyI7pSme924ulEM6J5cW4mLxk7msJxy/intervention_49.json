I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up a sign saying not to knock, which worked for packages but not for a food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author had clear instructions not to knock, which were ignored before. She then used a more visible sign with courier logos, which was effective for packages. However, when a food delivery came, the person didn't knock and left it outside, leading to a cold meal. \n\nThe key points here are the intent of the author. She wanted to avoid disturbances, especially as a new mom. The sign was meant to prevent people from knocking, but she might not have considered that food deliveries need to be handled differently because they require prompt attention. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which the author intended for packages, but food needs to be delivered hot or quickly. \n\nSo, the author's sign was effective but maybe too broad. She might have not specified that food deliveries are an exception. The delivery person probably followed the sign as written, not realizing the food needed immediate attention. The author's mistake could be not differentiating between packages and food deliveries in her instructions. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have used better judgment. Even though the sign says not to knock, leaving a hot meal at the door for 45 minutes might not be reasonable. But maybe the sign was too strict, and there's an expectation that food deliveries are handled with urgency. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the sign caused the problem. The author's intention was good, but the execution might have overlooked the needs of food deliveries. So, the author might be in the wrong for not making exceptions or for creating a sign that's too rigid without considering different types of deliveries.\n"
