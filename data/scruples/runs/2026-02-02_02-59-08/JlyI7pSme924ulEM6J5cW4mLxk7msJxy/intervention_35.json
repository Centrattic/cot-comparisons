I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new mom who had previously asked delivery people not to knock by using signs and notes. But when she later ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, causing it to be cold. The author is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author had clear instructions not to knock, which were ignored before. So she created a more effective sign with company logos to ensure compliance. When it worked for packages, but then a food delivery followed the same instruction, leading to a problem. The key point here is whether it was reasonable to expect the food delivery person to follow the same instruction, even though food delivery might require knocking to prevent spoilage.\n\nThe author's husband said they were asking for it, implying that they shouldn't have used such a sign if they were going to order food. The author argues that common sense should prevail, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be delivered hot and thus needed knocking. \n\nNow, considering the options: is the author at fault? The sign was effective for packages, but food delivery is different. The author might have set up a rule that's reasonable for packages but not for food. If the sign didn't specify exceptions for food, then maybe she didn't account for that. However, the delivery person might have assumed that the sign applied to all deliveries, including food. \n\nOn the other hand, common sense would dictate that food delivery requires knocking to ensure timely delivery and to prevent the food from getting cold. So the delivery person might have been at fault for not using judgment in this case. However, the sign was clear, and the delivery person followed it to the letter without considering the context. \n\nThe author's intention was to prevent unnecessary noise, but she might not have considered that different types of deliveries have different needs. Her sign didn't differentiate between packages and food. So maybe she's in the wrong because she didn't account for the different requirements of food delivery. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sign was too broad. If the sign didn't specify exceptions, maybe the author is at fault for not being clear. But if the delivery person should have known better, then the blame is on them. However, since the sign was effective for packages, the delivery person might have followed it without question. So the author didn't explicitly state that food deliveries should be an exception, leading to the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
