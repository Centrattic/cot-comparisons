I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a new mom who's getting a lot of deliveries. She keeps putting signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" because she doesn't want delivery people to knock when dropping off packages, probably because she's a new mom and needs quiet or doesn't want to disturb her baby or something. But the delivery people keep ignoring her instructions. Then she puts up a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. She had clear instructions not to knock for packages, but food is different. Maybe people expect food to be handed directly to them, so knocking makes sense there. The husband thinks they're asking for it because the sign was there. The mom argues common sense should prevail, but the delivery person followed the sign literally.\n\nI think the key points are: 1. She put up a sign that worked for packages. 2. Food delivery is different from packages\u2014people usually want the food hot, so leaving it at the door could cause it to cool. 3. The delivery person might not differentiate between packages and food, just seeing a sign that says not to knock. 4. Did she specify that the sign was for packages only? The sign has courier logos, maybe implying it's for deliveries but not food? Not sure. The sign's description says it worked too well for food. Maybe she didn't make it clear that the no-knock rule was only for packages. If the sign didn't specify, then the delivery person might not know. The problem is that the delivery person followed the instructions literally, but the result was bad (cold food). So was it her fault for not making the instructions clear enough? Or is the delivery person supposed to use common sense and realize that food needs to be handed over? The mom's husband says they were asking for it, so he sides with the delivery person. The mom thinks common sense should prevail. But common sense might vary\u2014some might think not knocking is fine for packages but not for food. So maybe the author didn't communicate the nuance properly. If she had a sign that said \"No knock for packages, knock for food\" that would be better. Since she didn't, the delivery person followed the instruction, leading to a problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not clarifying the different handling between packages and food. But then again, maybe the delivery person should have known that food is different. But the sign didn't specify. So the answer is maybe A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't make the instructions clear, leading to an unintended consequence. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because she followed all the steps to not have people knock, and the delivery person ignored the context. Hmm. I think the key is that she didn't specify that the no-knock rule was only for packages. So the delivery person followed the sign, but the problem arose because the sign wasn't specific. Therefore, she's in the wrong for not clarifying.\n"
