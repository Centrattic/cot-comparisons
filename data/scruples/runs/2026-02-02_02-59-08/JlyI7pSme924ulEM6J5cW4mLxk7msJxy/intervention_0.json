I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages, so they put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid having delivery people make noise while they're trying to care for their baby. But the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So they put up a sign with the courier logos, and that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, it was cold, and they're upset about that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if others agree. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to reduce noise for their newborn. That's understandable. They tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through notes and signs. The problem is that the sign they used might have been misinterpreted. The sign had the courier logos, maybe indicating where to leave packages. But when a food delivery person saw the sign, they followed it and left the food at the door without knocking. Since food needs to be hot, this was an issue.\n\nDid the author have a right to expect that food delivery would follow the same rules as package delivery? Food delivery is different. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive and temperature-sensitive. The sign might not have been specific enough. The author might have assumed that all deliveries, including food, should follow the same instructions, but food delivery people are usually expected to knock to ensure the food is received hot. The author's sign didn't specify that food should be handled differently. So, maybe the author didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid reason to avoid noise. They tried multiple times to communicate their request. However, the solution they implemented (a sign without specific instructions for food) might have been too broad. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, leading to a problem. The author might be at fault for not making the instructions clear enough for different types of deliveries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had good intentions, but maybe the sign wasn't clear enough. The delivery person was following the sign's instructions, so the problem stemmed from ambiguous communication. The author's husband even said they were asking for it, suggesting that they shouldn't have put up such a sign. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that the sign's instructions weren't specific enough and led to unintended consequences. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
