I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door, which she doesn't want because she's a new parent. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock,\" both handwritten and in the delivery notes, but they were ignored. So she got a sign with corporate logos to get attention, which worked for packages but then caused a problem when a food delivery left the meal at the door, making it cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she had a valid reason for. Using a sign with company logos might have been effective for non-food packages, but food deliveries require timely handling. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but the result was a cold meal. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, she clearly communicated her preference not to be knocked on, which is her right. She tried multiple times to convey this, and the sign worked as intended. On the other hand, food deliveries are different from packages. Leaving perishable food at the door, especially when it's cold, could lead to issues. Maybe she should have considered that the sign might affect food deliveries differently. However, the sign didn't specify to leave food in a certain way; it just said not to knock. The delivery person did follow the instruction but without understanding the context of the food's perishability.\n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it might be his way of pointing out that the solution had unintended consequences. But the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. However, common sense can vary. The delivery person might not have realized that the food would be affected. The author might not be in the wrong because she communicated her request, and the delivery person followed it as instructed. The problem here is that the solution (the sign) was effective but didn't account for different types of deliveries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but perhaps she should adjust her sign to specify handling for food. But based on the current info, the answer would lean towards her not being the asshole, so B.\n"
