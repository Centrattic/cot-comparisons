I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to not knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had previously had packages left at the door without knocking by using signs that said \"Do Not Knock.\" However, when they ordered dinner and the same sign was up, the delivery person left the food at the door, resulting in it being cold and late. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the key point is the sign. The author had a sign that said \"Do Not Knock\" with courier logos. The delivery person saw it and didn't knock, but left the food at the door. The problem is that the food was supposed to be delivered with the expectation that the recipient is present to receive it, especially for food which can go cold. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they had done for packages. But food deliveries typically require the recipient to be present to accept it, unlike packages that can be left out. The sign might not have specified that food should be kept warm and left at the door, so the delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock and left it there. \n\nThe author's mistake was using the same sign for different types of deliveries. The sign was effective for packages but not appropriate for food. The delivery person followed the instruction literally, leading to the problem. The author didn't specify that food should be kept warm or require a different handling. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" might be justified here because the sign didn't account for the difference between packages and food. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the sign was a direct instruction without exceptions. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't clarify that the \"Do Not Knock\" sign applied to packages only, not food deliveries. They should have adjusted the sign or added a note for food. The delivery person followed the given instruction without realizing the consequence. So, the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
