I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking on her door. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes on packages and delivery options, but it didn't work. So she made a more visible sign with the courier logos, which worked but then caused a problem. When they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's main issue is that the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being cold. The key points are whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to knock despite her own signs, or if the delivery person should have used their judgment.\n\nThe author tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not Knock,\" which might imply that she wants deliveries left without knocking. However, food is different from packages\u2014it's perishable and time-sensitive. The sign worked for packages but not for food, which is a different context. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, perhaps not considering that the food needed to be handed over immediately. \n\nThe author's responsibility might be in not differentiating between package delivery and food delivery in her instructions. The delivery person might have done what was asked, but the author's request was not considering the nature of food delivery. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense and knocked anyway to hand over the food, even if the sign said not to. \n\nThe husband's comment that they \"asked for it\" suggests that the author's sign caused the problem. But the author argues that common sense should prevail. There's a conflict between following explicit instructions and using situational judgment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author may not be entirely at fault because the delivery person might have misinterpreted the sign's application. However, by putting up the sign, she might have set a rule that the delivery person followed to the letter, which led to the issue. But food delivery typically requires handover, so expecting the delivery person to knock might be reasonable in that context. \n\nSo the answer would depend on whether the sign's instructions applied to all deliveries or just packages. If the sign's purpose was to prevent noise from packages, but food requires immediate handover, the author's sign might not have been clear. The delivery person might have done what the sign said, but the author didn't consider that food delivery is different. Therefore, the author's fault could be in not specifying exceptions for food. However, the delivery person also should have used judgment. But since the question is about the author's fault, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the sign's intent was for packages, not food. Alternatively, since the sign was general, the author is partially at fault for not making it clear.\n"
