I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a new mom and get a lot of packages. They've been putting up signs that say \"Do not Knock\" to avoid people knocking when they're not home, maybe to leave packages. But the delivery people kept ignoring those signs. Then they got a more noticeable sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door even though it was a food delivery that needed to be warm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They wanted to prevent knocking, probably because they were busy or couldn't answer the door. They tried multiple times to communicate this, but the previous signs weren't respected. Then they used a more explicit sign, which worked for packages. However, the problem arose when it was a food delivery that required a different handling\u2014like not leaving it outside where it could get cold.\n\nThe key here is whether the sign was too broad. The author's sign might have been interpreted as a general instruction for all deliveries, not just packages. But food deliveries typically require the person to knock or call to ensure the food is handed over while it's hot. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, leading to a cold meal. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they tried to communicate their preference, but maybe didn't specify exceptions. The sign might have been ambiguous. The delivery person was following the instruction, but the outcome was unintended. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" might be valid because the sign's message was too broad. However, the author might not have considered that food deliveries are different from packages. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have used common sense to realize that food needs to be delivered hot and shouldn't be left outside. But if the sign explicitly says not to knock, maybe the delivery person had no choice but to follow it. The author might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to manage deliveries, but perhaps they should have made a distinction between package and food deliveries. However, since the sign worked for packages and failed for food, the problem is more about ambiguous communication rather than being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No) because the author's intention wasn't malicious, but they failed to consider the specific needs of food deliveries. However, the delivery person should also use judgment. But in the context of the question, whether the author is in the wrong, the answer leans towards B.\n"
