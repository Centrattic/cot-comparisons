I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a new mom, getting a lot of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but the delivery people kept knocking anyway. Then they tried a different sign with the corporate logos, and it worked for packages\u2014delivery people didn't knock and left them at the door. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the delivery people ignored their instructions for packages. They tried multiple ways to communicate \"no knocking,\" but it didn't work until they used the logo-based sign. That worked for packages, but not for the food delivery. The problem is that the food was left outside and got cold. The author expects the delivery person to use common sense and maybe knock for food, even if packages are left at the door. But the delivery person didn't knock, assuming the same rule applies. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author made it clear for packages, but maybe food is different. Food delivery services might have different protocols, and perhaps the delivery person was following the same instructions meant for packages. But the author didn't specify that the \"Do not Knock\" sign only applies to packages, not food. The sign with the corporate logos might have been interpreted as a general rule for all deliveries, including food. \n\nThe author's mistake could be not differentiating between packages and food in their instructions. They might have assumed that delivery people would understand the context. However, the delivery person might not know that food is different from packages. So, the responsibility could be on both sides. The delivery person should maybe ask if it's food, but the author might have been clearer in their instructions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified because they tried multiple times to get the message through for packages, and the same sign was applied to food deliveries by mistake. The delivery person didn't check if the delivery type was different. In that case, the delivery person is at fault for not using common sense when delivering food, which is perishable and needs to be handed directly. \n\nBut the author didn't specify that the sign was only for packages. So maybe they didn't make their expectations clear enough. The husband's point is that they were asking for it by using a sign that led to unintended consequences. The author's expectation that common sense would prevail might not be realistic if they didn't communicate the nuance between package and food deliveries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might share some responsibility for not being explicit about which types of deliveries the \"Do not Knock\" rule applies to. However, the delivery person could also be expected to recognize that food delivery is different. It's a bit of a grey area. But since the author didn't differentiate in their sign, they might be partially at fault. Therefore, answer A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong)? \n\nHmm. If the sign didn't specify, but the delivery person applied the same rule to food, maybe the author is at fault for not being clear. However, if the delivery person should have known food requires different handling, then the author isn't at fault. The answer depends on whether the author's instructions were unambiguous. Since the sign was for corporate couriers (maybe like FedEx, UPS), but the food delivery is through a different service (like DoorDash, Uber Eats), perhaps the author didn't account for that. The sign might have been specific to package delivery services, not food delivery apps. So the author might have made an assumption that the food delivery person would follow the same instructions, which they shouldn't have. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not considering that different delivery services might have different protocols. So answer A.\n"
