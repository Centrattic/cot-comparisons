I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages delivered. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door even though she's put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in different formats. She also tried adding that note in the delivery instructions during checkout every time. But the delivery people kept knocking. Frustrated, she got a sign with pictures of the couriers' logos (like the ones in the link provided, which I can't see but probably shows the logos of various delivery companies). The idea was to get the drivers to leave packages without knocking. It worked for the packages, but when they ordered dinner and the driver saw the sign, he left it at the door without knocking. The food was cold when they found it later. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's intentions. She wanted to prevent deliveries from being dropped off at the door and then having the driver knock, which might disturb her as a new mom. She tried multiple times to communicate \"no knocking\" through various signs and notes. The problem is that when the sign worked too well, it caused an issue with food delivery. \n\nThe key here is that the sign's purpose was to stop drivers from knocking, which it did. But food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left at the door without issue, but food requires timely delivery. The driver left the food at the door without knocking, causing it to be cold. The author expected that the driver would use judgment and knock anyway for food, but the sign didn't specify that. The sign was general, applying to all deliveries, not distinguishing between packages and food.\n\nThe author might have assumed that common sense would make the driver knock for something time-sensitive like food. However, the sign didn't make that distinction. The driver followed the instructions literally, which led to the problem. The author's instructions were clear (don't knock), but they didn't account for exceptions. \n\nFrom the delivery person's perspective, they followed the rules set by the customer. They had been told not to knock for packages, so when they saw the sign, they adhered to it. However, food delivery is different because it's perishable and needs to be received quickly. The driver might not have known that the sign was meant only for packages, not food. The author's sign didn't specify this, so the driver had no reason to think otherwise.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was creating a general rule without exceptions. She expected the delivery person to use common sense, but her instructions were explicit, which the driver followed. Therefore, she's in the wrong because she didn't communicate the exception for food deliveries. She should have made a separate note for food orders or adjusted the sign to indicate that food is an exception. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the driver should have used judgment, but the sign was clear. The responsibility was on the customer to provide clear instructions, which she didn't do in this case. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
