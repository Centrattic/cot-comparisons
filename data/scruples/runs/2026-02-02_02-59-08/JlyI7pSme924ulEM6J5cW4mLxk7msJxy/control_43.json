I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of packages. She's been using signs that say \"Do not knock\" to avoid the courier knocking, which she doesn't want. The signs worked for packages, but then there was a food delivery. The delivery person ignored the sign, left the food at the door, which got cold. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the sign was meant for packages, not food. Maybe she didn't specify that. The sign with corporate logos might have been clear enough, but perhaps the delivery person didn't realize food deliveries were different. But she had a sign that said \"Do not knock\" in general. If the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries, then the delivery person followed it literally, which caused the problem. So, maybe the sign was ambiguous. She might be at fault for not making it clear that the \"Do not knock\" instruction applies only to packages, not food. Alternatively, the delivery person should use common sense and knock for food, but the sign says not to. The husband's comment suggests he thinks they were asking for it. The user thinks common sense should prevail. But if the sign is explicit, then the delivery person might follow it regardless. So, maybe the author's sign was too broad. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not clarifying the exceptions.\n"
