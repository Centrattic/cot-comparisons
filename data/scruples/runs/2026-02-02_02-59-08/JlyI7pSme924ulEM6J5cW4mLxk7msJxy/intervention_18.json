I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's been putting up signs that say \"Do not knock\" to prevent the delivery people from knocking, which she probably doesn't want because she's busy with a baby, maybe doesn't want to be disturbed, or it's inconvenient. But the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she found a sign with the courier logos that made them not knock, which worked. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold. Now she's upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intent was to stop the knocking, which she had tried multiple times by writing notes. The problem is that when it worked for packages, it also applied to food delivery. The delivery person didn't knock, left the food outside, leading to it being cold. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to use common sense and maybe knock for food even if the sign said not to.\n\nThe sign was general, using courier logos, so maybe the delivery person assumed it applied to all deliveries, including food. The author might not have made the distinction clear between packages and food. If the sign didn't specify that it's only for packages, then the delivery person's action wasn't wrong. On the other hand, the author might have expected that food is different from packages, but maybe that's an assumption. The delivery person followed the instructions given, which were not to knock, so they did what was asked. The author might have been careless in not specifying that the sign applies only to packages, not food. Alternatively, the delivery person could have used common sense to realize that leaving food outside would be inappropriate, but maybe that's too much to expect if the sign explicitly said not to knock. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks the sign led to the problem. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed. It's a bit of a tricky situation. The key is whether the author's sign was ambiguous. If the sign was meant for packages only, she should have made that clear. If she didn't specify, then the delivery person followed the instructions as given. So maybe the author is at fault for not being specific. On the other hand, the delivery person should know that food deliveries typically require someone to be present to receive them, so not knocking might be against standard practice. But if the sign explicitly says not to knock, they might be bound by the customer's instructions. \n\nI think it's a bit of both, but the main issue is the sign's ambiguity. If the author didn't clarify that it's only for packages, then she's partially at fault. But the delivery person might also have a responsibility to ensure the food is delivered properly. However, if they followed the written instructions without question, that's their mistake. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because the sign wasn't specific enough. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used discretion. Hmm.\n"
