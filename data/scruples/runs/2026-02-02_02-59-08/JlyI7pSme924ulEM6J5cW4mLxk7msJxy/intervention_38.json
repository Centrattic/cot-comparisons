I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author is a new mom with lots of packages. They used signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, which worked. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband says they're asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should apply.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about the signs. The author had specific instructions for packages, but the food delivery is different. The sign might have been misinterpreted. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, which is what the author asked for for packages. But food delivery usually requires knocking to hand it over, unlike packages. The author might not have considered that the sign applies to packages only, not food. So the delivery person did what they were told, but it wasn't the right action for a food order. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they used a sign that's meant for packages, not food, and didn't specify. They expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the instructions were clear, even if they were for a different context. So the delivery person followed the literal instruction, which was not ideal. Therefore, the author's lack of clarity led to the problem. Answer A.\n"
