I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, wants to avoid knocks on the door for deliveries because maybe she's with the baby or something. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with the courier logos that worked, but now when they delivered food, they left it on the doorstep without knocking, and it was ice cold because she didn't know it was there.\n\nThe author is upset that the food was left without being called, leading to it being cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks the delivery person should have used common sense.\n\nHmm. So the author's intention was to prevent knocks, so she created effective signs. But the result was that the delivery person didn't knock and left the food outside. The problem here is that while the sign prevented knocks, the delivery person didn't communicate in another way, like calling or texting to let the author know the delivery was there. The author expected that the delivery person would follow the instruction not to knock but still inform them somehow. However, the delivery person didn't do that, leading to the food being left and getting cold.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, she put up clear instructions, which worked for the packages. But maybe she didn't consider that food deliveries might require different handling. For example, food is time-sensitive, so leaving it at the door without notification could be a problem. The author might have assumed that the delivery person would use common sense to call or text instead of just leaving it when the sign says not to knock. But the sign says \"Do not knock\" and doesn't specify that they should contact the customer in another way.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions literally. The sign didn't say \"Call when delivering\" or \"Text when here,\" so they might have interpreted \"Do not knock\" as \"Leave it at the door without any contact.\" The author might have expected the delivery person to adapt the method to the type of delivery (package vs. food), but maybe that's beyond the sign's instructions. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author's instructions were too vague or if the delivery person didn't use common sense. The author's husband says they asked for it, implying that they set up the situation that led to the problem. However, the author's main issue is that the delivery person didn't notify them in another way, leading to the cold food.\n\nIn many delivery scenarios, especially with food, it's common for delivery persons to call or text when arriving, even if there's a no-knock instruction. So maybe the delivery person should have used another communication method. But the sign didn't specify that. So the author might have been relying on the delivery person using common sense beyond the written instruction.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the sign was effective for packages but maybe not for food. However, she did create a situation where the delivery person followed the instructions literally, leading to the problem. The delivery person might have been remiss not to call, but the author's instructions didn't account for that. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and she did create the sign that led to the delivery person not knocking, even though she expected common sense, maybe she's partially responsible. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense regardless of the sign. If the sign only says \"Do not knock,\" but the delivery is time-sensitive, the delivery person should still notify the customer another way. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the delivery person didn't adapt. So answer B for No.\n"
