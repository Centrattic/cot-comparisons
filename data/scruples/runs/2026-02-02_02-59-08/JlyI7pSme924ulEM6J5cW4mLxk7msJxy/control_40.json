I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent people from knocking on the door when delivering packages. She had various attempts to communicate this, but people kept knocking. Then she used a sign with corporate logos which worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's intention was to avoid noise, maybe because she's a new mom needing rest or not wanting to disturb. She tried several methods to communicate her preference not to be knocked on. The problem came when the dinner delivery person followed the same protocol, which led to the food being left out and getting cold.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the context of different delivery types. Packages are usually left at the door, so not knocking makes sense. However, food delivery typically requires timely handoff to maintain temperature and freshness. The sign might have been interpreted as a general rule for all deliveries, but food delivery is different. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but maybe they should have used judgment to adapt.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She tried to communicate her preference, but maybe the sign was too broad. If the sign didn't specify \"except for food deliveries,\" then it's ambiguous. The delivery person might not have known to treat food differently. However, food delivery services usually require the recipient to be present to ensure the meal is hot and to handle any payment or instructions. So if the delivery person left it without checking, maybe they were at fault. But the author's sign could have been unclear. She might have expected the delivery person to use common sense, but if the sign didn't specify exceptions, she might share some responsibility for the misunderstanding.\n\nThe husband's comment suggests he thinks they were asking for it, but the author believes common sense should prevail. The question is whether the author's sign was clear enough. If the sign only said \"Do not Knock\" without exceptions, then the delivery person might not know to knock for food. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not clarifying that packages should be left at the door but food deliveries need to be knocked on. Alternatively, delivery people are expected to follow instructions given by the customer, even if it's a general rule. But in this case, the consequence was a cold meal, which is a valid concern.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't specify exceptions in her sign. The sign was a general instruction, and food delivery requires different handling. The delivery person followed the instruction as given, even though the outcome wasn't desired. The author could have adjusted the sign to include exceptions for food. However, if the sign had the company logos, maybe it was intended for package deliveries only. But without clear instructions, the delivery person had to follow the written rule. So the author's failure to specify exceptions makes her partly responsible.\n"
