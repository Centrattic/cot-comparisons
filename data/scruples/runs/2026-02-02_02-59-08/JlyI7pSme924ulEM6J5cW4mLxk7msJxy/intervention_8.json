I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom who gets many packages. She had previously put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to make noise, maybe to avoid waking the baby or causing disturbance. She tried multiple times to specify this in delivery notes, but it didn't work. Then she found a sign with corporate logos that actually worked by preventing knocking. But when they ordered food last night, the delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door, but the food was ice cold and 45 minutes late. The author is upset about that and her husband says they were asking for it. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo the key points are: the sign was effective for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food delivery person left it at the door, which the author didn't expect maybe, leading to the food being cold. The question is whether she's wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock despite the sign.\n\nI need to consider the intent behind the sign. She wanted to stop knocking for packages, which she succeeded in doing. However, food delivery might have different expectations. Maybe food delivery people are supposed to knock to ensure the food is received hot and fresh. The sign might have been misunderstood or applied to all deliveries regardless of type. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the sign worked well for packages but not for food. She expected the delivery person to use common sense and knock despite the sign because food is different. But the delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to a problem. \n\nNow, is she at fault? She created a rule (no knocking) that was followed, but the consequence was unintended. However, she should have considered that food delivery might require a different approach. Maybe she should have made exceptions or communicated differently for food. The husband's comment suggests he thinks they were asking for it by using the sign without considering the food scenario. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions given, which were clear. The problem arises because the author's instructions were too broad. She might be in the wrong for not specifying that the no-knocking rule applies only to packages and not food. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the delivery person should have known that food delivery requires a different handling, even if there's a \"do not knock\" sign. But the sign didn't specify exceptions. So maybe the author is partially responsible for not clarifying the rule's scope. \n\nIn some cases, delivery services have different protocols for packages versus food. The sign might have been intended for packages, but the delivery person applied it to food. However, the author's sign didn't specify, so the delivery person might not have known the difference. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for not making the sign more specific. Her instructions were for deliveries in general, but she didn't account for the difference between packages and food. Therefore, the answer could be that she is in the wrong (A) because she didn't provide clear instructions that differentiate between package deliveries and food deliveries. The delivery person followed the given instructions, but the outcome was negative due to the lack of specificity. Hence, the author should bear some responsibility.\n"
