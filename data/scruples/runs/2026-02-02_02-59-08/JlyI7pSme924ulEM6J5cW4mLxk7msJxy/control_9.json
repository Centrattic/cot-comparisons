I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" to keep delivery people from disturbing her baby. She had multiple signs and notes, but they kept knocking until she used a specific sign with courier logos. Then, when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold. She's upset because the food was late and cold, and her husband says they asked for it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent was to prevent knocking, which worked with the specific sign. However, the food delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally by not knocking and leaving the food at the door instead of bringing it inside. The result was that the food was cold. The author is upset that the delivery person didn't use common sense to ensure the food stayed warm, maybe by keeping it in the car until the person could answer.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a valid reason to want no knocking, especially as a new mom. She communicated her request multiple times, but the delivery people ignored it until the sign. The sign worked, but in this case, it backfired because the delivery person followed the instruction too literally. The author's problem is that the food was left outside and got cold. She might argue that the delivery person should have used judgment instead of just following the sign's instruction without considering the food's condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person followed the explicit instruction not to knock, which is what the sign said. The sign might not have specified to keep the food warm or bring it inside. So, the delivery person might not be at fault for interpreting the instruction literally. However, in food delivery, it's standard practice to ensure that the food is delivered in good condition. If leaving it outside would make it cold, the delivery person should have called or tried another method to ensure the food stays warm. The sign might have been unclear, but the delivery person could have used common sense here.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because her intent was to prevent knocking, which is reasonable. The problem is that the sign didn't account for food deliveries, which require different handling. The husband's comment that they asked for it is probably because the sign led to the delivery person leaving the food outside. However, the author could have considered that food needs to be kept warm and maybe added a note for food deliveries. But she did include \"Do not knock\" in delivery options, which might not have been sufficient. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's sign might have been too broad, not considering the specific needs of food delivery. However, the delivery person should have used common sense to ensure the food wasn't left out. The author's intention was valid, but the sign's effectiveness was flawed. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe the sign could have been more specific. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
