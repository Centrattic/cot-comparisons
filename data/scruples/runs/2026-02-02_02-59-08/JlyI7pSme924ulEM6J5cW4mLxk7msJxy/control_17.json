I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a new mom, gets a lot of packages delivered. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" in different places, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she made a sign with the company logos, which worked for stopping them from knocking, but now when they delivered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and the food got cold. She's asking if she's the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. She's trying to prevent delivery people from knocking because maybe she's a new mom and doesn't want the baby to be disturbed, or she's busy. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through signs and delivery notes, but they were ignored. So she made a more effective sign with company logos that made them not knock. But when a food delivery happened, the person didn't knock, left the food at the door, which got cold. Her husband says they're asking for it, but she thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, she's trying to prevent unnecessary noise (maybe for her baby), so she took steps to communicate her preference. However, when food is delivered, it's different from a package. Food is perishable and needs to be handled quickly. If the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, maybe they assumed the recipient would come out quickly, but if the door was closed and the person didn't hear the knock (but the sign said not to knock), then the food could get cold. \n\nShe might have conflated different types of deliveries. Packages are static, but food requires immediate attention. So maybe her solution was too broad, applying the \"no knock\" rule to all deliveries, including food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't realize the urgency of the food delivery. So perhaps she didn't consider that different types of deliveries have different handling needs.\n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. If the food is time-sensitive, common sense would dictate that even if there's a no-knock policy, they should knock to ensure the recipient gets the food hot. But the author might argue that she can't expect delivery people to read her mind about which deliveries are urgent. The sign was clear, so the delivery person followed it, leading to the problem.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author used the sign effectively for packages, but maybe she should have specified that it's only for non-food deliveries. If she had a different sign for packages and another for food, that could have avoided the issue. However, she didn't mention that. Her husband's comment suggests that they might have overgeneralized the policy without considering exceptions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: the delivery person followed the instructions given, but the author's instructions might have been too broad. However, the food delivery is a different scenario. The author might not be in the wrong because she had a legitimate reason to minimize noise, but she didn't account for the different needs of food vs. packages. The delivery person could be at fault for not adapting to the situation, but the author's instructions led them to not knock. So it's a bit of a grey area.\n\nI think the key is whether the author's instructions were reasonable. Her intent was to reduce noise, which is understandable. However, she didn't consider that food requires immediate attention. The delivery person followed the rules but didn't apply common sense. The author might not be entirely wrong, but perhaps she should have made exceptions. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she made the sign to prevent knocking, and the delivery person acted on it, maybe she's partially responsible for not anticipating that. But given the context of being a new mom, maybe her approach is more understandable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the delivery person should have known better. But the sign was explicit. So it's a bit of a toss-up. The answer depends on whether the instructions were reasonable given the different types of deliveries. If the sign was a no-knock rule for all deliveries, that's where the problem is. If she had a way to differentiate, maybe not. But since she didn't, she might be at fault for not considering the different needs. But her husband's comment says they were asking for it, implying she's the one who caused the problem by making the sign too strict. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't account for different delivery types, but maybe it's a split. However, in AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and reasonableness. Since her intent was to reduce disturbance, but it led to a negative outcome, maybe she's not at fault. Hmm. Wait, but the problem is that she had a solution that worked for packages but not for food. Maybe she should have adjusted her approach. Since the sign was too broad, she's partially responsible. Therefore, answer A.\n"
