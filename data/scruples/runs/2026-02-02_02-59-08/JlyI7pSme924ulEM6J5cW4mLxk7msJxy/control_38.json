I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door, which she doesn't want. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through notes on the package and in the delivery options. But the delivery people kept knocking. So she put up a sign with corporate logos to deter them. It worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, resulting in cold food.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, her intent was to prevent people from knocking, which she did because maybe she's busy with her baby and doesn't want interruptions. She tried multiple times to communicate this, but the delivery people didn't heed her warnings. The sign worked for packages, so she assumed it would for food too. But food delivery might be different because the customer usually expects the delivery person to knock to hand it over, especially if it's something that needs to be warm or fresh. \n\nHer mistake might be that the sign was meant for package deliveries, not for food deliveries. Food delivery services might have different expectations. The delivery person might not have realized that the sign applied to food as well. The sign had logos of package couriers, not the food delivery company. So maybe the sign was misunderstood. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he thinks using the sign for food was their fault. The user's argument is that common sense should have prevailed\u2014if the delivery person saw the sign, they should have known not to knock. But the delivery person might have thought the sign was only for packages, not for food. \n\nSo, was the user wrong? She intended to prevent knocking, but maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. She didn't clarify that the sign applied to food deliveries as well. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't consider that the food needed to be handed over. In that case, maybe the user is in the wrong because she didn't make it clear that the sign applied to all deliveries, including food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food needs to be handed over. \n\nI think the key point is the sign's ambiguity. If the sign only had package courier logos, it might not apply to food delivery. The user didn't specify that it's for all deliveries. So the delivery person followed the sign but didn't realize the exception for food. Therefore, the user's sign might have been misleading, making her at least partially at fault. But maybe not entirely, since she was trying to communicate her preference. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used better judgment. If they saw the sign, they should have assumed it was for all deliveries. But maybe the sign wasn't meant for food. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, the user's main issue was with packages, so using a sign meant for packages and not food might have been the mistake. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because the sign was intended for package deliveries, not food, and she didn't clarify that. But if the sign was meant for all deliveries, then the delivery person's action was wrong. \n\nHmm. The sign's content (logos of package couriers) probably made it clear that it was for packages. So when the food delivery person saw the sign, they assumed it applied to their delivery too. But food delivery is different. The user should have specified that the sign doesn't apply to food. Therefore, she's in the wrong because the sign was ambiguous. So answer A.\n"
