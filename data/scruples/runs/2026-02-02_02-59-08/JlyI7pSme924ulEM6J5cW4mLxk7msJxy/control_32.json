I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been getting a lot of packages delivered. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock on her door, maybe to avoid disturbing her baby or just to keep it quiet. She tried different methods, like writing in the checkout notes and putting up signs with courier logos. It worked for packages, but then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nSo the question is, is she wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock? Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a new mom, so maybe she needs quiet, and the signs were put up for a good reason. But when it comes to food delivery versus packages, there's a difference. Packages can be left at the door, but food deliveries usually require someone to be present to take them, especially if it's hot food. The delivery person might assume that food should be signed for or handed over, so knocking makes sense here. \n\nShe did put up signs with specific courier logos, which worked for packages. But when it comes to food, maybe the delivery person didn't use common sense and just followed the sign literally. The sign might have been intended for packages, not food, but the delivery person might not make that distinction. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she had a valid reason for the signs, but maybe she should have specified that the signs are only for packages, not food deliveries. However, she might not have thought of that. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used common sense and realized that leaving hot food at the door without knocking could result in it getting cold. So maybe the delivery person is at fault for not using judgment. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The husband says they were asking for it, implying that by putting up the signs, they invited the delivery person to not knock for food. But the author argues that common sense should have been applied. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person has a duty to ensure the food is delivered properly. If the sign said not to knock, but the food order didn't include that note, maybe the delivery person was overreaching by following the general sign. However, the author might be responsible for not making it clear that the signs apply only to packages. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a gray area. But since she's a new mom and the signs were put up for a good reason, and the delivery person should have used common sense, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, No. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author could have made the signs more specific. But given the situation as presented, the answer is likely B.\n"
