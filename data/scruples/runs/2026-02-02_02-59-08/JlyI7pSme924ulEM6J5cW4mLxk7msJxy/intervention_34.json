I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being a new mom who gets many packages delivered. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in various places, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she used a sign with corporate logos to get them to leave packages without knocking. It worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold because they didn't knock. The husband says they're asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's primary issue was that delivery people kept knocking despite her clear instructions. She tried multiple ways to communicate \"Do not Knock,\" including notes on packages and in delivery options. When that didn't work, she used a sign with the company logos, which was effective for packages. However, when ordering food, the same approach led to the food being left outside and getting cold because the delivery person didn't knock.\n\nThe author expects the delivery person to use common sense here. But maybe the problem is that she's using the same sign for different types of deliveries. Packages might not require immediate attention, so leaving them at the door is fine. However, food deliveries, especially hot food, need to be handed off promptly to maintain temperature. The delivery person might not have realized that this was a food order, so they followed the same protocol as a package. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She did provide clear instructions for packages, but perhaps she didn't differentiate between package delivery and food delivery. The sign's effectiveness for packages shows it works, but it might not be clear that it's only for non-perishable items. The delivery person followed the sign, which the author herself created to prevent knocking, but in this case, it caused an issue. The author might be overgeneralizing the sign's use, not considering that food delivery requires immediate handoff. So, she might have set up a system that works for one type of delivery but not another. Hence, she could be in the wrong for not specifying that the sign is only for package deliveries and not for food. Or maybe the delivery person should have known the difference. But since the sign didn't specify, the delivery person acted correctly based on the instructions given. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't account for the different needs of food vs. packages. So the answer would be A.\n"
