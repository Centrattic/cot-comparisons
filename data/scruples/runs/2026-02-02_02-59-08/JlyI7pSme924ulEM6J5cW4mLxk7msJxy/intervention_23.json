I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who put up signs saying not to knock for package deliveries because she didn't want the delivery people to wake the baby. She had these signs in various places, but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with corporate logos, which worked. But when she ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent delivery people from knocking to avoid disturbing the baby. That makes sense. She tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock\" through signs and delivery notes. When those didn't work, she used a sign with corporate logos. That worked for packages, but then the food delivery person followed it too literally, leading to the food being left outside and getting cold.\n\nNow, the key points here: the sign was for packages, but the food delivery person might not have recognized the difference. The sign's instructions were clear but perhaps too broad. The author might have expected delivery people to use common sense, like knocking for food deliveries even if there's a \"do not knock\" sign. However, the sign didn't specify different types of deliveries, so the person might have followed the instruction without realizing it was for food.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did mention \"delivery options\" notes for each order, which the package deliverers ignored. The food delivery person might not check those notes if they're not part of the same service. The sign with logos might be for specific courier companies, but the food delivery service might not be one of them, leading to confusion.\n\nThe author and husband ordered dinner, expecting it to be delivered warm. The delivery person's adherence to the sign, though correct for packages, was not appropriate for food. The author might be at fault for not clarifying that the sign applies only to packages, not food deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment to knock since the food is time-sensitive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the sign, which worked for packages, but didn't consider that food might require a different approach. The sign's lack of specificity is an issue here. The husband's comment \"we were asking for it\" suggests that maybe the sign's presence led to unintended consequences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her needs, but perhaps not clearly enough. The sign's instructions were too broad, leading to a situation where food was left out. She might have expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the sign didn't account for different delivery types. Therefore, the author's approach had a flaw, making her at least partially at fault.\n"
