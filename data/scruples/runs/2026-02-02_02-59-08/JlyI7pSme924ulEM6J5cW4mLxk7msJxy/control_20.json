I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying not to knock, but when a food delivery person followed the sign and left the food at the door, it got cold. The author is upset, and her husband says they asked for it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had multiple signs and notes to not knock. The delivery person saw the sign and didn't knock, left the food at the door. The food was cold, so they got upset. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to avoid the delivery person knocking, which they had issues with before. They thought the sign worked. But now, the delivery person followed the instruction literally, which caused a problem. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have not left the food outside, especially if it's cold.\n\nOn one hand, she explicitly told not to knock, which the delivery person followed. On the other, maybe the delivery person should have used some discretion, like calling or leaving it in a secure place. But the sign didn't mention anything about handling the food. The sign was specifically about not knocking. So maybe the delivery person did what was instructed, but the unintended consequence was the problem. \n\nThe author's husband says they asked for it, implying they should have considered that the sign might lead to the food being left outside. The author's argument is that common sense should have been used, but the delivery person might not be responsible for interpreting beyond the given instruction. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not anticipating that their instructions would lead to the food being left at the door. Or if the delivery person should have used better judgment despite the instructions. In terms of responsibility, the author set the instruction, so maybe they're responsible for the outcome. But maybe the delivery person should have checked if the recipient was present or not before leaving it outside. However, the sign didn't mention that. \n\nI think the key here is that the sign was specific to not knock, not about handling the delivery. So the delivery person followed the instruction as given. The author's problem is that the delivery person didn't use common sense beyond the instruction. But the delivery person isn't necessarily at fault for following the written instruction. However, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that their instructions could lead to an unsatisfactory result. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have used their own judgment. \n\nBut in many delivery contexts, there are protocols. If the recipient says not to knock, the delivery person might have to leave it at the door unless there's a specific instruction otherwise. So the author's instructions were followed, but the outcome was bad. In that case, the author might be at fault for not considering the implications of their instructions. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have called or checked if someone was there. But if they can't ring the doorbell or knock, maybe they just leave it. So the author's problem is that their instructions were too strict. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to prevent a previous issue (knocking), but the delivery person followed the instructions, leading to an unintended problem. However, maybe the author should have included more specific instructions. Wait, the sign had the corporate logos, so maybe it's a sign that's supposed to be part of the delivery instructions. If the delivery person was supposed to use the sign's guidelines, which don't include anything about food temperature, then the author's instructions were followed correctly. \n\nSo the author's mistake was not considering that the delivery person would follow the instruction literally, leading to a cold meal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to account for the delivery person's literal adherence to their instructions, even though they meant to avoid knocking. But the delivery person also might have a responsibility to ensure the food is delivered properly if the recipient isn't present. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's instructions were followed, but they didn't consider the consequences. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not providing more detailed instructions. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense beyond the given instructions. \n\nIn many delivery situations, if the recipient says not to knock, the default is to leave it at the door. So the delivery person did what was instructed, and the author's problem is with the outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider that their instructions might lead to an unsatisfactory result. But the delivery person isn't at fault for following the instructions as given. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't anticipate that the delivery person would follow the instructions to the letter, leading to the problem. Alternatively, if the delivery person should have used discretion, then B. \n\nBut based on standard delivery protocols, if you tell them not to knock, they leave it at the door. The author's problem is that they didn't have a safe place for the delivery, or they should have provided more specific instructions. So the author is in the wrong because they set up instructions that led to the problem, not considering the delivery person's actions.\n"
