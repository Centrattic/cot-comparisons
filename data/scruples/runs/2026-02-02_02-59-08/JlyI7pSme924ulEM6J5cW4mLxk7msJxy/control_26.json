I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying not to knock, which was there for packages. But when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, it was cold, and they were upset. The husband said they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, the author had specific instructions not to knock, which were ignored for packages. Then, when they used a more prominent sign with logos, it worked too well for the food delivery person to leave the food outside. The problem here is that the food was left unattended and got cold. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's sign was effective but maybe too broad. The sign might have been interpreted by the delivery person as a general instruction for all deliveries, including food. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which led to the food being left outside. \n\nBut wait, the author might not have considered that food deliveries require a different handling. Maybe the sign should have exceptions for food. The author had written \"Do not knock\" in multiple places, but maybe the delivery person didn't check the specific instructions each time. However, the sign with logos was more visible, so the delivery person might have just followed it without reading the details.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The author set up the sign to prevent knocking, which worked for packages but not for food. The husband's point is that they were asking for this by not allowing knocks, which might prevent the delivery person from confirming the correct delivery. The author's intent was to avoid disturbances, but food delivery might need a different approach. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to prevent knocks for packages, which they had a right to do. However, maybe they should have made an exception for food. But since the sign was in place, the delivery person followed it, leading to an unintended consequence. The author's responsibility is to ensure their instructions are clear enough for different types of deliveries. Maybe they need to adjust the sign to specify that food should be handled differently. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason to avoid knocks, and the delivery person followed the instructions provided. The fault could be on the delivery person for not using common sense with food, but the author also might need to clarify their instructions next time.\n"
