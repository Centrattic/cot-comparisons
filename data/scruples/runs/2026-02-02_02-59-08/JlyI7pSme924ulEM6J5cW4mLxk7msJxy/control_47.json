I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages. They had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in different versions, but the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So they put up a sign with the corporate logos that said not to knock, and it worked for packages. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food outside, which got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent loud knocks for packages since they're new parents. That makes sense. They tried multiple times to communicate \"no knock\" through notes and signs. When the food delivery happened, the delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door. But the problem is that the food was left out and got cold. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to use common sense here.\n\nThe key points are: the author set up the sign for packages, but food delivery is different. The sign was specific to packages, but maybe the delivery person assumed it applied to all deliveries. Alternatively, maybe the sign was too generic, and the delivery person didn't differentiate between a package and a food order. The author expects the delivery person to understand that food needs to be handed over, not left outside. The husband's point is that they set up the rules, so they can't complain when it's followed. The author's defense is that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should know that food isn't a package and needs to be given in person.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they created a system that worked for packages but didn't account for food. The sign might have been too broad. They should have considered differentiating between packages and food deliveries in their instructions. However, the delivery person might not have realized the sign was only for packages. The author's mistake might be not making the sign specific enough. On the other hand, the delivery person could have used their own judgment. But the author's signs were explicit, so maybe they are responsible for the unintended consequence. However, since the sign worked as intended for packages, the author might not be in the wrong because the delivery person just followed the instructions. The food delivery situation is a different scenario, so the author might not be at fault. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the sign was for packages, and the food delivery person should have known to handle it differently. Alternatively, since the sign was there and the person followed it, maybe the author is partially at fault. But given the context, the author's intention was valid, and the delivery person's mistake was in not using common sense for food. So the answer is B.\n"
