I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions to not do so. She put up signs and notes, but they were ignored. So, she created a sign with the courier logos, which worked in preventing knocks. But then, when ordering dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door, causing it to get cold. She's now questioning if she's the asshole here.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The sign worked for packages but not ideal for food. She expected the delivery person to use common sense and not leave perishable items outside. But she had the sign up, which might have confused the delivery person into thinking they should avoid knocking at all costs, even for hot food. \n\nThe author's intention was to stop knocking, which they achieved, but maybe the method was too broad. The sign might not have been specific enough. Perhaps she should have differentiated between packages and food deliveries. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that the sign's message was too rigid, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, not considering that food requires different handling. The author might argue that common sense should have been used, but maybe the sign didn't convey that nuance. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She made a mistake in not anticipating that the sign might be followed too strictly, leading to a worse outcome for food deliveries. She should have considered the difference between packages and perishable items. Therefore, maybe she's partially at fault. But the delivery person also didn't use judgment. However, since the question is about her being in the wrong, the answer might be A because she didn't account for the different treatment needed for food.\n"
