I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but when they finally worked, a food delivery left it at the door, leading to cold food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author had a problem with package deliveries being knocked on the door, which they found disruptive. So they put up signs and notes to prevent that. When the signs worked for a package, it applied to a food delivery that was supposed to be delivered hot. The deliverer didn't knock and left it outside, causing the food to be cold. The author is upset because the food was left unattended, but the deliverer followed the explicit instructions.\n\nThe key points here are the instructions given. The author had repeatedly specified \"Do not knock\" through various channels. The deliverer followed those instructions literally, even when it wasn't optimal for a food delivery. The problem arises because the instructions were meant for packages, not food. The author might not have considered that food deliveries require a different handling\u2014like ensuring the food is handed over warm. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they set clear instructions, but maybe they didn't clarify that food is a different case. The deliverer followed the written rules but didn't use common sense. However, the author might not have communicated that exceptions exist for food. The husband thinks they asked for it by having the sign up. But the author expects common sense from the deliverer despite the instructions. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The deliverer followed the given instructions, which were to not knock and leave the item at the door. However, food deliveries usually require handing over the item to prevent it from getting cold. The author might not have realized that their instructions were too broad. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not specifying exceptions, but the deliverer also didn't use judgment. \n\nIn terms of AITA, typically if someone follows instructions explicitly given but the outcome is negative, the responsibility might lie with the person who gave the instructions if they were ambiguous. However, since the instructions were clear and the deliverer didn't adapt, maybe the deliverer is at fault. But the author might not be in the wrong because they had a valid reason for the signs. The answer might depend on whether the food delivery was supposed to be handed off versus left at the door. Since food is perishable, the deliverer should have used discretion, even with the signs. So the author isn't necessarily the asshole here.\n"
