I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying not to knock because she didn't want the delivery people making noise when she was home with her baby. She tried different methods, like handwritten signs and notes in the delivery options, but people kept knocking. Then she switched to a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but when they ordered dinner, the food was left at the door and got cold.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a valid reason for, being a new mom needing quiet. She tried various ways to communicate this, but the problem is that when the food came, the delivery person just left it at the door without knocking, leading to a problem. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, she clearly communicated her preference not to be knocked, which she has a right to. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but maybe didn't exercise judgment in a situation where knocking might actually be necessary (like for food delivery where temperature matters). The sign's effectiveness for packages doesn't account for perishable items that need immediate attention. So, maybe the author didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. However, the delivery person might be following the sign literally without using discretion. \n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to set her rules, but maybe didn't account for exceptions. On the other, the delivery person could have used common sense here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she didn't specify exceptions, but the delivery person didn't adapt, maybe neither is entirely wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since she communicated her preferences and the delivery person didn't adjust for the specific situation, it's more on the delivery person's side. However, the sign might have been too broad. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she had a valid reason and communicated it, but the delivery person should have used judgment. The husband's comment might be hasty.\n"
