I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She had signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want the noise, probably to keep the baby calm. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes on the packages and in delivery options. When the delivery people ignored her, she put up a sign with the courier logos, which worked in that they didn't knock, but now they just leave the food at the door, leading to it getting cold.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. The sign was meant to stop them from knocking, but she didn't clarify that they should bring the food into the house or wait for a response. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, so they left it at the door. The author expected them to use common sense and maybe bring it in, but the sign didn't say that. The husband's comment adds that maybe they were asking for it by not being clear.\n\nSo, the key points are about clear communication. The author wanted no knocking, which the sign achieved, but she didn't specify how the delivery should be handled otherwise. The delivery person did what was instructed but didn't read between the lines. The author might have assumed the delivery would be handled with discretion, but the sign was explicit. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for not specifying further. But then again, expecting common sense might be reasonable. However, since the sign was very specific about not knocking, the delivery person might not have known to bring it inside. So, perhaps the author is at fault for not being clear on the alternative action.\n"
