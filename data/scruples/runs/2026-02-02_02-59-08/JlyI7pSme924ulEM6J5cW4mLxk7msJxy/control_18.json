I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages. She got fed up because delivery people kept knocking despite the signs. Then she put up a sign with the courier logos and it worked too well. The food delivery person left the dinner at the door without knocking, causing it to get cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the mom thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the intent behind the sign and the consequences. The mom's initial issue was that delivery people ignored her instructions to not knock. She then created a more effective sign, which led to the opposite problem. The question is whether she's at fault for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign but not considering that food delivery might require a different approach.\n\nFirst, the sign was meant for packages, not food. The mom might not have realized that food delivery could have different protocols. She put the sign up to prevent knocking for packages, but when a food delivery came, the person followed the sign literally. The problem is that food delivery usually requires leaving it at the door, but in cold weather or situations, maybe knocking isn't necessary. However, in this case, the food got cold because it was left outside. \n\nThe mom's intention was to avoid the noise and hassle of deliveries when she's a new parent. Her actions were to address a prior issue with package deliveries. The food delivery person might have followed the sign without considering that it's a food order, which is a different scenario. The question is whether she's wrong for expecting the sign to be followed in all cases, including food delivery.\n\nOn one hand, she made the sign for packages, so maybe she didn't consider food deliveries. On the other hand, she wanted to avoid knocks entirely, even if it meant food would be left outside. The fact that the food was left at the door and got cold might be a consequence she didn't anticipate. The husband's comment suggests that they set the rules, but maybe the sign was too broad.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the sign's instructions were reasonable. If the sign was specific to packages, then the food delivery person might have overcomplicated it. But since the mom included the courier logos, maybe she intended it for all deliveries. The delivery person did follow the sign, which was the opposite of what she wanted for food. So, she might be at fault for not differentiating between package and food deliveries in her sign. However, she was trying to solve a problem, and the unintended consequence was the food being left outside. \n\nI think the key here is that the sign was intended to prevent knocks for packages, but she didn't account for food deliveries. So, she's partially responsible for not considering that different types of deliveries might need different handling. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
