I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying not to knock, which were ignored. Then she used a sign with courier logos, and it worked too well. The food was left outside and got cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to prevent people from knocking, probably because she's a new mom and doesn't want to be disturbed. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and the sign. The result was that the delivery person left the food outside, which was cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author wasn't wrong in trying to communicate her preference, but maybe the sign was too effective. The delivery person followed the sign literally, not realizing that food shouldn't be left outside. However, the sign was meant for packages, not food. The author might have assumed that the delivery person would use judgment, but signs can't cover every scenario. Maybe she should have considered that food deliveries need a different handling. But the main issue is that she set up the sign to avoid being disturbed, and the delivery person followed it. The problem here is a communication gap. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense despite the sign, which might be the issue. So, is she in the wrong? Possibly, because the sign's instructions were followed literally, leading to a negative outcome. But maybe she's not entirely at fault since the sign was meant for packages, not food. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is that the author's instructions were clear, but the delivery person didn't adapt. However, the author might have overlooked the different needs for food vs. packages. So maybe she's not entirely wrong, but she could have done something differently. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she set up the sign to avoid being disturbed, which is reasonable, and the delivery person followed it. But the husband's point is that they were \"asking for it,\" implying they knew the risk. But the main question is about expecting the delivery person to knock. The sign said not to, but the delivery person didn't knock for food, which is a different case. So the author's expectation here is conflicting. She wanted no knocking for packages but needed to handle food differently. The sign was for packages, so maybe she didn't consider that food requires a different approach. But the sign wasn't specific. So she might not be in the wrong because the sign wasn't meant for food. Therefore, answer B.\n"
