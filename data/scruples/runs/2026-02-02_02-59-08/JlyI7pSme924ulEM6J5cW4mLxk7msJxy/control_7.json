I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby. She used various signs and notes, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she found a sign with the courier logos, which stopped the knocking but led to a problem when a food delivery was left at the door and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points here. The author's intent was to prevent knocking for packages, which she tried multiple times to communicate. The sign with the courier logos worked, but when applied to a food delivery, it resulted in the meal being left outside and getting cold. The key question is whether she's at fault here.\n\nThe author didn't specify different rules for different types of deliveries. The sign said \"Do not Knock\" in general, which the food delivery person followed literally. The problem is that food deliveries typically require knocking to ensure someone is there to receive it. By not knocking, the delivery person left it at the door, leading to a cold meal. \n\nBut the author's intention was to avoid noise for the baby, which is understandable. However, the sign didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food deliveries. The delivery person might have assumed that the sign applied to all deliveries, not just packages. The author's husband says they asked for it, which suggests they should have been more specific. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her needs, but maybe not clearly enough for all situations. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which were to not knock, leading to an unintended consequence. The author might have expected common sense to prevail, but in this case, the delivery person adhered strictly to the sign without considering the context of food delivery. \n\nHowever, the author's main goal was to prevent knocking for packages. Food delivery might be a different scenario where knocking is necessary. The problem is that the sign didn't make that distinction. So, while her intention was valid, the way she communicated it may have been too broad, leading to this issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have used better judgment. But the author's sign was clear, so maybe the fault isn't entirely hers. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because she tried to communicate her needs, but the situation had an oversight. But the husband's point is that they asked for it by being too strict. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't specify exceptions for food. The sign was a general \"Do not Knock,\" which applied to all deliveries. The delivery person followed it, leading to the problem. The author might be in the wrong because she didn't account for different types of deliveries. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense. But the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nIn the end, the sign's effectiveness for packages worked, but it backfired on a food delivery. The author's oversight was not specifying exceptions. Therefore, she might share some responsibility, but the delivery person also might have handled it better. However, the question is about the author's responsibility. Since she didn't make the sign specific to packages only, the answer might be that she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's a shared responsibility. But according to the options given (A for yes, B for no), the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because her intent was reasonable, but maybe A if the sign's lack of specificity is considered a mistake. However, the community's typical response to such AITA scenarios often looks for who's more at fault. If the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it, the author might not be the asshole. So, B.\n"
