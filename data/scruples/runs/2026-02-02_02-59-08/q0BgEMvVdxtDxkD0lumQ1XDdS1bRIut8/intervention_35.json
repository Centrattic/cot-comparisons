I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The details given are that the author is 23, doesn't like kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and has a house that's not babyproofed. The brother asked two days before a cruise, which they'd planned for five years, and the author said no. The siblings argued, and the brother called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations within family. Sometimes family expects help, especially in emergencies. But here, the brother's sister couldn't take the kids due to a medical emergency. However, they waited until two days before to ask the author, which might be a problem. The author has valid reasons: they work from home, have a side job with appointments, can't move their setup, and their house isn't safe. Also, the author uses marijuana regularly, which the brother doesn't want around kids.\n\nThe brother's request seems last-minute and places a significant burden on the author. The author isn't getting paid and would have to use PTO. The brother's sister was supposed to take the kids but had to leave, so maybe the brother should have looked for alternatives earlier. The author's refusal is based on realistic constraints and personal boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's reaction\u2014yelling, calling names, and ranting online\u2014seems excessive. The author isn't obligated to help, especially with the short notice and lack of compensation. The fact that the author made their dislike of kids clear before being asked might mean the brother should have known this wasn't feasible. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the brother's poor planning, the author's valid reasons, and the brother's harsh response, the author isn't in the wrong. The brother's actions and demands are unreasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
