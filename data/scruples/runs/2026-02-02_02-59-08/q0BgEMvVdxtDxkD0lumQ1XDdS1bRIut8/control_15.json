I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is 23, a member of a child-free community, hates kids, doesn't have a baby-proof house, and uses marijuana. Their brother asked two days before a cruise for them to watch the kids, but the author said no. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook. The author's sister is pressuring them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's personal boundaries and the timing of the request. The brother asked last minute, and the author has valid reasons: work commitments, lack of space, and personal dislike for kids. The author isn't being paid, which is a big factor. Also, the brother's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling for an hour and public shaming. \n\nThe author isn't obligated to help family in this situation. They have their own life and responsibilities. The brother planned the trip for five years, but waiting until two days before to ask for help is unreasonable. The author's refusal isn't selfish if they can't realistically take on the responsibility. Plus, the brother's kids aren't their responsibility in the first place. \n\nThe fact that the author uses marijuana might be a red herring here, but the brother's demand to remove it is an added stress. The author's house isn't safe, which is a valid concern. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their refusal is based on legitimate constraints and personal boundaries. The brother's reaction is more about their own frustration than the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer should be B.\n"
