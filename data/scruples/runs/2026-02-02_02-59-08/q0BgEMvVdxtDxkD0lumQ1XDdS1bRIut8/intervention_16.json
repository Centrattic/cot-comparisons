I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. They mentioned that the author is part of r/childfree and really doesn't like kids, which is known by the family. The brother asked last minute, two days before a cruise, and the author had work commitments and a house that's not babyproofed. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. First, the author has made their stance on kids clear\u2014they hate them and it's a well-known fact. The brother and sister-in-law asked for help last minute, which is probably a big ask for anyone. The author has valid reasons: work commitments, needing PTO, not having a safe environment, and personal dislike of kids. But the family is upset because they needed someone to watch the kids at the last minute. \n\nIs the author wrong for saying no? Well, family obligations can be tricky. On one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they've communicated their discomfort with kids. They have legitimate reasons related to work and personal safety. On the other hand, the brother's trip was planned for five years, and maybe they didn't plan ahead. But the author isn't obligated to help unless there's an existing agreement. The brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming seems excessive. \n\nThe author's sister thinks they should watch the kids, but the author's situation isn't feasible. The key points are the last-minute request, the author's prior communication of their stance, and the impracticality of the request. The brother's side not considering the author's constraints and reacting poorly might shift the blame more towards them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their inability to help, had valid reasons, and the family's anger seems unwarranted, especially with the public shaming. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
