I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. They have a job that allows some flexibility, but they work from home. They also have a side business with car repairs. The brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, but the author declined. The brother and his wife were upset and called the author names. The author argues that their house isn't safe, they have work commitments, and they don't like kids.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are: timing of the request (last minute), the author's inability to accommodate due to work and house safety, the fact that the parents weren't offering to pay, and the author's personal dislike for children. \n\nIn many cases, family can expect support, but this request was made very suddenly. The author did mention they were saving PTO for a planned trip, which adds to their justification. Also, the parents' reaction seems harsh\u2014calling someone a drug addict and ranting on Facebook isn't great. The author isn't in a position to provide a safe environment, which is a valid concern for the kids' well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided honest reasons and couldn't realistically take on the responsibility. The brother's approach was probably too aggressive, especially given the short notice. The answer should be B.\n"
