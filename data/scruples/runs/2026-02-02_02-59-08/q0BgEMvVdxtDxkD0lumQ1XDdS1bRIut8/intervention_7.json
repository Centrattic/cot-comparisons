I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is that the author, who is 23 and part of a child-free community, strongly dislikes children and uses marijuana regularly. Their brother asked last-minute for them to take care of the kids for a week, which would require using PTO, adjusting their work setup, and making their home safe for kids. The author said no, and the brother and sister-in-law got angry, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. The author mentions hating children, which the family is aware of. They also have a home not suitable for kids, a workload that can't be adjusted, and the fact that they weren't paid. The brother had the trip planned for five years, but the request came two days before departure, which is very short notice. The author's job is okay with marijuana use, but the brother wants no drugs in the house during the kids' stay.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have valid reasons: personal dislike of kids, logistical issues, and the last-minute request. However, the brother's side might see family obligation as important. The author might be seen as not stepping up when family is in need, especially since the sister couldn't help. But the author did say no and explain their reasons, which are practical and personal.\n\nThe key points here are the last-minute request, the author's known dislike of kids, and the infeasibility of the request. The author isn't in a position to provide childcare, and the brother's expectations might be unreasonable given the circumstances. The author isn't being selfish without cause; they have legitimate constraints. The brother's reaction seems harsh, accusing the author of being a \"drug addict\" and using social media to rant, which is unkind. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a choice based on their circumstances and communicated their reasons. The brother's expectations might be unreasonable, especially with the short notice and not considering the author's lifestyle. The author isn't obligated to put their own life on hold for the brother's anniversary cruise. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
