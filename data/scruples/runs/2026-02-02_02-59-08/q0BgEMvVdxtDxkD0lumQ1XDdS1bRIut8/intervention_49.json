I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let's look at the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, a member of a child-free group, and openly states they hate children. Their family is aware of this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it regularly. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have work commitments that can't be moved. They also mention they were saving PTO for a trip.\n\nThe brother asked last-minute (two days before the cruise) to watch the kids. The parents had planned the cruise for five years and had to change babysitters because their sister couldn't do it. The author refused, leading to an argument and the parents labeling them a drug addict and an asshole. The author argues that the request is unreasonable given their work, personal preferences, and the state of their home.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The parents did ask last-minute, which is a problem. They wanted a safe environment free of drugs, which the author can't provide. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons\u2014work obligations, personal comfort, and safety. They aren't being paid, and it's a significant time commitment. The parents' reaction seems harsh, calling them names and using social media to rant. The author's stance seems justified because they can't meet the parents' requirements, and they have legitimate reasons for saying no. While family expectations might be high, the author isn't obligated to accommodate such a last-minute request, especially with their own priorities and the impossibility of making their home safe in two days. The parents should have had a backup plan. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
