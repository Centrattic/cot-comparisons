I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given AskReddit-style post is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 23 years old, single, lives in a state where marijuana is legal. They're part of the childfree community and don't like kids. They work from home, have a side job fixing cars, and use marijuana frequently. Their house isn't baby-proofed.\n\nThe brother wanted to take his wife on a cruise for their anniversary but couldn't leave the kids with their sister because her husband's family had a medical emergency. They asked the author two days before the trip. The author says no because they can't take time off work (using PTO), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't stop using marijuana. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook. The author's sister is pressuring them too.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's reasons for refusal (work commitment, house safety, personal preferences), the timing of the request (last-minute), and the family's reaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? From a typical perspective, family obligations can sometimes require flexibility, but there are limits. The author has valid reasons: they have a job that's not flexible, a house that's not safe, and a known dislike of kids. The brother knew the author didn't like kids but asked last-minute. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but practical issues. The family's reaction might be excessive. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to help family when needed, but if the request is unreasonable or last-minute, it's understandable to say no. The author isn't being selfish for prioritizing their own responsibilities. The brother should have planned ahead or found another solution. The author's stance seems justified. So the answer is B (no, not in the wrong).\n"
