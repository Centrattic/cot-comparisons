I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author is 23, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and is part of a child-free community. They hate children, their house isn't baby-proofed, and they smoke marijuana frequently. Their job allows some flexibility, but they work from home and have a side business with repair appointments. They also have a planned guys' trip in two months and were saving PTO for that.\n\nThe brother wanted to go on a cruise for their five-year-planned anniversary trip. Originally, they planned to leave the kids with their sister, but the sister had to leave due to a family emergency. Two days before the trip, the brother asked the author to babysit. The author said no, explaining they can't take time off, don't have a safe environment, and can't quit using marijuana. The brother and sister-in-law reacted angrily, called the author derogatory names, and the sister is now pressuring them. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have a valid dislike for children, which is a personal preference. Their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't adjust that quickly. Also, they have work commitments and a planned trip that they can't just drop. The brother asked last minute, which is a problem. The request is to watch the kids for a week without payment, which would cost the author their PTO and income from their side job. The brother's reaction was harsh, but the author's refusal seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, family obligations can be a factor. The brother's trip was planned years in advance, and maybe they expected family to help. However, the author was only asked two days before, which is very short notice. The author's reasons for refusal are practical and personal, and they're not obligated to put their life on hold for others unless it's a close family emergency. The brother's demands to get rid of their marijuana and baby-proof the house in two days are unrealistic.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. Their refusal is based on legitimate reasons: personal dislike, unsafe living conditions, work commitments, and not being paid. The brother's reaction is over the top, but the author's stance is justified. So the answer should be B.\n"
