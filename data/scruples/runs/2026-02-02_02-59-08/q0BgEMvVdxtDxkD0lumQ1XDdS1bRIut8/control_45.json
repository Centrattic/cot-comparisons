I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The answer options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author is 23, part of a family where he's the youngest. He's in r/childfree and hates kids, which the family knows. He uses marijuana, and his house isn't baby-proofed. He works from home, has a side business with car repairs, and was planning to use PTO for a trip. \n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, originally leaving kids with the sister. But the sister's husband's family had an emergency, so she couldn't take them. Two days before the trip, the brother asked him to babysit. He refused, citing work, no baby-proofing, and the brother's no-marijuana rule. The brother and wife got angry, called him names, and posted on Facebook. The sister sides with them, but he argues it's not feasible.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Points to consider: \n\n1. Family obligations: Is it expected for him to help in an emergency? But the sister's unavailability is due to a family medical emergency, so maybe they were caught off-guard. However, they asked him two days before the trip, which might be too short notice. \n\n2. His responsibilities: He has his own work commitments, including booked repair appointments and needing to use PTO for a planned trip. Sacrificing that might be significant. \n\n3. The house not being safe and the no-marijuana rule: Valid reasons since the brother's conditions are strict. \n\n4. His dislike of children is mentioned upfront. The family is aware, so maybe they should have considered that when planning. \n\n5. The brother's reaction: Yelling, calling him names, public shaming. That's harsh, but does that reflect on the original refusal? Or is it the brother's overreaction?\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the key is whether the refusal was unreasonable. If the request was last-minute, and he had valid reasons, then he's not in the wrong. The brother's planning and backup plans (relying on sister) might have been flawed. Also, the sister's inability to help was a new development, but the brother should have had a contingency plan. \n\nHis refusal is based on realistic constraints: work, house safety, personal preferences. The brother's demands (get rid of weed, baby-proof in two days) are indeed unrealistic. So the author's position is justified. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
