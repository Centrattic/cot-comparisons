I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their siblings' kids. The author is 23, hates children, lives in a marijuana-legal state, works from home with a side business, and his house isn't baby-proofed. His brother asked two days before a cruise if he could watch the kids, and he said no. The brother's wife and sister are upset, and they called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to babysit: he hates kids, his house isn't safe, and he has work commitments. Also, they were supposed to leave the kids with their sister, but she couldn't. The brother asked last-minute, which is probably a problem. The author is saving PTO for a trip, and the brother's request involves him giving up PTO, moving his work setup, and baby-proofing in two days. \n\nBut then, how does the responsibility of family factor in? Is it expected for the author to help out even if it's inconvenient? The brother had planned the trip for five years, which adds weight to the request. However, the request came two days before, which is very short notice. The author is also not being paid, which could be a point against the brother's side. \n\nThe brother's reaction\u2014yelling for an hour, calling the author names, and ranting on Facebook\u2014seems excessive. The sister's opinion might not be valid since she thinks the author should watch them, but the situation seems unreasonable. \n\nThe author's reasons are practical: work, house safety, and personal dislike of kids. The brother's side didn't plan ahead, and the author is not obligated to accommodate such a last-minute request without prior arrangements. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while family support is important, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the request is unrealistic. The brother's reaction is more in the wrong, but the question is about the author. The author's refusal is justified given the circumstances. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
