I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old man refusing to babysit his brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the brother asked two days before their cruise. The author has a busy work schedule, uses marijuana often, and his house isn't baby-proofed. He's also saving PTO for a guys' trip. He said no and got yelled at, then called an asshole. The family is upset because the cruise was planned for five years.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, family obligations might be expected, especially for a significant event. But on the other hand, the author has valid reasons: he hates kids, his house isn't safe, he can't take time off without financial impact, and the request came last-minute. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially wanting him to throw out his marijuana and make the house safe in two days. The fact that he's in a state where marijuana is legal might be relevant, but maybe the brother is concerned about the kids' safety. However, the author's refusal is based on his inability and personal boundaries. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect someone to drop their plans, especially when they have work commitments and a dislike for children? The brother's five-year plan is understandable, but the timing and the specific request might not be fair. The author's responsibilities and personal life should be considered. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the request was last-minute, unrealistic, and he has valid reasons to decline. The brother's reaction is more over the top here.\n"
