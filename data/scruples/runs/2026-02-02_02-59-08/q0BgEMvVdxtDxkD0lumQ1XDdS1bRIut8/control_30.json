I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is 23, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. They have a job that allows marijuana use and work from home. They also have a side business with car repairs. The brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, but the author couldn't. They cited reasons like not having a safe house for kids, needing to use PTO for work, and the brother's unreasonable demands (like getting rid of marijuana and babyproofing quickly).\n\nThe brother and his wife reacted angrily, calling the author names and ranting online. The author's sister is also pushing them to help. The key points here are the timing of the request, the author's personal circumstances, and the brother's demands.\n\nThe author clearly stated their position in advance that they hate kids and their house isn't safe. The brother's request came last-minute, which makes it hard for the author to adjust their schedule and living conditions. The author has valid reasons: work commitments, personal preferences, and the impracticality of the brother's demands (like removing all marijuana and babyproofing in two days).\n\nThe brother's reaction seems excessive. Demanding that the author should make time just because they're family, especially when the author has given prior notice about their stance on kids and their living situation, isn't fair. The author isn't obligated to accommodate such a last-minute request, especially when it's not feasible. The brother's use of social media to rant and call the author names is also problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They had legitimate reasons for declining, and the brother's response was unreasonable. The author's refusal isn't selfish if there's no feasible way to comply, especially with such short notice and conflicting demands.\n"
