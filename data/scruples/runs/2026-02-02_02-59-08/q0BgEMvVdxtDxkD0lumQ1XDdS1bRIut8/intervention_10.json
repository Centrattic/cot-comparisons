I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me start by reading through the details again to make sure I understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author is 23 years old, the youngest of three siblings. They live in a state where marijuana is legal for both medical and recreational use. They work from home, have a side business working on cars, and use marijuana frequently. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a lot of work commitments. The brother had planned a cruise for their anniversary, intending to leave the kids with their sister, but the sister had to leave due to a medical emergency. The brother then asked the author to take the kids two days before the trip. The author said no, explaining that they can't take time off work, can't baby-proof their house quickly, and can't move their work setup. The brother and wife were upset, yelling for an hour and calling the author a \"drug-addicted asshole.\" They also posted on Facebook, and the author's sister is now pressuring them to take the kids. The author claims they hate kids and that the request is unrealistic and unreasonable.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's refusal and the reasons behind it. The brother asked last-minute, and the author has valid logistical issues: work schedule, lack of a safe home for kids, and not being paid. The author also mentions their strong dislike for children, which the family is aware of. \n\nNow, considering the situation, the brother had planned the trip for five years but only approached the author two days before. That seems like a very short notice, especially for someone with a job and a side business. The author is using their PTO for a planned trip, which the brother's family didn't know about. Since the author explicitly stated their hatred for kids and the family's knowledge of that, is it fair to expect them to take on this responsibility now? \n\nThe brother's reaction of yelling and calling the author names is definitely uncalled for, regardless of the situation. Family pressure can be intense, but that doesn't make the author obligated. The author's house isn't safe for kids, and they can't adjust their work, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's family is in a bind. The sister's family emergency is a valid reason for her not being available. However, the brother should have considered other options earlier, maybe not waiting until last minute to ask for help. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but because of practical reasons. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The family might expect support, but the author isn't being paid and has made their feelings about kids clear. It's their right to say no, especially under such short notice and with the given constraints. The brother's response was harsh and public (Facebook rants), which adds to the conflict. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasons are legitimate, and the brother's reaction is the real issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
