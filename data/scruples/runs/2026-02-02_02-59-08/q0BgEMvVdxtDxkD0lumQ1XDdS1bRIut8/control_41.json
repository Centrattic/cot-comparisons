I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of r/childfree, and really hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a job and a side business (working on cars) that they can't just drop. \n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, which they\u2019d been saving for five years. They were supposed to leave the kids with their sister, but the sister had to leave for a family emergency. So, two days before the trip, the brother asks the author to babysit. The author says no because they can't take time off work (using PTO they saved for a guys' trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't cancel repair appointments. The brother and wife get angry, call the author a drug-addicted asshole, and rant on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have said yes.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author has a valid reason for not being able to take care of the kids\u2014work commitments, personal preferences, and an unsafe living environment. The brother asked last-minute, and the request was unrealistic. The author didn't have prior arrangements to babysit and clearly communicated their inability. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially after the author explained the reasons. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother and sister seem to expect the author to drop everything despite knowing their dislike for kids and current commitments. The author's refusal is based on legitimate constraints. The brother's cruise is important to them, but it's their responsibility to plan ahead and have a backup plan. The author isn't obligated to accommodate last-minute requests that conflict with their personal and professional life. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and communicated them clearly. The brother's reaction is unreasonable given the circumstances.\n"
