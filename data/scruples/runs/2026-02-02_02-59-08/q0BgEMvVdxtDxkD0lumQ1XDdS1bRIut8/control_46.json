I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a 23-year-old male, youngest of three siblings, and he's part of the r/childfree community, which suggests he's childless and possibly doesn't want to have kids. He really hates children and his family knows that. He lives in a state where marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use. He works from home and is okay with using marijuana, which he does quite often. He also has a side business working on cars. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he's busy with work, so taking on kids isn't feasible.\n\nNow, his brother is going on a week-long cruise for their anniversary, and they originally planned to leave the kids with their sister. But the sister had to leave for a medical emergency, so they asked the author two days before the trip. He said no because he can't take time off work (needs to use PTO he was saving for a guy's trip), his house isn't safe for kids, and he can't reschedule repair appointments. The brother and his wife got angry, called him a drug-addicted, useless asshole, and ranted on Facebook. The sister thinks he should have agreed, even though it's not realistic for him.\n\nThe question is, is the author the asshole here? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author made it clear he doesn't like kids and his house isn't safe. He has work commitments (both main job and car repair side job). He wasn't given advance notice (only two days), which is a short time to prepare. The brother's request would require him to use PTO, which he was saving for his own trip. Also, the brother and wife are asking him to get rid of his marijuana and baby-proof the house in two days. \n\nFrom a basic standpoint, the author is under no obligation to babysit. However, the brother had the cruise planned for five years, which makes the situation seem urgent. But the author is in a position where he can't realistically do it. His house isn't safe, and he has prior work commitments. The brother and wife's reaction seems harsh. They waited until two days before to ask, which is very short notice, and then blamed him for not being able to accommodate. \n\nThe sister's opinion is that he should have watched them, but the author is right that there's no feasible way without significant sacrifice. The brother's cruise is important, but the author's time and personal space are also valid. The fact that they called him a drug addict and an asshole, and posted on Facebook, might indicate they overreacted. \n\nThe author is single, has his own life, and his reasons are practical. He's not in a position to take on such a responsibility, especially with the short notice and his existing plans. The brother and wife didn't have a backup plan until the last minute, which is on them. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He had legitimate reasons to say no, and the brother's reaction was unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
