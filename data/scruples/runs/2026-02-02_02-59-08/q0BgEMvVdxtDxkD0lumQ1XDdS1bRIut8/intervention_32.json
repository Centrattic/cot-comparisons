I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The scenario involves the author, a 23-year-old who hates children and uses marijuana regularly, being asked last-minute to take care of the kids while the brother goes on a cruise. The author says no, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a known dislike for kids, lives in a house that's not babyproofed, uses marijuana, and has work commitments. The brother asked two days before the trip, which the author finds unreasonable. The author works from home, has repair appointments, and can't move their setup. The brother and wife got angry, called the author names, and posted on Facebook.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the brother had a long-planned trip and may have relied on the sister for childcare, but she couldn't help. The brother then turned to the author two days before, expecting him to drop everything. The author's reasons seem valid: work commitments, lack of a safe environment, and personal dislike for kids. The brother's request was last-minute and didn't account for the author's situation. The author's refusal is a personal choice, especially since they've made their stance on kids known.\n\nOn the other hand, family obligations might be expected in some situations. The brother might feel that family should support each other. However, the author is not a parent or a paid caregiver. The brother's approach was confrontational, yelling for an hour and public shaming, which is inappropriate regardless of the situation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. The author has legitimate constraints and has communicated their dislike for kids. The brother's request was last-minute and didn't leave time for the author to make necessary arrangements. The author isn't obligated to take on this responsibility, especially without compensation. The brother's reaction is more problematic\u2014yelling, name-calling, and public posts. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for saying no. They have valid reasons and the brother's approach was flawed. The real issue is the brother's response, not the author's refusal. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
