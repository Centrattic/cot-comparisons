I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The situation seems pretty clear. Let's start with the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of a family where they have three siblings. They openly dislike kids and their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they don't have the space or time due to work commitments, including PTO days they were saving for a trip. The brother asked two days before the cruise, which was planned for five years, and the author refused. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to determine if that's accurate. Let's consider the responsibilities and expectations in a family context. Family members often expect each other to help out, especially in emergencies or when plans are made. However, the brother asked two days before the cruise, which is a very short notice. The author has valid reasons: their house isn't safe for kids, they use marijuana regularly, and they have work commitments. The brother's request would require the author to rearrange their work, possibly lose PTO, and adjust their living situation quickly, which is unrealistic.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a family member. The author is the youngest and might have been expected to step in since the sister couldn't due to her husband's family emergency. However, the author's reasons are legitimate. They have a right to their living situation and work schedule. The brother's reaction\u2014yelling, calling names, and public rants\u2014seems excessive. The author isn't obligated to provide childcare without proper notice and under such conditions.\n\nAnother angle is the brother's responsibility. Maybe he should have planned ahead and not left it until the last minute. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but due to practical constraints. The brother's use of the term \"crotch goblins\" shows disrespect towards the kids, which might indicate that the kids aren't easy to handle, making the author's reluctance even more reasonable.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their inability to help and had valid reasons. The brother's reaction is more inappropriate. The author isn't a drug addict; they use marijuana legally in a state where it's allowed. The house not being babyproofed isn't their fault if it's their home and they didn't have prior notice of needing to accommodate kids.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The brother's actions are more questionable, and the author's refusal is justified. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
