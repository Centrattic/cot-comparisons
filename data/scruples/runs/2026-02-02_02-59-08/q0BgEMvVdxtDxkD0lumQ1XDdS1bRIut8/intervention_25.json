I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The person wrote an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post where they explain that they hate children, their house isn't babyproofed, they use marijuana, and they can't take time off work. Their brother asked last-minute to watch the kids for a week, which they declined, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the author's refusal is justified. Family obligations can be a gray area. The author is 23, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and has a job that allows its use. They have a side business with car repairs. The brother wanted them to watch the kids two days before the cruise, but the author can't spare the time, can't babyproof the house quickly, and can't cancel appointments. The brother and sister-in-law reacted angrily, calling the author a drug addict and an asshole, even ranting on Facebook. The sister is also pressuring the author.\n\nI should consider factors like notice time, the reason for refusal, and whether there's a realistic way to accommodate. The brother asked two days before the trip, which is very short notice. The author's house isn't safe for kids, and they have work commitments. They also mention their dislike of children, which the family knows. The brother's expectation that family should drop everything to help might be unreasonable, but the author's refusal might be seen as not being a team player. However, the brother's response (yelling, calling names, public shaming) seems excessive. \n\nThe key points: The author had a valid reason (work, safety, personal dislike) and the brother's request was last-minute. The author's refusal isn't out of malice but practicality. The brother's reaction is more extreme. In AITA scenarios, the person is often the asshole if they act selfishly or without valid reason. Here, the author has valid reasons, so they might not be the asshole. The brother's unreasonable expectations and harsh reaction might make him the asshole instead. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
