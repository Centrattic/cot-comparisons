I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author refusing to babysit his brother's kids. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. The family knows this. He smokes marijuana, which is legal where he lives, and his job allows it since he works from home. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he's busy with work, including a side business fixing cars. \n\nHis brother wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, but the original plan was to leave the kids with their sister. However, the sister had to leave for a family emergency, so they turned to the author two days before the trip. The author said no, explaining he can't take time off work, can't baby-proof his house quickly, and can't cancel repair appointments. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called him names, and posted about it on Facebook. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's consider responsibilities and expectations in family situations. The brother planned this trip for five years, and the author is their last option. But the author has valid reasons: he doesn't like kids, his house isn't safe, he can't take time off, and he's not getting paid. Also, the request was last-minute, which makes it even harder to accommodate. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially using derogatory language and public shaming.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes family expects support, but that doesn't mean unreasonable demands. The author isn't obligated to help if it's a significant burden. The brother's demands to remove all marijuana and baby-proof in two days are unrealistic. The author's refusal isn't neglect, just a realistic assessment of his capabilities. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's upfront about his limitations, and the brother's reaction is over the top. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice his time and resources for a last-minute request without compensation. The answer should be B.\n"
