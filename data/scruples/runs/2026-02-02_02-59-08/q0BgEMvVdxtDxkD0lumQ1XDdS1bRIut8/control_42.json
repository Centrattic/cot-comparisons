I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Their reasons include hating children, not having a safe house, working from home with a side job, needing PTO for their own plans, and the last-minute request.\n\nFirst, the brother asked two days before the cruise. That's really short notice. Babysitting for a week would require significant preparation, like childproofing a house and rearranging work. The author mentions they work from home and have repair appointments scheduled, so there's a legitimate conflict. Plus, they have a right to their space and time, especially considering their dislike for kids and the fact that the house isn't safe.\n\nThe brother and his wife got upset, called the author a drug addict and an asshole. That's aggressive. The author's refusal is based on realistic constraints, not just laziness. They also mentioned they're in a state where marijuana is legal, so that's not an illegal issue. The request to throw out their weed and make the house safe in two days is impractical. \n\nThe sister's opinion isn't enough to make the author wrong. The key factors are the short notice, the author's personal circumstances, and the unreasonable demands from the brother. The author isn't obligated to fulfill a last-minute request that disrupts their life and work without compensation. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
