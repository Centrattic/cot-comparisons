I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids.\n\nFirst, the author is 23 years old, part of the childfree community, and openly states they hate children. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they use marijuana regularly. The brother asked for help last minute, two days before the trip, which was planned for five years. The author has work commitments and can't move their setup, plus they were saving PTO for a trip. The brother and his wife reacted angrily, even calling the author names and ranting on Facebook.\n\nSo, the key points here: the request is last-minute (two days before), the author has valid reasons (work, house not safe, personal preferences), the brother's family had an emergency that changed the original plan. The author says \"no\" and the other side is upset. \n\nIs the author wrong for saying no? Well, they didn't force the request on the brother. They have legitimate reasons. The brother had an emergency that prevented using their sister, which complicates things. But they could have planned better. The author isn't obligated to help, especially with such short notice and their own constraints. The brother's reaction seems over the top, yelling, calling names, using Facebook rants. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their refusal, had valid reasons, and the request was unreasonable given the circumstances. The brother's anger and public shaming are problematic. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
