I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The author is 23, part of r/childfree, hates kids, and smokes weed. The brother asked two days before a cruise, which they planned for five years. The author's house isn't baby-proof, they can't take time off work, and the brother's wife is upset they didn't know earlier. The author says they can't manage the kids, and the brother and sister-in-law called them an asshole.\n\nHmm. So, is the author wrong? Let's see. The brother asked last minute, which is probably a problem. If the author had known earlier, maybe they could have arranged something. But the author has a valid point about their house not being safe and their work commitments. Also, the author isn't paid, and using PTO for a guys' trip in two months was a planned expense. \n\nThe brother's side expected the author to drop everything, including moving their work setup, which isn't feasible. The author's refusal seems reasonable given the circumstances. The brother's reaction of yelling and calling them names might be the more problematic part. The author's position is that they can't help, which they have rights to, especially if they made it clear they don't like kids and their home isn't suitable. \n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated their stance earlier. If the brother planned the trip for five years, maybe the author should have informed them earlier that they wouldn't be available. However, the author might not have wanted to take care of kids even if given more notice. Also, the brother didn't check with the author before planning with their sister, which might be an oversight. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their personal space and time, especially with valid reasons. The brother's demand for last-minute help without prior communication might be the bigger issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
