I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. They have a job that allows working from home, but they need to use PTO for a guys' trip. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they use marijuana regularly. The brother asked two days before the cruise, which is a five-year plan. The author said no because they can't rearrange their work, can't make their house safe, and can't give up their PTO. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have helped.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author isn't a parent, they have valid reasons (work, house safety, PTO savings), they have a known dislike for kids, and the request was last-minute. The brother had a backup plan with their sister, but that fell through. The author isn't being paid and is sacrificing their own plans. The brother's reaction seems harsh, but the author's refusal is understandable given their constraints.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for declining. The brother didn't plan ahead and should have had a better backup plan. The author isn't obligated to help, especially with such short notice and personal sacrifices. The fact that they even considered it and then declined respectfully makes sense. The brother's response is more extreme, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
