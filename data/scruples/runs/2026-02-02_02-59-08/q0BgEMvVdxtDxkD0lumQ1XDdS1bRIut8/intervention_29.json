I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the r/childfree subreddit, and openly hates children. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, both medically and recreationally. They work from home and have a side business working on cars. They smoke often, their house isn't babyproofed, and they can't take time off work. \n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary but asked the author last minute, two days before the trip, to watch the kids. The author said no because they can't take time off their job (using PTO they were saving for a guys' trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't move their work setup. The brother and wife got upset, yelled at them, called them names, and ranted on Facebook. The author's sister is now pressuring them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks they are, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key factors here are the timing of the request, the author's circumstances, and the family dynamics.\n\nThe brother asked two days before the trip, which seems extremely short notice. Most people would probably need more time to prepare, especially if they have their own commitments. The author has a valid reason for not being able to take the kids: their job requires them to work from home, they can't take PTO, they have repair appointments scheduled, and their house isn't safe for kids. Plus, they have a known dislike for children, which might affect their ability to care for them even if they tried.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother had planned this trip for five years, which is significant. But the timing was terrible. The author didn't know about the sister's situation until two days before, so maybe the brother should have planned more carefully. Also, the author's refusal is based on real constraints, not just personal dislike. The brother's reaction\u2014yelling, calling names, Facebook rants\u2014seems harsh and unproductive.\n\nThe author's sister is involved, but she had her own family emergency, so maybe the brother should have considered that before making a last-minute request. The brother's expectation that the author should drop everything, including work and personal plans, and even change their lifestyle (throwing out marijuana, babyproofing the house) in two days is unrealistic. The author isn't being selfless, but they have legitimate reasons. \n\nIn terms of family obligations, there's no obligation to babysit unless there's a prior agreement. The brother didn't plan ahead, and the request is unreasonable given the short notice. The author's refusal is justified. The brother and wife overreacted, which makes the author seem less in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The author had valid reasons and the brother's request was unrealistic. The brother's reaction was inappropriate. The author isn't being selfish without cause; they have real constraints that make it impossible. The key points here are the short notice, the author's inability to accommodate due to work and living conditions, and the brother's harsh response. The author isn't obligated to help under those circumstances.\n"
