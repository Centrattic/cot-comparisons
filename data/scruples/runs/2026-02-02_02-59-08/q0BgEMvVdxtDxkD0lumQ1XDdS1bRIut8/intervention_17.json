I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is being asked if they're in the wrong for refusing to babysit their siblings' kids. The author is 23, hates children, lives in a house that's not safe for them, and uses marijuana regularly. Their brother asked last minute to watch the kids so they can go on a cruise they've planned for five years. The author says no because they can't take time off work, can't make their house safe, and the kids would be in an environment with drugs.\n\nFirst, the timing is really tight\u2014two days before the trip. That's not much notice for someone to prepare. The author has a valid point about the house not being child-safe and their work commitments. They also mention they're not paid, which adds to the burden. Their job allows marijuana use, but the brother's kids can't be around that. So there's a conflict there.\n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh. Yelling for an hour and calling the author names over a last-minute request that's not feasible is probably their own issue. The author's reasons are practical and personal. They've made their stance on kids clear, so the family should know. The sister's opinion isn't as important if the request is unreasonable. The key points are the short notice, the impracticality of the request, and the family's disrespectful response. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here.\n"
