I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really dislikes kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have a work setup at home. They already have commitments and were saving PTO for a trip.\n\nThe brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, but the author said no. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister sides with them. The author argues that the request is unrealistic given their work schedule, the need to make the house safe, and the marijuana in the house. They also mention the lack of payment and the last-minute notice.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the last-minute notice, the author's personal preferences (hating kids, using marijuana), and the practical issues of their house not being safe. The brother had planned the trip for five years but only asked two days beforehand, which is a very short notice. The author has valid reasons for not being able to do it: work commitments, the house setup, and personal boundaries. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially yelling and public shaming.\n\nThe question is about the author's responsibility. Since the author made their stance clear (hating kids, house not safe, work obligations) and the request was last-minute, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They can't be expected to drop everything or change their living conditions on such short notice. The brother might have been responsible for planning a backup earlier. The author's refusal is based on legitimate reasons, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
