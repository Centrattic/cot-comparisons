I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to babysit siblings' kids. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, a member of a child-free community, hates kids, and uses marijuana. Their brother asked last-minute to watch the kids, but the author can't because their house isn't safe, they have work commitments, and they don't want to use PTO. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author names, and the author's sister is pressuring them. The author thinks it's unfair because the request is unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author's reasons for refusal\u2014hating kids, house safety, work obligations, not being paid. The brother had planned the cruise for five years but only asked two days before. The author's argument is that the timing is bad and the request is impractical.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, family can expect some support, but the author has valid reasons. They're not being asked to do this regularly, just a last-minute request. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them names and ranting on Facebook. The author isn't in a position to accommodate, and the brother's needs don't outweigh the author's responsibilities and comfort. Also, the author's hatred of kids is a personal choice, and while it might be seen as extreme, it's their right to live their life as they choose.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. The refusal is justified due to practical reasons and personal boundaries. The brother's reaction was disproportionate.\n"
