I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the youngest of three siblings. They hate children, a fact known to the family. They live in a state where marijuana is legal and they use it often. They work from home and have a side business with car repairs. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have scheduled work that they can't cancel. The brother wanted them to take the kids for a week-long cruise two days before the trip. The author said no, leading to an argument where the brother and wife called them a \"useless, drug addicted asshole\" and posted about it on Facebook. The sister is pressuring them, but the author can't make the house safe or rearrange their work schedule. \n\nSo, the key points are: the brother asked last minute, the author has valid reasons (work, unprepared house, dislike of kids), and the brother's reaction was harsh. The author is in a situation where they can't realistically fulfill the request without significant sacrifice. \n\nThe brother had planned the trip for five years, but asking two days before is really short notice. The author isn't being paid, which might be a factor. Also, the author's living situation isn't suitable for kids. They have repair appointments that can't be canceled, and their job uses PTO that they were saving for another trip. \n\nThe brother's demands\u2014throwing out marijuana and babyproofing in two days\u2014seem extreme. The author's refusal is based on practical issues, not just personal dislike. Even though they're family, the request is unrealistic. The brother's reaction was unkind and public, which might indicate they overreacted. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother should have had a backup plan, especially since their sister was supposed to help but had to leave. The author isn't obligated to drop everything, and their reasons are legitimate. The author's dislike of kids is a personal choice, but the main issue is the feasibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The brother and wife handled it poorly. The answer should be B.\n"
