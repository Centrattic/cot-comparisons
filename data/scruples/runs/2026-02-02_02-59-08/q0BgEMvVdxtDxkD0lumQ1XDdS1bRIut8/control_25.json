I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, single, works from home, and has a side business with car repairs. They're part of the childfree community and really dislike kids. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they use marijuana regularly, which is legal where they live. Their job allows recreational use, but they can't have kids around because of the drugs and the unsafe environment.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise with his wife for their anniversary. Originally, they were going to leave the kids with their sister, but she had to leave for a family emergency. Two days before the trip, they ask the author to babysit. The author says no because they can't take a week off work (using PTO they saved for a guys' trip), their house isn't safe, and they can't stop using marijuana. The brother and his wife get angry, call the author names, and rant online. The sister thinks the author should help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's personal preferences (hating kids, marijuana use), the short notice, the logistical issues (work, house safety), and the family's reaction.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The author clearly communicated their inability to take on the responsibility. They have valid reasons: work commitments, house not being safe, and personal boundaries. The brother and sister-in-law's request was last-minute and didn't account for the author's situation. The author isn't obligated to help, especially since it's a significant sacrifice without compensation. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially given the author's explanation of why it's not feasible.\n\nThe sister's expectation might come from family pressure, but the author isn't at fault for setting boundaries. The brother's cruise was their own planning, and they should have considered alternatives in advance. The author's refusal isn't about being an asshole but about realistic constraints. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
