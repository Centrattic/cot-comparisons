I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The context is that the author is 23, hates children, doesn't have a safe house for kids, smokes a lot, and has work commitments. The brother asked two days before a cruise, and the author said no. The parents are upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's refusal is justified. The key factors here are the author's personal preferences (hating kids), the lack of a safe environment, the use of marijuana, and the timing of the request. The parents are asking for a week-long sit, which is a big commitment. The author mentioned they have scheduled repair appointments and can't use their PTO because it's saved for another trip. \n\nThe parents might feel that as family, the author should be available, but the author has valid reasons. The house isn't baby-proofed, and the author's job allows marijuana use. The parents' demand to remove the OG and make the house safe in two days seems unreasonable. The author's sister is pressuring them, but maybe the parents should have considered the author's situation earlier. \n\nAlso, the author is a frequent member of a child-free subreddit, so their stance on kids is known. The parents changing the plan last minute might be part of the issue. The author's refusal is based on practicality and personal discomfort, which could outweigh the expectation of family obligation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they provided clear, valid reasons. The parents should have planned ahead and considered the author's capabilities. The author isn't obligated to do something they're uncomfortable with or that interferes with their work and personal plans. So the answer is B.\n"
