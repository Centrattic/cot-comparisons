I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old man who's part of the child-free community and openly states he hates kids. His family is aware of this. He lives in a state where marijuana is legal, both medicinally and recreationally. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he smokes regularly. He works from home with a job that allows for marijuana use, and he has a side business working on cars.\n\nThe situation is that his brother asked him two days before a week-long cruise to watch his kids. The brother had initially planned to leave the kids with their sister, but the sister couldn't because of a family emergency. The author refused, citing that he can't take a week off work (needs PTO), can't move his work setup, has scheduled repair appointments, and his house isn't safe for kids. Additionally, the brother and his wife want no marijuana in the house during the stay.\n\nThe brother and wife got angry, called him names, and posted about him on Facebook. The sister is pressuring him to take the kids. The author argues that the request is unrealistic and that he's not being fair to himself to sacrifice his time and resources for their cruise, which he wasn't involved in planning.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Advance Notice**: The brother asked two days before the trip. If they had planned this earlier, they might have considered other options. Last-minute requests are harder to accommodate, especially for a week-long commitment.\n\n2. **Author's Capabilities**: The author has a job, a side business, and is not set up to care for children. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he uses marijuana, which the parents don't want around their kids. These are valid reasons for refusal. It's not his responsibility to suddenly change his living situation or work schedule.\n\n3. **Expectations of Family**: While family often expects help, that's not a given. The parents are asking for a significant favor without offering compensation. The author is saving PTO for a planned trip himself, which he's within his rights to do.\n\n4. **Respect and Communication**: The parents reacted angrily, called him names, and posted about him. This aggression might indicate they overstepped. The author clearly communicated his inability to help, so there's no hidden expectation.\n\n5. **Personal Boundaries**: The author has personal boundaries regarding children and his lifestyle. It's reasonable to honor those unless there's a prior agreement. No one is obligated to provide childcare for family unless they've committed to it in advance.\n\n6. **Sister's Role**: The sister is being pressured to take them, but she can't due to her own issues. They might need to find another solution, like a professional service or reconsidering the trip.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. He provided valid reasons for refusal, communicated clearly, and the request was last-minute and impractical. The parents' reaction is more indicative of their own inconsideration than the author's wrongdoing.\n"
