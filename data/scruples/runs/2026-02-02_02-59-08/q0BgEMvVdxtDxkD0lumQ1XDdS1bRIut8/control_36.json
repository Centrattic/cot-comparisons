I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. \n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of r/childfree, and hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and their home isn't babyproofed. They work from home but have repair appointments scheduled. They were asked two days before the cruise, which they can't accommodate because they can't take PTO, can't move their work setup, and can't make the house safe in time. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them a drug addict, and posted about them on Facebook. The sister thinks they should help.\n\nSo, the key points are: the request was last-minute, the author's personal preferences (hating kids, using marijuana), and the practical impossibility of making their house safe. The brother had planned the trip for five years, but the request was only two days in advance. The author has legitimate reasons\u2014work commitments, lack of space, and setup. Also, the brother's reaction was harsh, calling them names and using social media to rant.\n\nLegally, in the US, there's no obligation to babysit family unless there's a specific contract, which there isn't. Ethically, family obligations can be tricky. But the author's reasons seem valid. They have their own life and responsibilities. The brother's request was unrealistic given the short notice and the author's situation. The fact that the author is drug use and the house isn't safe adds to the impracticality. The brother's anger and public shaming might indicate they overreacted, but the question is about the author's wrongness.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had valid reasons to decline, and the timing and circumstances made it impossible. The brother's expectations were unreasonable given the short notice and the author's stated constraints. So the answer should be B.\n"
