I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of r/childfree, and openly hates children. Their family knows this. They live in a state where medical and recreational marijuana is legal, and they use it. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they work from home with a side job in car repairs. They have scheduled repair appointments during the week the brother asked for help. \n\nThe brother planned a cruise for his anniversary, had the kids with their sister, but she left due to a family emergency. Two days before the trip, the brother asks the author to babysit. The author refuses, explaining they can't take time off work (using PTO for a planned trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't stop using marijuana. The brother and his wife get angry, accuse the author of being a drug addict and a useless family member, and rant on Facebook. The sister sides with them, but the author argues that the request is unreasonable.\n\nNow, considering the details. The author has given the brother ample notice that they hate kids and aren't in a position to care for them. They have prior commitments and valid reasons for refusal. The brother asked two days before the trip, which is very short notice. The author might not have had time to make their house safe or adjust their schedule. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling the author names and public shaming. \n\nThe key points are the short notice, the author's valid reasons (PTO for a planned trip, work commitments, safety of the house, and personal preferences), and the brother's unrealistic expectations. The author isn't obligated to babysit, especially since it's their own home. The brother should have had a backup plan, not relying last-minute on someone who isn't a caregiver. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they made their stance clear and have legitimate reasons for refusal. The brother's reaction is disproportionate. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
