I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. I need to figure out whether the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. They have a job that allows them to work from home, including using marijuana, which is legal. They have a side business working on cars. Their brother and sister-in-law wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary but had to change their original babysitter because their sister had to leave for a family emergency. Two days before the trip, they ask the author to watch their kids. The author refuses because they can't take time off work, their house isn't babyproofed, and they don't want to give up their vacation days for a guys' trip. The brother and sister then get angry, call the author names, and post on Facebook. The author is asking if they're the asshole for refusing.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author has made it clear they hate kids and don't want them, which their family knows. They have a valid reason for not being able to take the kids: their house isn't safe, they have work commitments, and they aren't being paid. The brother and sister asked last minute, which is a problem. However, the author's refusal is based on their genuine inability and unwillingness to take care of kids. The brother and sister's reaction seems harsh, especially the name-calling and public shaming.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, family obligations can be a gray area. The author is not obligated to provide childcare, especially since they've already communicated their dislike for kids. The brother and sister could be seen as not planning ahead and relying on last-minute help. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but practical reasons. The fact that the author isn't being paid and has work commitments that they can't reschedule adds to their justification. The brother and sister's reaction is more extreme, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for saying no. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable. The author's refusal is reasonable given their situation. They're not being cruel, just being honest about their limitations. The family's expectation might be unreasonable, expecting them to drop everything without notice. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
