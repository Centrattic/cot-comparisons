I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 23-year-old single man, refuses to babysit his brother's kids for a week. His brother and sister-in-law had planned a cruise for five years and asked him two days before they were supposed to leave. The author says he can't do it because he works from home, has a busy schedule with his side business, doesn't have a kid-safe environment, and uses marijuana, which they don't want around the kids. He also mentions he was saving PTO for a guys' trip and doesn't want to cancel repair appointments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of family responsibilities. Is it reasonable for the brother to ask for last-minute help? They had the trip planned for five years, but they only asked two days in advance. That seems really short notice, which might make it unfair to expect the author to drop everything. Also, the author has his own commitments and a job that's not flexible. If they had asked earlier, maybe he could have made different arrangements, but two days isn't much time.\n\nThen there's the fact that the author has made his dislike of children clear. He's part of a child-free subreddit and openly says he hates kids. The family knows this, so maybe they shouldn't have expected him to be the go-to babysitter. But sometimes family still expects help even if someone isn't the ideal person. However, if they knew his stance beforehand, maybe they should have planned accordingly.\n\nAnother point is the house not being kid-safe. If the kids are there, he has to make significant changes, which is a lot to ask on short notice. Plus, they want him to get rid of his marijuana, which he might be uncomfortable with. The brother and sister-in-law's reaction is pretty harsh\u2014yelling for an hour, calling him names, and ranting on Facebook. That seems excessive, especially if the author was honest about his reasons.\n\nThe question is whether refusing is being in the wrong. The author provided clear reasons: time constraints, work commitments, unsuitable environment, and personal preferences. The parents had the responsibility to plan in advance and find alternative childcare. Since they only asked at the last minute and the author's situation isn't flexible, he's not obligated to say yes. The parents' anger and public shaming might indicate they overreacted, which could mean the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is likely B, No.\n"
