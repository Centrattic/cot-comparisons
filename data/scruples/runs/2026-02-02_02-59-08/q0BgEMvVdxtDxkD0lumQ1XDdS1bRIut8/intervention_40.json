I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 23-year-old man who's part of the child-free community and really dislikes kids. His family knows this. He lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and he uses it a lot. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he has a side job working on cars that requires him to work from home. \n\nHis brother and his wife were planning a week-long cruise for their anniversary. They originally wanted their sister to watch the kids, but she couldn't because her husband's family had a medical emergency. So two days before the trip, they asked the author if he could take the kids. He said no because he can't take time off work, he was saving his PTO for a guys' trip, his house isn't kid-safe, and he has repair appointments scheduled. The brother and his wife got angry, yelled at him for an hour, called him a drug-addicted asshole, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister now thinks he should have done it. The author is asking if he's an asshole for refusing.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)? \n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. He has a clear dislike for children, which is known. His environment is not suitable for kids\u2014no baby-proofing, and he uses marijuana, which the in-laws don't want around the kids. He has work commitments he can't just cancel, and he's not getting paid. The request came very last minute, two days before the trip. The author is a single adult who has his own life and commitments, and he's not a parent or guardian. \n\nOn the other side, the brother and his wife had a five-year plan for this cruise, which is a significant event. They asked the author at the last minute when their usual childcare option (the sister) was unavailable. They wanted the kids in a safe environment, and the author's house doesn't meet that. They also wanted him to remove his marijuana and baby-proof the house in two days, which the author deemed unrealistic. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially since it's last minute and his house isn't suitable. He's a 23-year-old who's making a living, has his own work, and has communicated his dislike for kids. The brother and wife's reaction seems harsh, as they're expecting him to make significant personal sacrifices (time, PTO, changing his environment) without compensation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as family, the author should have stepped up, even if it's inconvenient. But the key points are the lack of notice, the unsuitability of the environment, and the author's prior dislike for children. The parents are also aware of his stance on kids and his living situation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while family often expects help, there's a limit, especially when it's not feasible. The author isn't a parent or a primary caregiver, so expecting him to take on this responsibility without prior arrangement is unreasonable. The parents' response\u2014yelling, calling names, and public shaming\u2014also seems excessive. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The request was unreasonable given the circumstances, and the parents overreacted. The author had valid reasons to say no, and the fact that they knew about his preferences beforehand makes their anger less justified.\n"
