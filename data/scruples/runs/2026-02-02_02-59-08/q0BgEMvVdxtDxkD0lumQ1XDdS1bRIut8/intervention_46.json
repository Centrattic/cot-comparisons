I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. Their house isn't babyproofed. They have a job that allows some flexibility with marijuana use, but they can't just uproot their work setup. The brother asked two days before a cruise they've planned for five years. The author says no because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a guys trip), their house isn't safe, and they can't move their work. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author a drug addict, and ranted on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should help.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case. Let's consider the key points.\n\nThe brother gave notice two days before the trip. That's very short notice. Even if the author wanted to help, preparing a house to be kid-safe and rearranging work would be tough, especially if they have scheduled appointments. The author's job requires them to be at home, and using PTO for this would interfere with their personal plans (the guys trip). The brother's request seems to come up last minute, which is on them for not planning ahead. The author's reasons for refusal are valid: work commitments, house safety, personal dislike of kids, and the fact that they weren't paid. The brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming is also a red flag. The author didn't owe them this help, especially without prior arrangement. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
