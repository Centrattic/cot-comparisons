I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal. They have a job that allows working from home and using marijuana, which they do frequently. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a side business working on cars.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise for his anniversary, originally leaving the kids with their sister. But the sister had to leave for a family emergency, so they asked the author two days before the trip. The author said no, explaining they can't take time off work (using PTO for a guys' trip in two months), the house isn't safe, and they can't stop their repair appointments. The brother and wife got angry, called the author a drug addict and useless, and posted on Facebook. The sister feels the author should have helped.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They made their dislike for kids clear. They have a valid reason for not being able to take the kids\u2014work commitments, house safety, and personal preferences. They were asked on short notice, which makes it harder to comply. They didn't agree to the request, which is their right. The brother's reaction seems harsh; yelling, name-calling, public shaming on Facebook. The author isn't obligated to take in the kids unless there's a prior agreement or legal obligation. \n\nFrom the brother's perspective: They had a significant trip planned and needed help. They expected family support, which is common, but they gave short notice. They might feel the author should be more flexible as family. However, the author's explanation is legitimate. \n\nConsidering the author's reasons\u2014personal preference, work, safety\u2014it's reasonable to refuse. The brother's reaction is more questionable, being aggressive and public. The sister's opinion is mentioned but not the main issue. The key is whether refusing assistance is morally wrong. Since the author provided valid reasons and the request was last-minute, it's not the author's fault. The brother's response is more in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
