I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author, a 23-year-old guy, refusing to babysit his brother's kids for a week. The brother had planned a cruise and asked two days before, but the author said no. The author has several reasons: he hates kids, his house isn't babyproof, he works from home and uses marijuana (which isn't allowed when the kids are there), and he can't reschedule his work or cancel appointments. The brother and his wife got angry, called him names, and posted about him on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timing. The brother asked two days before the trip. That's really short notice. The author has a valid point about not being able to prepare his house for kids in two days, especially if it's not babyproof. Also, the author mentions he's saving PTO for a planned trip, which is in two months. Using PTO last minute might not be feasible. \n\nThen there's the issue of the author's lifestyle. He smokes marijuana, which the brother's family doesn't want around the kids. Since the family knows he dislikes kids, maybe they should have planned ahead and not asked him last minute. The author isn't in a position where he can provide a safe environment for the kids given the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the family dynamics. The sister was supposed to take the kids but had to leave for a medical emergency. The brother might be in a bind, but the author's refusal isn't unreasonable given the constraints. The brother's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling for an hour and calling the author names. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when the request is short notice and they know his preferences.\n\nBut maybe the author could have offered alternatives? Like suggesting a different caregiver or helping in another way. However, the situation is that the sister is unavailable, and they needed someone. The author's main argument is that he can't do it due to personal and logistical reasons, which seems valid. \n\nThe key points are short notice, the author's known dislike of kids, and the practical impossibility of meeting their request. The brother's anger and public shaming might be the real issue here. The author isn't wrong for saying no, especially when they were expecting him to make a significant sacrifice without prior notice.\n"
