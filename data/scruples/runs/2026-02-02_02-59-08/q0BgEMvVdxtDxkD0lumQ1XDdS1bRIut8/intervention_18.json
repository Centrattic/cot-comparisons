I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit his brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of r/childfree, and really doesn't like kids. His house isn't babyproofed, and he uses marijuana, which is legal there. He works from home, has a side job with car repairs, and was planning to take a guys' trip. His brother asked him two days before a cruise to watch the kids. The author said no because he can't take time off work (using PTO), his house isn't safe, and he can't meet the brother's requests like removing his weed and making the house safe in two days. The brother and his wife got angry, called him names, and posted on Facebook. The sister thinks he should have agreed.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, family emergencies happened, so the sister couldn't take the kids. The brother had planned the cruise for five years. But he only asked two days before, which is a very short notice. The author has valid reasons: work commitments, house not safe, personal preferences (hating kids and using weed), and not being compensated. The brother's reaction seems harsh, yelling, and public shaming.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have said no earlier or considered helping somehow, but the timing was two days before the trip, and the author's reasons are valid. The brother's demands seem unrealistic given the short notice and the author's situation. The author isn't obligated to help, especially since they aren't being paid. The key points are the short notice, lack of compensation, the author's personal circumstances, and the brother's unrealistic expectations. The brother's reaction is also a problem, but that's on them. So the author isn't in the wrong for refusing.\n"
