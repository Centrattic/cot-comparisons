I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. The situation is that the brother and his wife asked for help two days before a planned cruise, and the author refused, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 23, a single guy who hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and his house isn't baby-proofed. He works from home and uses PTO for a guys' trip. The brother needed last-minute childcare because their sister had a family emergency. The author declined, and the brother's response was harsh, including calling him a drug addict and ranting on Facebook.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he has valid reasons: he doesn't like kids, his house isn't safe, he has work commitments, and the request came with little notice. The brother's cruise has been planned for five years, but the timing is inconvenient. The author isn't being paid, so using PTO isn't feasible. The brother's response seems harsh, especially considering the short notice and the author's legitimate constraints.\n\nOn the other hand, family obligations can sometimes require flexibility. The brother might feel entitled to help, especially for a significant event. However, the author isn't obligated to help if it's not feasible. The key is whether the refusal is reasonable. The author isn't the only available option; maybe there were other options they didn't consider. But given the situation, the author's reasons seem valid. The brother's reaction is also problematic, making the author seem less at fault.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
