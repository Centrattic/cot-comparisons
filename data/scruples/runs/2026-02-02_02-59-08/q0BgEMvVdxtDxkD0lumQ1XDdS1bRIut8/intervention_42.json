I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brothers' kids. The person is 23, part of r/childfree, hates children, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it often. Their job allows some marijuana use, and they work from home. The brother wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary but their sister couldn't because her husband's family had an emergency. Two days before the trip, they ask the author to babysit. He refuses because he can't take time off work (using PTO he had saved for a trip), his house isn't baby-safe, and he can't move his work setup. The brother and wife get angry, call him names, and he's being judged as an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for refusal. He says he hates kids, his house isn't safe, he's got work commitments, and the request came too late. The family might expect him to help, especially as a younger sibling. But he's a single man without kids, perhaps with other responsibilities. Does he have a duty to help family in this situation?\n\nIn many cultures, especially close-knit families, there's an expectation to support siblings when possible. However, the author has valid reasons: his house isn't safe, he's using marijuana, and the timing with work is an issue. He's also not being compensated, which might be a factor. The brother and wife's reaction is harsh, yelling for an hour and public shaming on Facebook, which is unkind. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the refusal is based on legitimate reasons and the family's reaction is disproportionate, then the author might not be the asshole. But if the author is being selfish without considering family obligations, maybe he is. However, the author's stance is that he can't make the sacrifices needed (time, work, changing his living environment), and those are his personal time and space. The sister is also involved, but she's unavailable. The cruise is significant, but the author's ability to cancel his own plans and rearrange his work to accommodate might be a stretch. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's refusal seems reasonable given the circumstances. The family's expectations might be unrealistic, especially with the short notice and the personal impact on the author. The labeling as a \"drug addict\" and the public shaming are clearly over the top. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
