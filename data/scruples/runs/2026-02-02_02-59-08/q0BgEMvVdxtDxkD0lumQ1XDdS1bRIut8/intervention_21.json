I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brothers' kids. The situation is that the author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, and has a home where marijuana is present. The brother asked last minute (two days before a cruise) to watch the kids, and the author said no because they can't rearrange their work, the house isn't safe, and they don't want to give up their PTO for a guys' trip. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author names, and the author's sister is pressuring them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of family responsibilities. In many families, helping out with childcare is common, especially for immediate family. However, the author has made it clear they hate kids and that their lifestyle (marijuana use, not baby-proofed home) isn't suitable. The request came with very short notice, and the author has valid reasons: work commitments, needing PTO, and the impracticality of making their house safe. \n\nBut maybe the expectation is that family comes first. If the brother had planned this trip for five years, maybe the author is expected to make sacrifices. However, the timing was terrible. Two days' notice is unreasonable for someone to prepare. Also, the author isn't being paid, which adds to the burden. The brother's reaction (yelling, calling names, ranting on Facebook) seems extreme, which might indicate they overstepped.\n\nThe author's reasons are legitimate. They have a right to their time and space. The fact that the author has communicated their dislike for children and the unsuitability of their home beforehand is important. It's not like they suddenly decided to say no without prior context. The brother's demand to get rid of the marijuana and make the house safe in two days is unrealistic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's refusal might be seen as selfish, especially if the sister is in a situation where she can't help due to her own emergency. But the author's reasons (work, personal preferences, safety) are valid. Also, the brother's approach was poor\u2014last-minute request without considering the author's circumstances. The author isn't the only one at fault here. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Their refusal is based on legitimate reasons and prior communication. The brother's handling of the situation is where the fault lies more. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
