I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this scenario is in the wrong for not babysitting his brother's kids. The situation is presented as an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post. The author is a 23-year-old single man who hates children and uses marijuana. His brother planned a cruise for their anniversary and wanted him to babysit two days before the trip. The author refused because his house isn't babyproofed, he's working from home, has a side business with repair appointments, and was saving PTO for a guys' trip. The brother and his wife got angry, called him names, and they posted about it on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the author's reasons for declining and whether those reasons are valid. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Personal Preferences and Capabilities**: The author explicitly states he hates children and his family knows this. He's also using marijuana, which the brother and wife are against allowing around their kids. This is a legitimate reason because the parents want a safe environment for their children. The author's house isn't babyproofed, which is a valid concern. So, the refusal is based on actual inability to provide a safe environment, not just dislike of kids.\n\n2. **Timing and Notice**: The brother asked two days before the trip. The author has a side job with scheduled appointments and can't rearrange his work. It's a short notice, and expecting someone to adjust their schedule for a week is a big ask, especially without prior planning. The parents might have been unprepared, which is on them, not the author.\n\n3. **Financial and Time Sacrifices**: The author mentions using PTO days he was saving for a trip. The parents' cruise cost is $900, but the author's sacrifice is his time and plans. It's his right to prioritize his own commitments, especially when not being paid.\n\n4. **Reactions of the Parents**: The parents yelled at him, called him derogatory names, and took to Facebook. Their overreaction is unkind. The author isn't obligated to accommodate their last-minute request, especially when it's not feasible.\n\n5. **Alternatives and Communication**: The parents had a backup plan with their sister, but that fell through due to a family emergency. They might have had other options instead of turning to the author. The author did communicate his inability to help, which is respectful.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's refusal is based on valid reasons: personal preferences, safety issues, work commitments, and lack of notice. The parents' expectations were unreasonable given the circumstances. The author isn't being selfish; he's being honest about his limitations. The parents' response was inappropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
