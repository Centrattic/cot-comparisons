He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who broke up with his girlfriend after she ended the relationship because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. The friend is acting out, threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and threatening to go to her place. The author, after the friend's hospitalization, tells him he's being creepy and pathetic and needs to stop, which leads to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's behavior. He's threatening self-harm and harassment post-breakup, which is concerning. The author is trying to intervene, perhaps to protect the ex-girlfriend and help their friend. The key points are whether the author crossed a line in their approach.\n\nThe author's friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer. The author's words were harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), but the intent was to stop harmful behavior. In such situations, friends often feel they need to step in when someone is acting irrationally, especially when there's potential harm. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to prevent further harassment and potential harm to both the friend and ex-girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the method of confrontation is important. The author did it in a direct and negative way, which the friend took as an attack, leading to being kicked out. But given the context of the friend's mental health crisis and the severity of the actions (threats of self-harm, stalking), the author's intervention was likely justified. The primary responsibility here is to prevent harm, and the author's message, though delivered harshly, aimed at that.\n\nSo, considering the situation's gravity and the author's intent to stop harmful behavior, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
