He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was really acting out, threatening suicide, harassing the ex, and the author finally snapped and told him off. The friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's friend is clearly in a bad state, showing signs of obsession and self-harm threats. The author's intervention was to call him out on being creepy and pathetic. The friend reacted angrily and kicked them out. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior versus the author's response. The friend's actions are definitely problematic: threatening self-harm, stalking, and not respecting the ex's decision. The author's friends agree that the content of the message is valid but the delivery might have been harsh. The author is wondering if their approach was wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The friend's actions are clearly inappropriate, but the author's method of confronting them might have been too direct. The friends said the message is right but could have been said nicer. So, the author isn't wrong for the content of what they said, but maybe the tone or timing was off. However, the core issue is that the friend is acting in a way that's harmful and needs to be addressed. \n\nThe author's intent was to help by stopping the harmful behavior. Even if the delivery was harsh, the message was necessary. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking the author out) might be a sign of defensiveness, which is common in such situations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for delivering a tough message, even if it was said in a less-than-ideal way. The main issue was the friend's behavior, and the author was trying to help. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
