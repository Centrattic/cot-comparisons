He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, leading to the breakup. Post-breakup, the friend is acting out by threatening self-harm, contacting the ex constantly, and considering showing up unannounced.\n\nThe author, after spending time with the friend, snaps and calls them out on this behavior. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The friends agree with the author but think they could've been nicer. The user believes the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The friend is clearly in emotional distress, engaging in behaviors that are harmful to himself and potentially harassing the ex. The author's intervention, while harsh, is pointing out the need to stop such actions, which might be necessary to prevent further harm. However, the way they delivered the message\u2014calling the friend \"creepy and pathetic\"\u2014could have been more compassionate. \n\nBut the key points here are the friend's actions: threatening self-harm, persistent contact despite the breakup, and plans to confront the ex in person. These are red flags for potential harm and obsessive behavior. The author's friends agree that the behavior needs to stop, even if the approach could be softer. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help their friend recognize the unhealthy behavior. However, the tone might have been counterproductive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to be a good friend by addressing the issue. The friend's actions are problematic, so the author's message, though blunt, might be justified. But did the author have a right to be so direct? Maybe they could have used \"I\" statements or approached it with more empathy. But in urgent situations where someone is acting out, sometimes directness is necessary, even if it's not the nicest way. \n\nI think the author's intent was to help, which is good, but the method could have been improved. However, considering the severity of the friend's actions (self-harm threats, stalking-like behavior), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's behavior is the main issue here. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but they could have handled it better.\n"
