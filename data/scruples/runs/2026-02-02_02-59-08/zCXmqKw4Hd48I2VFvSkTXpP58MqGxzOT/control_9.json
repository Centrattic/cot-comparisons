He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend \"creepy and pathetic\" is in the wrong. The friend was in a relationship that ended, and he's acting out by threatening self-harm, incessantly contacting the ex, and wanting to confront her. The author stepped in to tell him to stop, which led to being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's actions. He's showing signs of stalking or obsessive behavior post-breakup. He was in the hospital due to self-harm threats, which is serious. The ex wants space, so continuing contact is definitely not okay. The author's friends agree with them, so maybe their message was necessary.\n\nBut the way the author delivered the message was harsh. They used words like \"creepy and pathetic,\" which might have been hurtful. The friend was already emotionally fragile, so a more compassionate approach might have been better. However, the intent was good\u2014to protect the ex and help the friend. \n\nThe key points are: the friend's actions are harmful, the author is trying to stop them, but the method could have been more empathetic. The question is whether the harsh words make the author at fault. Since the content of the message is valid (he needs to stop), but the delivery could have been improved, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but with a caveat about the approach. However, the user wants a strict A or B. The situation is more about the friend's behavior being wrong than the author's words, so the answer is B.\n"
