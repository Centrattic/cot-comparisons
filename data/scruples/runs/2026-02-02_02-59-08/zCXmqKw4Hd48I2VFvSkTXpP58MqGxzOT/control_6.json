He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who broke up with his girlfriend after she ended the relationship because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014calling 911, threatening self-harm, constantly contacting the ex, and wanting to confront her in person. The author, frustrated by this, told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a conflict and the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The friend's behavior sounds like it's escalating, with self-harm threats and stalking-like actions (calling repeatedly, wanting to approach the ex in person). The author tried to intervene, which is a responsible action. But they might have used harsh language. The friends agree with the message but think it could have been delivered more nicely. So the question is whether the author overstepped by using those words.\n\nHarsh words can be seen as unkind, especially when someone is in emotional distress. However, the friend's actions are problematic and potentially dangerous. The author's intention was to get through to him, which is understandable. The key is whether the author had the right to confront them directly. Since the friend was a danger to himself and possibly others, the author's intervention, even if abrupt, might be necessary. But the method could have been more constructive. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking them out) is a consequence of the confrontation style, not the content. So the author isn't in the wrong for the message, just maybe the delivery. The answer should be B (No), because the friend's behavior needed addressing, and while the wording was harsh, the intent was to help, which is valid.\n"
