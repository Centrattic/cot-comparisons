He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author, after trying to support him, finally snaps and tells him to stop being creepy and pathetic. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. Friends agree with the message but maybe the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy and potentially stalking-like. The author is trying to help by pointing out the friend's problematic actions. While the method might have been harsh, the intention seems to be good. The key here is whether the author overstepped. They didn't attack the friend's character beyond the specific behavior. The friend's actions were harmful, so calling out the behavior isn't wrong. The author might have handled it better, but they aren't in the wrong for speaking up. So the answer is B.\n"
