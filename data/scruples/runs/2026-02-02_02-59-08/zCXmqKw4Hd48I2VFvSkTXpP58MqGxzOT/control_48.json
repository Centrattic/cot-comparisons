He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic is in the wrong. The friend was going through a breakup and was acting out by threatening self-harm and harassing the ex. The author intervened, which led to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation's key points. The friend was in a serious emotional state, had been hospitalized, and was engaging in stalking and harassment behaviors. The author tried to stop this by calling out the behavior directly. The friends agree with the author's stance but think a nicer approach could have been taken. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's intent was to help the friend avoid further harm and respect the ex's wishes. The friend's actions were clearly problematic, so the author's concern is valid. However, the method of confrontation might have been harsh. The author says they \"lost it\" and told the friend he was creepy and pathetic. While the content of the message was correct, the tone and timing might have been poor, leading to the friend kicking them out. \n\nBut considering the context\u2014friends agreeing with the author and the friend's dangerous behavior\u2014the author's actions were in line with trying to help. The main issue here is that the friend's behavior was unacceptable, and the author was trying to prevent further harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's harmful actions, even if the delivery could have been better. The answer would be B (No).\n"
