He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's being really obsessive after a breakup. The writer told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex repeatedly, and considering showing up at her place. These behaviors are definitely concerning and possibly unhealthy or even stalking-like.\n\nThe writer intervened by telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The writer's friends agree with the message but think it could have been delivered nicer. The key here is whether the writer's message was justified given the situation.\n\nThe writer's intent was to stop harmful behavior. Even though the delivery might have been harsh, the content of the message\u2014that the friend needs to stop contacting the ex and realize she doesn't want to get back together\u2014is valid. The friend's actions are problematic, and the writer was trying to prevent further issues. \n\nHowever, the method of communication matters. Telling someone they're \"pathetic\" can come off as personal and hurtful, which might not be constructive. A more supportive approach might have been better, but the core message was right. The friend needed to hear that his behavior was inappropriate and dangerous.\n\nSo, considering the context, the writer wasn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's harmful behavior. The friend's actions required intervention, and while the tone could have been better, the substance of the message was correct. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
