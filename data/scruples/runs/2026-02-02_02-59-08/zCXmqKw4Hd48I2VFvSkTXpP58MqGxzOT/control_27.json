He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast, and now he's threatening self-harm and trying to get the girl back. The author confronts him, says he's being creepy, and gets kicked out. Friends think the author was right but could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior post-breakup is clearly problematic: threatening self-harm, stalking, and harassment. The author is trying to help him by pointing out the creepy behavior, which is necessary for his well-being and the ex's safety. But the author's approach might have been harsh, leading to conflict. However, the core issue is the friend's actions, not the author's methods. The author's intention was to stop harmful behavior, which is justified. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking them out) doesn't negate the author's right to speak up. While there's room for a more empathetic approach, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing the issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
