He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author confronted him, telling him to stop, and got kicked out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, and planning to confront her. The author's intervention was to tell him he's being creepy and to stop. The key points here are the severity of the friend's behavior and the author's intent to help.\n\nThe author didn't confront the friend in a public or aggressive way but did it during their turn supporting him. The friend was already in a fragile state, so the author's approach might have been harsh, but the content of the message was necessary. The friends agree with the author, which suggests the message was justified. The author's intent was to prevent further harmful behavior, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more empathetic in their delivery. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the friend's actions were abusive and the author was trying to help, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The fact that the friends agree supports this. The friend's reaction (kicking out) is his issue, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
