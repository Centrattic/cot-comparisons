He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend had a breakup and is acting in a way that seems obsessive and potentially dangerous. The friend was with the girl for eight months and was super intense, talking about marriage early on. Now, after the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling her constantly, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author confronts him, calls him creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight and him getting kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic. Pursuing someone after a breakup to the point of threatening harm on himself and stalking the ex is not okay. The author's friends agree that the behavior needs to stop, so there's some consensus there. The author intervened when they saw their friend's actions as harmful. But was the way they did it appropriate?\n\nThe author's friends said they could have done it more nicely, so maybe the approach was harsh. However, the friend's actions are dangerous. The author is trying to help their friend realize he's being obsessive and that the ex wants nothing to do with him. The confrontation happened after multiple attempts to get the friend to stop. The author's intention was to stop the unhealthy behavior, even if the method was direct.\n\nOn one hand, calling someone \"creepy and pathetic\" might be harsh, but given the context, it's a strong statement that could wake someone up to their problematic behavior. The key here is that the author's actions were meant to prevent further harm, both to the ex and to the friend's own well-being. The author didn't just ignore it; they tried to step in when the friend was in crisis. \n\nBut was there a better way to approach it? The friends said they agree with the message but the delivery could have been softer. However, sometimes when someone is in denial or in a crisis, a direct approach might be necessary. The author's actions might be seen as necessary tough love, even if it was harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one acting in a harmful way. They're the one trying to correct their friend's behavior. So while the method could have been improved, the core message was valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
