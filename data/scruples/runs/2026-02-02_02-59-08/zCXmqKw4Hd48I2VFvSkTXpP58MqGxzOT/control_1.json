He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he pushed for marriage, then got dumped for moving too fast. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex non-stop, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after multiple attempts to reason with him, finally snaps and calls him out, leading to their friend kicking them out. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup, which seems obsessive and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to help by stopping the friend's harmful actions. The friend's actions are not just emotional; they involve threats (self-harm) and stalking, which are serious. The author's intervention is direct but perhaps not the most tactful, but the intent is to protect the ex and help the friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic, and the author is trying to prevent further harm. However, the method of confrontation might have been harsh. But the main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's. Even if the delivery could be improved, the message is valid. So the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the behavior. They might have a point in being direct given the urgency of the situation. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
