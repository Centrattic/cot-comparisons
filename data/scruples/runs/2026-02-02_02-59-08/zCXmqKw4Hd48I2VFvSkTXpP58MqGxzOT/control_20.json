He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's being obsessive and threatening after a breakup, and the author confronts him directly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, moving too fast according to the girlfriend. He has anxiety and then after the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling 911 because he's threatening suicide, then constantly contacting the ex, wanting to get her back, even considering showing up at her place. The author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out. Friends agreed with the author but said maybe a nicer approach was possible.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key factors here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Repeated threats of suicide, stalking behavior (calling, wanting to visit her), and the author trying to stop him. The author's message is that the ex doesn't want to get back together. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The friends agreed with the message but thought the delivery could have been better.\n\nIn such cases, friends have a responsibility to intervene when someone's actions are harmful. The author is trying to protect both the friend and the ex. The confrontation was direct, but given the severity of the friend's actions (potential stalking, self-harm threats), the author's message is valid. However, the method could be questioned\u2014maybe a more compassionate approach would have been better to avoid pushing the friend away. But the content of what was said is justified because the friend needed to hear that he's acting inappropriately.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for the message, even if the delivery could have been smoother. The answer should be B (No). The author isn't at fault for confronting the friend about harmful behavior.\n"
