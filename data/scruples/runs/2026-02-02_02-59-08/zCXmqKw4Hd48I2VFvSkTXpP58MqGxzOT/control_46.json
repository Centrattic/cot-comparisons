  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting unhealthily after a breakup, and the author confronts him.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship where he was moving too fast, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, he's exhibiting concerning behavior: threatening self-harm, constant calls to his ex, and even considering showing up uninvited at her place. The author, after trying to support him, finally tells him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The author's friends agree with them but think the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to confront their friend. On one hand, the author is trying to help their friend by pointing out harmful behavior. The friend's actions are indeed problematic and potentially dangerous (like stalking or harassment). The author's message seems to be to stop the behavior, which is the right thing. But the way it was said might have been harsh, leading to the friend's anger. However, the content of the message is valid. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing the real issue. The friend's actions are the problem here, not the author's honest feedback, even if the delivery could be improved. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
