He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting in a way that's concerning after a breakup. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months where he was pushing for marriage and moving too fast. The girl broke up with him because of that, and he's been struggling with his mental health, even threatening self-harm. The author tried to intervene by telling him he's being creepy and that the girl doesn't want to get back together. The friend got angry and kicked the author out.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's response was wrong. The friend's behavior\u2014constant calls, threats of self-harm, and stalking-like actions\u2014is clearly not appropriate. The author was trying to help him stop these harmful behaviors. Even though the author's friends said they could have been nicer, the key point is that the friend was in a bad mental state and needed to be stopped. \n\nThe author's actions were aimed at preventing further emotional distress to the ex-girlfriend and addressing the friend's mental health. While the approach might have been harsh, the intent was to help. Kicking the author out was the friend's reaction, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for the ex's boundaries. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
