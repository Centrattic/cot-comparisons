He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy and pathetic after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the story. The friend was with his girlfriend for eight months, and he was really pushy about marriage and moving fast. She broke up with him because he was too intense and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he started threatening self-harm, called the hospital, and kept trying to get her back, even considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, took turns helping him, but during the author's turn, they snapped and told him he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to being kicked out. Friends agree with the author's sentiment but think maybe the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking, harassment. The author intervened to tell him to stop, which is a good intention. However, the way they did it might have been harsh. The author called him \"creepy and pathetic,\" which could be seen as shaming. But considering the context, the friend was in a mental health crisis, and the author was trying to help. \n\nIs the author wrong for speaking up? Well, the friend needed to stop his behavior, and the author was part of a support system. The friends agree with the message, so the content was appropriate. The problem might be the delivery, but the core message was necessary. The author wasn't attacking the friend's mental health but the behavior. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, using harsh words like \"pathetic\" might be unkind, but in the context of stopping harmful actions, it could be justified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have been more empathetic. But given that the friend was being told by others and still not changing, the author's frustration is understandable. The key is whether the author crossed a line. Since the friends agree with the message, the author's intent was good. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action was necessary to protect the ex and the friend's well-being, even if the delivery could have been softer.\n"
