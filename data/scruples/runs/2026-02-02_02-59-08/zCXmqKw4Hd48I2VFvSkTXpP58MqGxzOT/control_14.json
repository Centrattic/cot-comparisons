He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup, and the writer confronts him.\n\nFirst, the friend was moving too fast in the relationship and was told by his ex to slow down. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, which is a serious issue. The writer steps in and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out. The friends agree with the writer but think they could have been nicer.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The writer's intent was to help their friend stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions (harassment, threats) are clearly problematic. The writer's approach might have been harsh, but the message was necessary. Calling someone \"pathetic\" could come off as unkind, but the friend's behavior was indeed concerning. The writer might have been justified in being blunt to get through to him, especially since they had to call 911 before. The key point is whether the confrontation was warranted. Since the friend was persisting in unhealthy actions, the writer's intervention was appropriate, even if the tone could be improved. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
