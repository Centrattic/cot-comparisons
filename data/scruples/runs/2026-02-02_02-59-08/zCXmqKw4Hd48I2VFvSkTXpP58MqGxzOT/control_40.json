He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup and the author confronts him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, moved too fast, which led to the breakup. After that, he's been threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and considering showing up at her place. The author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out. Friends think the author was right but could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the main points are: the friend's behavior is clearly concerning\u2014self-harm threats, stalking behavior, not respecting the ex's wishes. The author is trying to help by confronting him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nPossible angles: Is it the author's place to criticize like that? The friend was in a fragile mental state, maybe the harsh words weren't helpful. But on the other hand, the friend's actions are harmful and need to stop. The author's friends agree with the sentiment but think the approach could have been softer.\n\nLegal or ethical considerations: The ex has the right to not be harassed. The friend's actions might be stalking or harassment, which is illegal. The author is trying to prevent that. However, the method of confrontation\u2014calling him creepy and pathetic\u2014might have been too harsh, but the intent was good.\n\nIs the author wrong? The answer depends on whether the message is valid. Since the friend's behavior is inappropriate, the content of the message is correct. The delivery might have been harsh, but the author's intent was to help. So the author isn't in the wrong for the message's content, even if the delivery could be improved. Therefore, answer B (No).\n"
