He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's being obsessive after a breakup, and the author confronts him, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend then kicks them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm and stalking behavior. The author and friends took turns supporting him, but when the author finally snaps, the friend reacts aggressively.\n\nThe question is whether the author was right to confront him that way. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to help their friend by pointing out harmful behavior. On the other hand, the way they did it might have been harsh, especially when the friend is already in a vulnerable state.\n\nBut wait, the friend was threatening self-harm and making creepy calls. The author's friends agreed with the message, just thought the delivery could have been better. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to stop the harmful behavior, even if the approach was tough. However, in a moment of emotional distress, direct confrontation could escalate things. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) might indicate he was overwhelmed, which could be part of his anxiety. \n\nStill, the core issue is whether the author was wrong. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking, and persistent harassment. The author is trying to intervene when others might not have the courage. Even if the words were harsh, the intent was to help. The friend's response doesn't negate the validity of the concern. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they were addressing harmful behavior, even if the method was confrontational. The alternative is A, if the author's words were unnecessarily harsh and contributed to the friend's distress. But given the context of imminent threats and harassment, the author's intervention seems justified. Friends often need to be direct to help each other. The friend's reaction is part of his emotional state, not necessarily the author's fault for speaking up.\n"
