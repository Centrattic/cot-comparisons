He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and dealing with anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening suicide, calling his ex constantly, and threatening to confront her. The author, after trying to support the friend, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop.\n\nThe friend reacts by kicking the author out. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think they could have worded it better.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's behavior, which is clearly problematic and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to stop their friend from doing something harmful, both to himself and possibly others. \n\nEven though the friend is upset and the author's delivery might have been harsh, the intent was to help. The friend's actions (threats, stalking behavior) are not acceptable, so the author is pointing out the reality of the situation. \n\nHowever, the way it was said could have been more compassionate. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's actions were meant to prevent further harm, which is a reasonable response. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to help a friend who was acting irrationally and dangerously.\n"
