He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The friend was emotionally unstable, had a mental health crisis leading to a hospital visit, and was making threats towards himself and his ex. The author intervened when they felt the friend's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions post-breakup are concerning. Calling the ex multiple times, threatening self-harm, and considering showing up uninvited are all red flags. The author's friends agree that the behavior needs to stop, so the author stepping in isn't unwarranted. The key here is whether the method used was appropriate.\n\nThe author told their friend directly that he was being creepy and pathetic. While the language might be harsh, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's response was to kick them out, but the friends think the message was necessary even if the delivery could have been kinder. The main issue is whether the friend's actions were harmful enough to justify the intervention, regardless of the tone.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, preventing someone from harassing an ex and engaging in self-harming behavior is important. The author's message, although blunt, was to protect the ex and their friend. The friend's mental health is a factor, but the author's role here is to help them see the harm in their actions. The friends support the author, indicating the message was needed.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's harmful behavior, even if the delivery could have been softer. The answer should be B.\n"
