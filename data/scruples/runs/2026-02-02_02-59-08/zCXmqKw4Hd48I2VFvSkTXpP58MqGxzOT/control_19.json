He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off. The friend then kicked the author out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and considering showing up uninvited. The author confronts him, calls him creepy and pathetic, which leads to a fallout.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was right to confront him in that way. The author's friends agreed with the message but thought the delivery could have been nicer. But the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe friend's actions are definitely problematic. Harassment, stalking, and threats of self-harm are serious. The author was trying to help, even if the tone was harsh. However, the author's approach might have been confrontational. But given the context, the friend needed to stop his behavior, and the author's message, while harsh, was necessary.\n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014getting angry and kicking the author out\u2014might be his own issue, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The key is whether the author overstepped. The friends agreed with the message, just the delivery. So, the content of the message was appropriate, even if the tone wasn't perfect.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the action was justified. Here, the author was trying to prevent a friend from acting in a harmful and inappropriate way. Even if the delivery was rough, the intent was to help. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
