He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship. He was pushing for marriage, but she broke up because he was moving too fast and needs to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling her and others threatening self-harm, constant calls to get her back, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after trying to support him, finally snaps and tells him he's creepy and pathetic. The friend kicks them out. The author's friends agree with the message but think it could have been said nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup, which is clearly stalking or harassing. The author intervened to stop that behavior, which is understandable. The question is whether the author was wrong to say those words.\n\nThe friend's actions are inappropriate and potentially dangerous. The author's friends agree that the behavior needs to stop. Even if the author could have been nicer, the message itself was valid. The friend was acting in a way that's not acceptable, and the author was trying to help. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
