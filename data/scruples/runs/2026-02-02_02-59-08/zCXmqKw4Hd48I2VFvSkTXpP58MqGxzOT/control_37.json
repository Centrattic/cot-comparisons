He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended, and he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The author stepped in, told him to stop, and he got angry and kicked them out.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong. The key factors here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's not just sad; he's making threats of self-harm and harassment. The author intervened to stop this, which seems like a responsible action. Friends often need to step in when someone's behavior becomes harmful. \n\nBut maybe the way they did it could have been better. The friends agreed with the message but thought the delivery was harsh. However, the core message\u2014that he's being creepy and needs to stop\u2014is valid. The ex has clearly said no, so any attempt to pursue her is inappropriate. \n\nThe author's actions were aimed at protecting both their friend and the ex. Even if the delivery was rough, the intent was good. So, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). They're trying to help someone in a harmful state.\n"
