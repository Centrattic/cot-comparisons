He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend had a breakup and was acting really dramatically. The friend was threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place, which sounds really stalker-like. The author, after being around the friend and hearing the same stuff over and over, finally had enough and told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked the author out. The author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is definitely concerning. Threatening self-harm is a red flag and requires immediate attention. The friend is also harassing the ex, which is not okay. The author and friends are trying to support him, but maybe the friend isn't listening. The author's outburst was after multiple instances of the friend talking about getting her back, which could escalate into something more dangerous.\n\nNow, the author's approach: they told their friend directly that he was being creepy and pathetic. That's pretty harsh language, even if the message is correct. The friends agreed that the author's message was right but could have been said more nicely. So the question is, does the harsh delivery make the author at fault?\n\nIn terms of intent, the author was trying to stop a friend from behaving in a way that's harmful and potentially illegal (harassment, stalking). The method was confrontational, but was it wrong to say that? The friend was already in a fragile mental state, so maybe a more compassionate approach would have been better. However, sometimes people need a direct wake-up call, especially when they're in denial.\n\nAlso, the author's friends took turns supporting the friend, which shows they were trying to help. The author's intervention was after multiple attempts to calm the friend down. The line between being supportive and being confrontational is thin here.\n\nLegal aspects: If the friend's actions could be considered stalking or harassment, then the author's warning might be justified. But did the author have the right to label their friend as \"creepy and pathetic\"? That's subjective. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, like suggesting professional help or setting boundaries without using those terms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the right in terms of the content of the message (the friend needs to stop), but the delivery could have been better. However, given the urgency of the situation (potential self-harm and harassment), the author's direct approach might be understandable. The friends agreed with the message, so maybe the author isn't at fault. But since they could have used a kinder tone, there's some nuance here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since their intent was to help and prevent harm, and the friends agree, probably the answer is B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would say A because of the harshness. It's a bit tricky, but leaning towards B.\n"
