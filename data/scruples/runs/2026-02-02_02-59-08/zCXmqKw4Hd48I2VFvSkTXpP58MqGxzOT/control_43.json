He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The friend was in a relationship for eight months and was moving too fast, leading to a breakup. The friend then became overwhelmed with anxiety, threatened self-harm, got hospitalized, and kept trying to contact the ex. The author confronted him directly, leading to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy and potentially dangerous. Harassing an ex after a breakup, especially after being told not to contact them, is problematic. The author's friends agree with the assessment, though they suggest a nicer approach.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author was wrong to confront their friend. The friend's actions were harmful and needed to stop. The author's intention was to help, even if the delivery was harsh. The alternative would be to let the friend continue harmful behavior, which could lead to more serious consequences. \n\nThe author did take action when others were also involved in supporting the friend. They had to call 911 before, showing the situation was already dire. Confronting the friend directly, even if not perfectly worded, is a responsible action to prevent further harm. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking the author out) doesn't negate the validity of the author's concern.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to help someone in a crisis and stop harmful behavior. Even if the approach could have been softer, the intent was right. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
