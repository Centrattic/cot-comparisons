He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, and is now acting out by threatening suicide, harassing the ex, and wanting to confront her. The user confronted him, told him he's being creepy, and got kicked out. Their friends agreed with them but said they could've been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic: after a breakup, he's threatening self-harm, constantly calling the ex, and possibly stalking her. The user and their friends are trying to intervene. The user's approach was direct and critical, which might have been harsh, but the intent was to help.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the friend's actions versus the user's response. While the user's words might not have been the most tactful, the underlying issue is serious. The friend needs to stop his behavior, and the user's message, though blunt, was necessary. Friends often need to be honest, even if it's not gentle, when someone is in a harmful situation. Plus, the user's friends agree that the behavior should stop, which supports the user's stance. So even if the delivery could have been better, the user isn't in the wrong for trying to help. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the user's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
