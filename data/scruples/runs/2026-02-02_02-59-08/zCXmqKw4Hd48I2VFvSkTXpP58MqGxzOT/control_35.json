He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after trying to support him, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm is serious and requires intervention. The author and others called 911, which shows they took his threats seriously. Then, when trying to help, the author confronts him about his actions, which are indeed harmful and not acceptable. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the author's reaction appropriate given the circumstances? The friend was in a crisis, but his actions were inappropriate. The author's message was direct but necessary. The friends agree with the author's sentiment, even if they thought a nicer approach might have been better. \n\nHowever, the author's tone might have been harsh. Using words like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic\" could be seen as judgmental, which might not be the best approach when someone is already in emotional distress. But the content of the message\u2014stopping the harmful behavior\u2014is valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was trying to prevent further harm to both the friend and the ex-girlfriend. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author's confrontation, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was aimed at addressing a dangerous situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's inappropriate behavior, even if the delivery could have been softer. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's intervention.\n"
