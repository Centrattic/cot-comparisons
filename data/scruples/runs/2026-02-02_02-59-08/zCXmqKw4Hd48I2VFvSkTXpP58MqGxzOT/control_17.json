He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, moving too fast. The girl broke up because he's not ready, he has anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling her non-stop, and wanting to confront her. The author, after trying to support him, had enough and told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight and being kicked out. Friends agree with the author but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014harassment, threats, not respecting the breakup. The author was trying to help by setting a boundary, even if the method was harsh. The key points are that the friend was in the wrong, and the author intervened to stop harmful behavior. While the approach could have been kinder, the intent was good, and the core message was valid. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up against creepy behavior, even if the delivery was rough. So, answer B (No).\n"
