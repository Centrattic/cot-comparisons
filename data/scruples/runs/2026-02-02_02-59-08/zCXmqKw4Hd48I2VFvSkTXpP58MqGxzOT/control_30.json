He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend was in an eight-month relationship, made grand promises about the future, but the girl broke up because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after trying to support their friend, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend kicks them out. The author's friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo the question is, was the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider a few things. The author's friend is engaging in stalking-like behavior, which is definitely wrong. The ex has clearly stated she doesn't want to get back together. The friend's actions are not only creepy but also potentially dangerous, with threats of self-harm and harassment. The author steps in to call out this behavior, even if it wasn't the nicest way. \n\nIn these situations, it's important to prevent harm to both the ex and the friend. The author's friends agree with them, which suggests that their message was necessary. However, the method was harsh. But the key point is whether the author was wrong in confronting the behavior, regardless of the tone. Since the behavior was harmful and the author was trying to help, even if the approach could have been better, the intention was good. \n\nI think the answer is B (no), because the author was right to point out the problematic behavior, even if they could have been more tactful. The main issue is that the friend needs to stop being creepy and threatening. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing it.\n"
