He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend going through a breakup and acting in a way that's concerning, like threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author confronts the friend, telling him he's being creepy and pathetic, which leads to the friend kicking them out. The friends agree with the author but think maybe the approach could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The friend's behavior post-breakup is clearly problematic\u2014he's making threats, can't accept the ending, and is considering confronting the ex. The author's outburst is in response to this. The question is whether the author is at fault for speaking up.\n\nThe author's friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been more considerate. So, while the approach might have been harsh, the intent was to help. The author is highlighting harmful behavior that others (including the ex) have already called out. The friend's actions are not just about the author's opinion but have led to hospitalization and 911 calls. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for addressing the friend's harmful actions. The friend was being advised by others too, but the author's direct confrontation might have been the last straw. However, the author could have been more empathetic given the friend's mental state. But since the behavior is objectively concerning, the author's actions are justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
