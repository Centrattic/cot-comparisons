He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup, and the author confronted him about it.\n\nFirst, the friend was moving too fast in the relationship, leading to the breakup. His reaction was extreme: threatening suicide, calling the ex, and showing intent to stalk her. The author and friends tried to support him, but when the author finally snapped after multiple incidents, he told his friend he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked him out. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to confront him. On one hand, the friend's behavior is clearly inappropriate and potentially dangerous. The author was trying to help by pointing out the unacceptable actions. The friend's reaction was extreme, but the author's intent was to stop harmful behavior. However, the way it was said might have been harsh, but the content itself is valid.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for calling out the behavior. Even if the delivery could have been smoother, the message was necessary. The friend's actions needed to be addressed, and the author was acting in what he believed was the right thing, albeit maybe with some emotional frustration. The key here is that the author's words were a response to something that needed to be addressed, even if the method wasn't perfect. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
