He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe friend was in an eight-month relationship where he was pushing for commitment, calling the girl \"the one.\" Then she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend had a mental breakdown, ended up in the hospital, and is now constantly contacting the ex, threatening self-harm, and wanting to confront her. The author told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight where the friend kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but think it could have been handled nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are emotional distress and stalking behavior. The friend is engaging in actions that are clearly harassment\u2014constant calls, threats of self-harm, wanting to show up at her place. The author is trying to stop him from continuing this, which is necessary for the ex's safety and his own well-being. The author's message was harsh but the content was valid. The friend's behavior is problematic, and the author is trying to help. While the delivery could have been softer, the intent was good. The author isn't wrong for pointing out the creepy behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
