He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, was moving too fast, got dumped, and now is acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and considering showing up at her place. The author confronted the friend, told him he's being creepy, and the friend kicked them out. Friends say the author could have been nicer but agree with the message.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014threatening self-harm is a serious issue, and stalking or harassment is not okay. The author was trying to help by pointing out the creepy behavior. Even though the friend was upset, the author's intent was to stop harmful actions. However, the way the author delivered the message might have been harsh, but the friends agree with the message, just the delivery could have been better. The key points are that the ex has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, and the friend isn't respecting her boundaries. The author is right to call out the behavior, even if the delivery was abrupt. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
