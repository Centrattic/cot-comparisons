He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is \"in the wrong\" for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nThe friend (22 years old) was in an 8-month relationship where he pushed things too fast. The breakup happened because the girl wanted him to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling constantly, and considering showing up uninvited. The writer of the post intervened by telling their friend he's being creepy and to stop. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The writer's friends agree with the message but think it could have been said nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014stalking or harassment tendencies, not respecting the ex's wishes, possible threats. The writer was trying to help by setting a boundary. Even though the message might have been harsh, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. The question is whether the writer is at fault for speaking up.\n\nIn such cases, friends often need to step in when someone's actions are harmful. While the delivery could have been softer, the core message was valid. The writer didn't attack the person directly but pointed out the behavior. So, is the writer in the wrong? Probably not, because they were trying to help a friend who's acting out. The friend's reaction was extreme, but the writer had a right to express concern. So the answer is B.\n"
