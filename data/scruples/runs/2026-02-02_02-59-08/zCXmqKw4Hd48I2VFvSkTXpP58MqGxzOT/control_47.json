He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast. The ex-girlfriend clearly didn't want to get back together. After the breakup, he started threatening self-harm and was taken to the hospital. He keeps calling the ex and wants to confront her in person. The author, after trying to support him, finally told him to stop, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out.\n\nNow, considering the situation: the friend is acting in a way that's potentially dangerous (threats of self-harm, stalking behavior by calling and planning to confront the ex). The author's friends agree with them, though they thought a nicer approach might work better. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to help their friend by pointing out harmful behavior. The friend was already in crisis mode, so maybe the author's tone was harsh, but the message was valid. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed a line. They didn't physically harm anyone, just spoke up when necessary. The friend kicked them out, but that's the friend's reaction, not necessarily the author's fault. The author's intent was to stop their friend from acting in a dangerous and inappropriate way. So, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
