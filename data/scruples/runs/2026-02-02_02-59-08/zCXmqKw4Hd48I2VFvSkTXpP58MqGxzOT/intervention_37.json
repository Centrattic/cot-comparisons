He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend broke up with his girlfriend after eight months, and now he's acting out by threatening suicide, calling her repeatedly, and considering confronting her in person. The author, who's 22, steps in and tells their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout where the friend kicks them out.\n\nThe author is now wondering if they were wrong to confront their friend. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nHmm. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014he's showing signs of stalking, possible harassment, and threatening self-harm. The author is trying to stop this by being direct and telling their friend to stop. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was the author's approach inappropriate despite the valid concern? The author's intention was to help their friend avoid further harm to himself and the ex. But they used harsh language (\"creepy and pathetic\"), which might have been too direct, leading to anger and the friend kicking them out.\n\nBut considering the context, the author's actions might be justified. The friend's behavior is concerning and needs to be addressed. The author did step in when others might have ignored it. However, the method could have been more constructive. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author is trying to intervene, even if the delivery was harsh.\n\nIn situations where someone's actions are harmful, even if the approach isn't perfect, the intent to help is commendable. The friends agree with the message, even if they think the delivery could have been better. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the core issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's intervention, even if the way it was delivered could have been softer.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should have been more supportive instead of using harsh words. However, given the severity of the friend's actions (threatening self-harm, stalking), the author's intervention might be necessary. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were addressing a serious issue, even if the method could have been better.\n"
