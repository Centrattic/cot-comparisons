  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a friend he is being creepy and pathetic following a breakup?\nMy friend was with this girl for about eight months. He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend had a breakup and was acting out by threatening self-harm and contacting the ex excessively. The writer intervened, told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, and got kicked out. The question is whether the writer was wrong to do that.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friend was in a crisis situation\u2014threatening self-harm, which led to a hospital visit. The ex wanted space, and the friend wasn't respecting that. The writer's friends agree with the sentiment but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nIs the writer wrong? The key points are: the writer was trying to help a friend who was in distress and acting out harmful behaviors. The friend's actions were indeed inappropriate, so pointing that out was necessary. Even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was to help. The writer didn't encourage the harmful behavior, so they're not at fault. The answer should be B (No).\n"
