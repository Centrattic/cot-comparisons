He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepily after a breakup, and the author confronts him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend was with a girl for eight months, moving too fast, leading to the breakup. After that, the friend is threatening suicide, calling the ex constantly, and wanting to visit her. The author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight where the friend kicks them out. The friends agree with the author but think it could have been done nicer.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014stalking or harassing the ex could be dangerous. The author is trying to prevent that. The author's message is that the friend needs to stop, which is valid. However, the delivery might have been harsh. The friend was already in a fragile state, so maybe a more compassionate approach could have been better. But the core message was right. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the harmful behavior, even if they could have softened the delivery. The alternative is letting the friend continue harmful actions, which isn't okay. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
