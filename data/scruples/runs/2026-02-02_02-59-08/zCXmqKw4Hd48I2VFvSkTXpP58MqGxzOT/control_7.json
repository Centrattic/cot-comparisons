He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy after a breakup. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months and was really pushing for a future with the girl, like marriage. Then she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014calling her threatening to harm himself, constantly asking her to come back, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after trying to support him, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a confrontation where the friend kicks them out. Friends agree with the author but think it could have been said nicer.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the key points. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking behavior (following her, showing up uninvited), and not respecting her decision to end the relationship. The author is trying to help by pointing out the friend's behavior is harmful and not acceptable. Even though the friend was upset, the author was trying to intervene in a situation that could escalate, especially with the threats of self-harm. The friends' agreement suggests that the author's message was valid, even if the delivery could have been softer.\n\nHowever, the author could have approached the conversation with more empathy. Yelling or being harsh might not be the best way, but the content of the message is correct. The friend needed to hear that his actions were wrong, regardless of the method. Since the author's intent was to help and stop dangerous behavior, they're probably not in the wrong. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's response.\n"
