He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, etc. The girl broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, planning to go to her place. The author, after trying to support the friend, finally snapped and told him he was creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nSo the main points are: the friend is exhibiting obsessive and potentially dangerous behavior post-breakup. The author is trying to intervene, albeit in a harsh way. The friends agree with the message but think a nicer approach might have been better.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's actions are problematic\u2014he's showing signs of stalking, harassment, and potential self-harm. The author is trying to stop this behavior. Even though the delivery was harsh, the content of the message is valid. The friends agree, suggesting that while the tone could be better, the intent is right. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been confrontational. Maybe a more supportive way to express the same concern would have been better. But the friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy, so the author isn't wrong for pointing that out. The key is that the author is trying to help, even if the method could be improved. \n\nSo the answer is B (no, the author isn't in the wrong). The core issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's intervention.\n"
