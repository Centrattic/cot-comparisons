He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their friend was in a relationship that ended, and the friend is acting really obsessively, even considering threatening himself and stalking the ex. The author told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's behavior. The friend is contacting the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, and considering showing up at her place uninvited. That's definitely concerning and potentially dangerous. The author's friends agree that the friend needs to stop, but they're questioning if the author was right to tell him off so directly.\n\nThe author's approach was to confront the friend in a moment of frustration, leading to the friend kicking them out. The friends suggest a nicer way could have been used, but they support the message. The key here is whether the author's method was wrong, given the friend's harmful behavior.\n\nSo, even if the delivery could have been softer, the message that the friend is acting inappropriately and needs to stop is valid. The author isn't wrong for pointing out the friend's problematic actions, especially when it's affecting others and the ex's safety. The friend's actions are the main issue here, not the author's intervention. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
