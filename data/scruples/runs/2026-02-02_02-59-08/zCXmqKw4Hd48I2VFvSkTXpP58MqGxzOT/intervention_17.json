He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The situation involves the friend being over the top in his pursuit of the ex, even after the breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, moving too fast, leading to a breakup. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, constant calls to the ex, considering showing up uninvited. The author confronted the friend, told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author's friends agree that the behavior should stop but think the approach could have been nicer. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to see if others agree.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author was justified. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014stalking, harassment, potential self-harm. The author is trying to help by stopping the harmful behavior. Confronting someone in a moment of emotional crisis might be rough, but the intent was to help. The friends agree with the message, even if the delivery could be smoother.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key is whether the confrontation was necessary and appropriate. The author's actions were to stop a friend from acting in a dangerous and inappropriate way. Even if the method was harsh, the message was valid. The friend's actions are unacceptable, so calling out the behavior isn't wrong. The author isn't in the wrong because they're preventing harm to the friend and the ex. The friends support the message, even if the delivery was harsh. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
