He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months and made big commitments early on, which the girl eventually broke up with because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend started threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, helped him after he was hospitalized. During this time, the author snapped and told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the facts: The friend's behavior post-breakup is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, harassment, and stalking-like actions. The author and friends were trying to support him, but when the friend kept fixating on getting the ex back, the author spoke up. The friends agreed with the author's sentiment, even if they thought the delivery could have been kinder. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions, which are concerning and potentially harmful. The author's message, while direct, was aimed at stopping harmful behavior. The question is whether the author overstepped. But considering the context, the author was trying to help a friend who was acting in a way that could cause more harm. The friends' support of the author's stance suggests they saw the situation similarly. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author was addressing serious issues in a necessary way, even if the approach could have been softer. The friend needed to hear that his actions were creepy and needed to stop.\n"
