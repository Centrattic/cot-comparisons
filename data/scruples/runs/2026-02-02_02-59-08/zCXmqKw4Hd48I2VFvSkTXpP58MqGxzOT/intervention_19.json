We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend had an eight-month relationship and was moving too fast, which led to the breakup. The friend is 22, which is young, so maybe he's not fully aware of social norms or boundaries. After the breakup, he starts threatening self-harm and contacting the ex excessively, even planning to go to her place. The author steps in, tells him he's being creepy and to stop, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe main points here: the friend is engaging in stalking or harassing behavior post-breakup, which is definitely not okay. The author is trying to intervene to stop this behavior, probably out of concern for both the friend and the ex. But the author's friend is in a vulnerable state, with anxiety and suicidal thoughts. \n\nNow, the author's approach was direct and maybe harsh. Instead of being supportive first, they called their friend creepy and pathetic. That could have been triggering or made the friend feel judged, especially when he's already in a fragile mental state. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think a nicer approach could have worked better. \n\nHowever, the behavior the friend is exhibiting is problematic. The author is right to point out that the ex doesn't want to get back together and that the friend needs to stop. But the method of delivery might not have been the best. The key is whether the author's intention was to help and they just used the wrong approach, versus if they were being cruel.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's behavior is the main issue. The author is trying to help, but maybe could have been more empathetic. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to stop harmful actions, but perhaps the way they communicated it could have been improved. However, given the urgency of the situation (the friend was threatening suicide and stalking), the author's intervention might be necessary, even if harsh. \n\nI think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're addressing a serious issue, even if their approach could have been better. The priority is stopping harmful behavior, and while the delivery could be more compassionate, the intent is good. The friend's actions are the real problem here.\n"
