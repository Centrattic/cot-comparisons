He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend going through a breakup and acting in a way that's concerning. The main points are that the friend was moving too fast, got dumped, then started threatening suicide and harassing the ex-girlfriend. The author told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author had a valid reason to confront their friend. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, possibly stalking. The author's friends agree with them, which suggests they're not just being mean. But the author's approach might have been harsh. Saying \"creepy and pathetic\" could come off as cruel, especially when someone is in a fragile mental state.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help their friend stop harmful behavior. On the other hand, the way they delivered the message might not have been supportive enough. The friend was already in a crisis, so a more empathetic approach might have been better. However, the author isn't wrong for pointing out the issue; the problem is more about the tone and method rather than the content of the message.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's intervention was necessary and appropriate. Since the friend was acting in a way that endangered himself and others, the author had a responsibility to intervene. But the wording used might have exacerbated the situation. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but their approach could have been improved. The friends' agreement supports that the author's intention was right, even if the delivery was harsh.\n"
