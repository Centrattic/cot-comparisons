He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The friend was acting out after a breakup, including threatening self-harm and stalking behavior. The author intervened and told him to stop, which led to being kicked out. The friends agree with the author's message but think it could have been done more nicely.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The friend's behavior (calling the ex, threatening self-harm, maybe showing up at her place) is definitely concerning and potentially abusive. The author was trying to help by telling him to stop, which is a reasonable response to prevent further harm. However, the way it was done might have been harsh. The friends suggested a nicer approach, but the content of the message was correct. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's actions are problematic and need to be addressed, the author's message was accurate (he was being creepy and needed to stop), and while the delivery could have been better, the intent was to help. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the behavior. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's response. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
