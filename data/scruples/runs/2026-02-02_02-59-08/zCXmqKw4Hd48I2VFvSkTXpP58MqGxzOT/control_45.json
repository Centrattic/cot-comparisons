He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting out after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. After, he's having a mental health crisis, threatening suicide, and trying to contact the ex. The author confronts him, calls him creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's emotionally unstable, showing signs of needing help with anxiety and possibly depression. His actions (threatening self-harm, stalking, obsessive behavior) are harmful, not just to the ex but also to himself. The author's concern is valid because this behavior can escalate.\n\nBut the author's approach was to confront him directly when he was in a fragile state. While the message might be right (the friend needs to stop), the method could be questioned. The friend was in crisis and being aggressive might not be the best way to help. Friends agreed with the message but suggested a nicer approach. \n\nHowever, the author's intent was to help, not harm. The friend's actions are dangerous, and someone needed to step in. The key is whether the author overstepped. Confronting a friend during a mental health crisis can be tricky. While it's important to address harmful behavior, doing so in a compassionate and supportive way is usually more effective. \n\nThe author's words (\"creepy and pathetic\") might have been harsh, but the underlying message was correct. The problem isn't the content but the delivery. However, given the urgency of the situation and the friend's instability, the author might be justified in being direct. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's behavior needed to be addressed. However, there's room for improvement in the approach. The answer is B because the author had a valid reason to speak up, even if there could be a better way to do it.\n"
