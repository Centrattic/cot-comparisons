He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm and contacting the ex, which is clearly not healthy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic. Calling 911 because he was threatening himself is serious. The ex wants space, and the friend isn't respecting that. The author intervened by directly confronting him, which led to a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author's approach was wrong. The friends said they agree with the author but maybe it could have been handled nicer. The author's intention was to help, right? They were trying to stop their friend from doing something harmful. Even if the delivery was harsh, the content\u2014pointing out the creepy and pathetic behavior\u2014was valid because the friend was acting inappropriately.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? Well, the answer depends on the justification. If the author's words, while harsh, were truthful and aimed at stopping harmful behavior, it's more about the necessity of the message over the delivery. The key point here is that the friend's actions were not okay, and the author was trying to make him see that. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were addressing real issues, even if the tone could have been better. The friends agree, so it's not just the author's opinion. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
