Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend where the boyfriend cooked a stew for himself, gave the leftovers to the girlfriend, and then forced her to do the dishes. The girlfriend got angry at his behavior and called him out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend is in a difficult financial situation, can't afford meat often, and relies on the boyfriend's cooking. The boyfriend cooked for himself, then gave her leftovers, which she felt were insufficient. Then he asked her to clean up, leading to a confrontation. She called him out on being unkind, and he responds aggressively, calling her names. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and consideration in a relationship. The boyfriend's actions of giving leftovers instead of cooking for both could be seen as selfish, especially since he's not in financial trouble. Forcing her to clean up after cooking, especially when she didn't cook, is also problematic. The girlfriend's frustration seems justified given her situation. However, her response was to confront him with an outburst, which escalated the situation. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. If she felt disrespected, she had every right to express that. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing her, restraining her, and aggressive language\u2014is definitely wrong. The girlfriend's outburst might have been a reaction to ongoing disrespect, not just this incident. So, considering the context, her frustration is understandable. The boyfriend's actions were the root of the problem here. Therefore, the author (the girlfriend) isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, even if her method was blunt. The boyfriend's behavior was the issue.\n"
