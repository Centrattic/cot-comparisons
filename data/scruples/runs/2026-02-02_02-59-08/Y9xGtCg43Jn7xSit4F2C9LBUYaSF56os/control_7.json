Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself, gave the leftovers to his girlfriend, and then expected her to clean the dishes. The girlfriend, who's struggling financially and can't cook much, snapped at him.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooked for himself, not for her. She asked for a portion, but he refused. Later, he gave her the leftovers, which were minimal. Then he demanded she clean the dishes, leading to a confrontation. The key points here are about mutual respect, fairness in responsibilities, and the context of their living situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem to lack consideration. He had enough ingredients to make two portions but only cooked for himself. Giving her leftovers and then expecting her to clean up without making a meal for her might be seen as unfair. The girlfriend's frustration is understandable given her financial situation and the fact that she can't cook much herself. \n\nPushing and restraining her is never acceptable, though. But the main question is about whether she's in the wrong for expressing her frustration. She was put in a position where she had to rely on his leftovers, which he didn't initially offer. Then being forced to clean up after him, despite him not cooking for her, seems unfair. \n\nThe girlfriend's outburst was in response to his aggression and unfair expectations. She's not in the wrong for pointing out the lack of kindness and the imbalance in their responsibilities. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to cook for her, giving minimal leftovers, and then being aggressive\u2014shows a lack of support and consideration. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She has valid reasons for her frustration given the circumstances. The boyfriend's actions were the main issue here.\n"
