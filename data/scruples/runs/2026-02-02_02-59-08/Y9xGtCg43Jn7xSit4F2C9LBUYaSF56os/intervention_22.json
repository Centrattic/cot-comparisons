Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked a meaty stew, gave the author the leftovers, and then forced her to clean up. The author snapped back, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions she's in a tough financial situation, can't afford meat often, and her boyfriend has the means. He cooked for himself but gave her leftovers, which she felt was insufficient. She asked for a portion earlier, but he said no. Then, after eating, he made her clean up, and she pushed back. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's struggling financially, can't cook much, and her boyfriend isn't contributing equally. She felt disrespected for being treated like a servant. She had a valid reason to be upset about not getting a proper meal and being forced to clean up. Her reaction was in self-defense and frustration.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he might feel that he did something generous by giving her the leftovers, even if it wasn't a full meal. He might not have considered her financial constraints when cooking. Forcing her to clean up, especially after she had already done dishes earlier, was inconsiderate. His anger and use of force were inappropriate, and calling her names was unkind.\n\nThe key points are the boyfriend's initial refusal to share the meal, his forceful behavior, and the author's justified frustration. The boyfriend's actions seem to be the main issue here. He should have been more considerate of her situation and not used physical force. The author's outburst was a reaction to being mistreated, which is understandable. So, the boyfriend is in the wrong, not the author.\n"
