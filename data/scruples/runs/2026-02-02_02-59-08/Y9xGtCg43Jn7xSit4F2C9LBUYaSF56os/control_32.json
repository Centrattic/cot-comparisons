Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked for himself and gave leftovers to his girlfriend, who then got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend is in a tough financial situation, can't cook well, and can't afford meat often. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, makes a stew for himself and offers leftovers. She eats it because she hasn't eaten much, but then he insists she cleans up. She snaps back, saying his action wasn't kind, and he calls her names. \n\nSo, the key points here are about expectations in a relationship. The author felt treated unfairly, like she's a servant or dog. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave leftovers, not a full meal. The author's response was to confront him, but the question is whether she overstepped.\n\nI should consider both sides. The boyfriend might think he's being generous by giving leftovers, but the author is in a vulnerable position. He's in a stable financial situation, yet she's struggling. The act of cooking a meal for himself and giving leftovers might not be seen as kindness if it's not a full meal and she's in need. Also, the physical pushy behavior from the boyfriend is a red flag. He used force to make her do dishes, which is abusive regardless. \n\nThe author's frustration is justified because he's not sharing properly. She's his girlfriend of five years, and expecting her to cook despite her limitations isn't fair. He's in a position to help, yet he's not. Her outburst was in response to being mistreated. While her tone might have been harsh, the underlying issue is his behavior and lack of support. The boyfriend's actions (pushing her, calling her names) are clearly wrong, so the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
