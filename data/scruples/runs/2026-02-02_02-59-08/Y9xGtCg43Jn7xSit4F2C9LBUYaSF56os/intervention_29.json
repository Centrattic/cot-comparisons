Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's poor due to medical expenses and can only afford basic groceries. She can't cook well and hates cooking. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, made a meaty stew. She asked for a portion, but he refused. Later, he offered the leftovers, which were minimal. After she ate, he made her clean the dishes, which she said wasn't her responsibility. She snapped, telling him he wasn't kind, and he called her ungrateful.\n\nLooking at the dynamics here, the boyfriend's actions seem to be part of the problem. He cooked for himself and then gave her leftovers. Offering leftovers might not be the same as cooking for her. The author felt disrespected because he didn't cook a proper meal for her, which she might feel is expected in a relationship. Also, his reaction of pushing her and being angry seems abusive. The author's frustration is understandable given her financial situation and the stress of not cooking well. Her outburst might be a response to his controlling behavior. \n\nThe key points are: the boyfriend's refusal to share the meal he made, his physical aggression, and the author's response to being mistreated. The boyfriend's actions\u2014especially the physical restraint\u2014cross a line. The author's reaction, while maybe not the calmest, is in response to being treated poorly. \n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's behavior being abusive and the author's justified anger due to his actions, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
