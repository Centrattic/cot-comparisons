Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author is struggling financially, can't afford much, and isn't a good cook. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew. She asks for a portion since he's already cooking, but he says no. Later, he offers her leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats them, then he makes her clean up the dishes. This leads to an argument where she snaps and calls him out for being unkind. He responds angrily, calling her an ungrateful bitch.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness and respect in the relationship. The author feels taken advantage of. She's in a vulnerable position financially and asked for a reasonable request\u2014since he's cooking, why not share? But he refused. Then he offers her leftovers, which are minimal, and expects her to clean up. That seems unfair. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to share the meal he prepared, giving her scraps, and then making her clean up\u2014could be seen as disrespectful and entitled.\n\nThe author's outburst is a reaction to being treated poorly. She's pointing out that his actions aren't kind; he's not sharing equally. His response is aggressive, which is a problem. The fact that he pushed her and restrained her adds a physical element, which is concerning and possibly abusive.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, mutual respect and consideration are important. The boyfriend's actions don't reflect that. The author has the right to feel that she's being treated unfairly, especially given her financial situation. Her frustration is understandable. The boyfriend's refusal to share the meal and the subsequent confrontation might be more about his own behavior than her being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. She's standing up for herself against mistreatment.\n"
