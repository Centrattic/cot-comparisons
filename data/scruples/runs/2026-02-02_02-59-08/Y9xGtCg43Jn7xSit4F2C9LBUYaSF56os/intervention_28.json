Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong in their actions. The situation involves the boyfriend cooking only for himself and giving the author leftovers, which she felt was inadequate. She then snaps at him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior: he cooked for himself and gave the author leftovers, which she felt was not generous. He also made her clean up even though he was the one who cooked. That seems unfair. He pushed her, which is physical aggression and definitely wrong. His reaction to her pointing that out by calling her names is also problematic.\n\nThe author's actions: She was hungry, asked for food, got leftovers, and then after being mistreated, she confronts him. Her outburst about not being his dog might come off as harsh, but considering his behavior, her frustration is justified. She didn't initiate the conflict; she was reacting to his actions.\n\nFinancial situation: The author is in a tough spot, can't afford meat, so relying on leftovers is a stretch. The boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, so he could have done more to support her. His refusal to cook for her and then expecting her to clean up despite cooking himself is unfair.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's physical aggression and lack of support. The author's reaction, while maybe a bit strong, stems from being mistreated. She's standing up for herself after being pushed and disrespected. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here.\n"
