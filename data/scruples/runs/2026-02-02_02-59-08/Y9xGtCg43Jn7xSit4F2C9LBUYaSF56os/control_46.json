Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of how he treats her. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author can't cook and is struggling financially, buying only basics like bread, milk, and pasta. Meat is expensive, so she can only afford it every two weeks. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew for himself. She asks for a portion, but he refuses. Later, he offers the leftovers, which are minimal. Then he expects her to clean up, even though he was the one who cooked. She pushes back, saying he didn't cook for her and that his behavior is unreasonable. He gets angry, calls her names, and she snaps back.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's actions. He refused her request for a portion when he could have easily made two. Then, after eating, he gave her leftovers as a \"kind\" gesture, but that's not the same as cooking for her. Expecting her to clean up after cooking for himself is also problematic. The author is pointing out that his behavior is unkind and that he's treating her like a servant. \n\nFinancial hardship and health issues add to her stress. She's not in a position to cook, and he's in a better financial state. His refusal to share the meal he made and expecting her to do dishes after he cooked is unfair. The physical pushing and angry reactions from him are red flags for abusive behavior. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid. She's in a long-term relationship and expects mutual respect and support. His actions don't reflect kindness or consideration. The fact that he calls her names after she stands up for herself shows a lack of respect. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings. She's highlighting the imbalance and mistreatment in the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not hers.\n"
