Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation: The author is in a 5-year relationship. She's struggling financially, can't afford to cook much, and is terrible at cooking. Her boyfriend, who's not in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew, but only for himself. She asks him to make a portion for her, but he says no. Later, he gives her the leftovers, which are barely a snack. Then he pushes her to clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She snaps, tells him he's being unreasonable, and he calls her names.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boyfriend's actions. He had the means to buy ingredients and cook, but only made for himself despite knowing her situation. Giving her leftovers isn't really being kind if it's just a snack. The fact that he pushed her to clean up after cooking, even though she had already done dishes earlier, shows a lack of consideration. His reaction was aggressive, using physical restraint and abusive language. That's definitely toxic behavior.\n\nOn the author's side, she's in a tough spot financially. She's trying to survive with limited resources. When he offered a tiny portion, she accepted out of necessity, not because she wanted to be in his debt. Then, when he tried to make her do his dishes after he cooked, she stood up for herself. Her outburst was in response to his abuse and unfair treatment. She's pointing out the hypocrisy in his \"kindness\" when he didn't actually help her properly.\n\nThe key issues here are emotional abuse and unequal treatment. The boyfriend's actions\u2014pushing her, calling her names, and taking advantage of her situation\u2014are clear signs of a toxic relationship. The author, while maybe not perfect in her response (though her frustration is understandable), is reacting to mistreatment. She's asserting her rights in a relationship where she's been treated poorly. \n\nSo, the boyfriend is clearly in the wrong with his behavior. The author isn't wrong for standing up for herself in that context. Even if she had a harsh way of expressing it, the underlying issue is the boyfriend's abusive actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
