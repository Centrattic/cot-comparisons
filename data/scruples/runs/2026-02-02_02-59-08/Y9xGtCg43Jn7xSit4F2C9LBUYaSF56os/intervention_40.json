Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend cooking a stew for himself, giving her only a small portion, then forcing her to clean up. The author snaps and yells at him, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's behavior seems problematic. He had the means to cook a proper meal for both, but chose not to. Instead, he gave her leftovers after eating most of it. That's not generous. Then, he physically pushed and restrained her, which is abuse. The author was justified in feeling disrespected and treated poorly.\n\nThe author's reaction was in response to being physically mistreated and feeling taken advantage of. She pointed out the unfairness of the situation. While yelling might be seen as a poor reaction, the context of abuse and neglect changes things. The boyfriend's actions (not cooking for her, giving minimal food, using force) are more blameworthy.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue. The author is standing up for herself after being mistreated. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
