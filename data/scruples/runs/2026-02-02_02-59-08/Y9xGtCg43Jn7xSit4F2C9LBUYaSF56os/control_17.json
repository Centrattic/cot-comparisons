Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend cooking a stew for himself, giving her leftovers, and then expecting her to do the dishes. The author reacts by telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog or a roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is financially struggling, can't afford meat often, and isn't a good cook. When she asked for a portion of the stew he was making, he said no. Later, he gave her leftovers but then made her clean up. The author felt disrespected because she wasn't treated as a partner but more like a servant. She snapped at him, leading to an argument.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking for himself, giving leftovers, expecting her to do dishes. The author's response was to confront him about feeling treated poorly. The question is whether the author is wrong for speaking up.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and equity are important. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be taking advantage of her situation. He's in a better financial position and expected her to cook, which she can't do easily. By giving her leftovers and then making her clean up, he's not being considerate. The author's frustration is justified given her circumstances. She's not the one in the wrong here for standing up for herself. The boyfriend's actions were disrespectful, so the author isn't at fault.\n"
