Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The situation is about a boyfriend who cooks for himself and gives the author leftovers, then gets angry when she doesn't clean the dishes immediately. The author feels she's being treated unfairly, like a dog or a roommate, not a partner.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions financial struggles, can't afford meat often. The boyfriend cooks for himself, offers leftovers, which the author eats. Then he makes her clean the dishes, gets physical, and calls her names. The author responds by standing up for herself, leading to a fight.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's actions seem problematic. Cooking for himself and giving leftovers isn't really an act of kindness if he's not contributing to the meal. Also, using physical force and yelling is definitely wrong. The author's response was to express frustration, which is understandable given the circumstances. She's in a financial bind and feeling taken for granted. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into emotional and physical abuse. The author isn't at fault here. So the answer is B.\n"
