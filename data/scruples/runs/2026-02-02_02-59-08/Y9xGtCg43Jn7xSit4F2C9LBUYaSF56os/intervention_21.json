Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions being a terrible cook and currently struggling financially because of medical expenses. She can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta, with meat being a luxury she can get once every two weeks. \n\nTonight, her boyfriend cooked a meaty stew. She asked if she could have a portion since he was cooking anyway, and he said no. Later, he offers her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. After eating, she tries to put the dish in the sink, and he corners her to clean the dishes. She argues that he cooked, so it's his responsibility. He gets angry, pushes her, and restrains her. She snaps back, saying he wasn't being kind and that he gave her leftovers. He calls her an ungrateful bitch and says he'll never cook for her again.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. They want to know if she's in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend's actions: he cooked for himself, refused to make a portion for her, gave her small leftovers, then expected her to clean up after. He used physical force and threatening language. That's pretty clear abuse\u2014physical and emotional. His behavior is controlling and disrespectful.\n\nThe author's response: she stood up for herself after being pushed and restrained. She pointed out his lack of kindness, which is reasonable. She's in a vulnerable financial situation and can't cook for herself. Expecting her to cook when she's unable is unfair. Her reaction might have been emotional, but considering the abuse she faced, it's justified.\n\nSo, the key issues here are the boyfriend's abusive behavior and the author's self-defense. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up against abuse. The boyfriend's actions are the main problem. Even if her response was sharp, it's a reaction to his wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
