  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a conflict between the author and her boyfriend over cooking and cleaning. \n\nFirst, the author mentions she's not a good cook, hates cooking, and has financial issues, so she can't afford meat often. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooked a stew for himself and gave her leftovers after she asked for a portion. She ate the leftovers but was later forced by him to clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She got angry and called him out for not being kind, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are the financial disparity, the unequal distribution of chores, and the physical altercation. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which she felt was insufficient. Then, he pushed and restrained her when she refused to clean up. The author's frustration seems justified given her circumstances. She's being treated unfairly in terms of chores and meals, especially considering her financial limitations. The boyfriend's actions\u2014pushing her and calling her an ungrateful b*tch\u2014are abusive and unacceptable regardless of the situation. \n\nThe author's response was to stand up for herself after being mistreated. While she might have handled it differently, the core issue lies in the boyfriend's behavior, including physical aggression and lack of consideration. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her dissatisfaction and setting a boundary, especially when her needs aren't being met and she was physically threatened. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
