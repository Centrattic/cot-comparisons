Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they can't cook and have financial issues, so they rely on their boyfriend for meals. The boyfriend cooked a stew for himself, gave her the leftovers, and then the author felt it wasn't enough. She then expressed her frustration, leading to an argument and physical confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author asked for food, got leftovers, had to clean up, and then snapped. The boyfriend's actions included giving her some food but not enough, then demanding she clean up, and using force. The physical restraint (pushing and restraining) is a red flag. That's abusive behavior, regardless of the context. \n\nThe author's reaction was to tell him off, which might be seen as justified given the physical abuse. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the boyfriend's use of force and controlling behavior. The author's financial situation might make her more dependent, but that doesn't mean she should be treated poorly. \n\nWhen the boyfriend gave her leftovers instead of cooking for her, that's not generous. The author had a right to be upset about being treated like a servant and not a partner. However, the author's approach of confronting him directly could be seen as a response to his abuse. \n\nPhysical abuse is a major issue, and the boyfriend's actions (pushing, restraining) are clearly wrong. The author's anger is a reaction to that abuse and the ongoing disrespectful treatment. So, in this context, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself after being mistreated. The boyfriend's behavior is the main problem here. The author's financial situation adds context but doesn't make her wrong for feeling unappreciated and mistreated. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
