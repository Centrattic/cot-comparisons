  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman in a 5-year relationship. She's facing financial difficulties due to medical expenses and can't afford to cook meals regularly. She's not a good cook and avoids cooking. Her boyfriend, who isn't struggling financially, cooks a meaty stew for himself but refuses to make her a portion. Later, he offers her the leftovers, which are minimal. After she eats, he demands she clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She gets angry, tells him off, and he calls her names.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in the relationship. The author is not in a position to cook, especially with her financial constraints. The boyfriend, being more financially stable, could have made a meal for both. However, he only made for himself and later expects her to clean up. The author's frustration stems from feeling treated unfairly, as if she's his servant or dog, not his partner.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions seem selfish. He had the means to cook for both but didn't, then took advantage of the situation by making her clean. The author's outburst is a reaction to his controlling behavior and lack of consideration. She's pointing out that his \"kindness\" was minimal and that he's not being generous. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and support are essential. The boyfriend's behavior comes off as manipulative and disrespectful, especially given the author's situation. The author's response, while perhaps emotionally charged, is a valid expression of her feelings of being undervalued. He should have been more considerate and shared the meal equally without expecting her to do the dishes, especially since she didn't cook. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and the way he treated her are the main issues here. The answer should be B.\n"
