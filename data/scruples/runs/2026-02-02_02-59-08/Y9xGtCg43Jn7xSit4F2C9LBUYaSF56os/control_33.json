Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooked a stew for himself and had leftovers. The author asked for a portion since they couldn't afford meat. The boyfriend said no. Then, after eating his meal, he gave her the leftovers. The author ate it but then had to do the dishes. When she tried to put the dish in the sink, he cornered her, pushed her, and told her to clean. The author snapped, telling him he was acting like an idiot for thinking he was being kind. He called her names and said he wouldn't cook for her again.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is in a financial situation where she can't cook much, and the boyfriend is not in financial trouble. The boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers as a \"kind\" act, but the author feels that he's treating her like a dog or a roommate. The key points here are about respect, mutual support in a relationship, and the boyfriend's controlling behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend cooking for himself and giving her leftovers might be seen as a gesture, but the way he handled it was problematic. He refused to make her a proper meal, then expected her to clean up after eating his leftovers. His reaction when she refused was physically aggressive (pushing and restraining), which is a red flag. The author's outburst was a response to his abuse, but she's questioning if she was wrong to speak her mind.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other. The boyfriend's actions suggest a lack of consideration for the author's financial situation and her needs. His behavior crosses into abusive territory with the physical restraint. The author's frustration is justified because she's being treated disrespectfully. The fact that she's in a vulnerable position (poor, can't cook, etc.) and the boyfriend isn't helping but instead being controlling is a problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here. She's standing up for herself after being mistreated. Her reaction is a response to his mistreatment, not the cause of it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
