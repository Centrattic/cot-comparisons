Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions she's not a good cook and struggles financially, so she can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta, with meat once every two weeks. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew for himself. She asks if she can have a portion too, but he refuses. Later, he offers the leftovers, which are barely two spoonfuls, and she eats that. Afterward, when she's putting the dish in the sink, he corners her, demands she clean the dishes, and gets angry when she points out that he was the one who cooked. She loses her temper, tells him that what he did wasn't kind and that he was treating her like a dog or a roommate. He calls her an ungrateful bitch and says he'll never cook for her again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break down the dynamics. The key points here are the boyfriend's actions and the author's response. The author is in a financial situation where cooking isn't feasible for her. She asked for a portion of the stew he was making, but he refused. Then he gave her leftovers after eating his own meal. She eats that because she hasn't had a proper meal all day. When she leaves the dishes, he tries to make her clean up, even though he was the one who cooked. She refuses and confronts him about his behavior, leading to an argument.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel that by giving her some of his meal, he was being generous. However, the author's perspective is that he's not being kind, because he cooked for himself and then gave her leftovers, which isn't a proper meal. She's also pointing out that he's treating her like a dog or roommate by expecting her to do the dishes after he cooked without making a proper meal for both of them.\n\nLooking at the boyfriend's actions: he cooks for himself, denies her a portion initially, then gives her leftovers. When she's done, he expects her to clean up, even though he was the one who cooked. That seems unfair. The expectation that she should clean up after he cooked for himself, even if he gave her leftovers, is a problem. Also, his reaction of pushing her and calling her names is abusive, which is a big red flag.\n\nThe author's response was to stand up for herself after being pushed and cornered. She's pointing out that his actions weren't kind and that she's not a pet or a roommate. Her frustration is justified given her financial situation and the fact that she's in a long-term relationship where mutual support is expected. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014refusing to cook a meal for both, giving her leftovers, then expecting her to clean up\u2014shows a lack of consideration and generosity. The physical pushing is also a form of abuse, which is unacceptable.\n\nSo, the author's anger and response to his abusive behavior and lack of support are understandable. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself after being mistreated. The boyfriend is in the wrong for his actions, including the physical aggression and the way he treated her. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
