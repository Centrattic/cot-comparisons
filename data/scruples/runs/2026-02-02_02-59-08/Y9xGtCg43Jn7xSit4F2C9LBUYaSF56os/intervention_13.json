Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself and then gave the leftovers to his girlfriend, who was hungry. The girlfriend then told him she's tired of being treated like a dog, leading to an argument where he pushed her and she responded with anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both perspectives. The boyfriend cooked for himself, gave her leftovers, and then expected her to clean up. The author feels that this was not kind because he didn't cook for her directly, and she was in a financial situation where even the small amount he gave was appreciated. However, she snapped and called him an idiot, leading to him yelling at her.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions might be seen as selfish. He had the means to buy ingredients, and she's struggling financially, so expecting her to cook despite her lack of cooking skills and resources might be unreasonable. By giving her leftovers instead of cooking for her, he might be treating her as an afterthought. His reaction of pushing her is definitely abusive, regardless of the situation. That's a red flag and needs to be addressed.\n\nThe author's response was to confront him, which could be seen as justified given the physical abuse. However, her tone and words\u2014calling him an idiot\u2014might have been harsh. But given the context of being in a relationship for five years, expecting mutual support is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior sets a poor precedent, treating her as a servant or roommate instead of a partner.\n\nFinancial struggles add another layer. The author's inability to cook due to financial issues and lack of cooking skills isn't something she chose, so expecting her to handle meal prep isn't fair. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, could have been more considerate and cooked for both of them. His action of giving leftovers instead of preparing a full meal for her might be seen as neglectful, especially when she's in need.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's physical aggression and the toxic dynamic where he expects her to do chores without reciprocation. The author's frustration is understandable, and her boundary-setting (\"not his dog or roommate\") is valid. However, the way she expressed her anger\u2014snapping at him\u2014might have been a mistake, but given the context, it's a reaction to being pushed and demeaned.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the boyfriend's physical abuse is a major issue. The author's anger is a response to his mistreatment. While her communication could be improved, the root problem lies with his abusive behavior and lack of support. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing her frustration, especially given the power imbalance in the relationship.\n"
