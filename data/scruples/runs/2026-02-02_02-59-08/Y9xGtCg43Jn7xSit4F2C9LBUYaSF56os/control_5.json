Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to figure out the answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're a terrible cook and can't afford meat often. Their boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, makes a stew with meat, which is more expensive. The author asks for a portion because he's cooking anyway, but the boyfriend says no. Later, the boyfriend gives her his leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. Then he pushes her to clean the dishes, and she snaps at him. He calls her ungrateful, and she feels like she's not being treated as a girlfriend but a dog or roommate.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness in the relationship, communication, and respect. The boyfriend's behavior seems controlling and disrespectful. He's using his cooking as a way to make her feel indebted, even though he only gave her leftovers. The author is frustrated because she's being treated as if she's obligated to do chores after receiving minimal help. \n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to cook a portion for her when he had the ingredients, and then expecting her to clean up, is problematic. The author's reaction is about standing up for herself after being mistreated. The argument is that the boyfriend's actions weren't kind, so her frustration is justified. \n\nI think the boyfriend is in the wrong here. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's pointing out the lack of generosity and respect. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They were asserting their rights in a situation where their boyfriend was behaving inconsiderately.\n"
