Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend who is financially stable. The author has medical expenses and can only afford basic groceries. She's not a good cook and hates cooking. The boyfriend cooks a stew for himself, which the author asks to have a portion of. He says no, but later gives her leftovers, which are minimal. After eating, the author cleans up, but the boyfriend corners her, insists she clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. The author snaps, tells him she's not his dog or roommate, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is in a financial hardship, which is a valid stressor. She's asking for a reasonable portion of the meal she requested, but the boyfriend denies her. When he later gives leftovers, it's not a generous act. The boyfriend's actions of giving leftovers and then demanding she clean up seem unfair, especially since he was the one cooking. The author's outburst is in response to what she perceives as unfair treatment and disrespect.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014denying a request for a meal, giving minimal leftovers, and then expecting her to clean up\u2014could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. The author's frustration stems from feeling used or treated as a servant, not a partner. Her statement about not being a dog or roommate is a reaction to what she sees as a power imbalance.\n\nFinancial stability of the boyfriend is also a factor. If he can afford to cook, sharing a meal would be a logical step, especially since the author is struggling. The boyfriend's refusal to cook for her despite his ability to do so might indicate a lack of consideration.\n\nThe author's actions in speaking up about her feelings, even if confrontational, are a reaction to what she perceives as wrong treatment. The boyfriend's response, calling her names, is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is questionable. The author is defending herself against what she sees as unfair treatment. While her approach might have been harsh, the root issue is the boyfriend's actions. The question is whether the author is wrong for expressing her frustration. Since the boyfriend's actions were the primary cause of the conflict, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
