Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions she's not a good cook, hates cooking, and is currently facing financial issues because of medical expenses. She can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta, with meat being a rare treat once every two weeks. \n\nTonight, her boyfriend (who isn't in financial trouble) made a meat stew. She asked him to make a portion for her since he was cooking anyway. He said no. Later, he offered her the leftovers after eating most of his own meal, which she took because she hadn't eaten properly all day. When she tried to put the dish in the sink, he pushed her and made her feel like she had to clean up. She lost her temper, told him he wasn't being kind, and he called her an ungrateful bitch and said he'd never cook for her again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in a position where he can afford to cook meat stews, while the author is struggling financially. She's asking for a portion of his meal, which he refuses. Then he gives her the leftovers, which is minimal. When she tries to put the dish away, he physically pushes her and demands she clean up. The author's response is to confront him, pointing out that his actions weren't kind. He then escalates the situation with anger and name-calling.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual respect and support are key. The boyfriend's actions here seem to be a lack of support. He's in a better financial position and yet refuses to share his meal, then gives her leftovers and blames her for not cleaning up. The physical push is a form of abuse, which is a serious red flag. The author's anger stems from feeling unappreciated and mistreated, especially given their long-term relationship. She's not a roommate; she's his girlfriend and likely expects more consideration. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of pushing her and using emotional abuse (calling her a bitch) is definitely wrong. The author's outburst is a reaction to being treated poorly. While it's not ideal to snap, the context of being pushed and feeling disrespected might justify her reaction. The core issue here is the boyfriend not being considerate and the physical aggression. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself in this situation. So, the answer should be B, No.\n"
