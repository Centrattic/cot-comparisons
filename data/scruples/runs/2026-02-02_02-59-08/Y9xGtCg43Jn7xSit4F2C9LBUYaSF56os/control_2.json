Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend cooking a stew, giving her leftovers, and then expecting her to clean up. The author then confronts him about being treated poorly.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers. The author asked to have a portion, but he refused. Later, he told her to clean up, which she tried to resist. She called him out for being unkind, leading to an argument. He called her names and said he wouldn't cook for her again.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's behavior. He refused to make a portion for her when he had enough ingredients, gave her minimal leftovers, then expected her to clean up. The author's reaction was to express her frustration, which led to a confrontation. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, mutual respect and consideration are important. The boyfriend's actions seem controlling and disrespectful. He's in a better financial position and yet isn't sharing the meal equally. Forcing her to clean up after giving her scraps is unfair. The author had a right to express her feelings, especially after being treated in a way that felt dehumanizing.\n\nThe boyfriend's justification of \"kindly cooking for her\" is misleading because he didn't actually cook for her. The act of giving leftovers isn't a kind gesture in this context, especially when the portion was insufficient. The author's frustration is valid. She's in a long-term relationship and shouldn't be treated like a servant or a pet.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is in the wrong for his controlling and disrespectful behavior. The author standing up for herself isn't the issue here. Her actions were a reaction to his mistreatment. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
