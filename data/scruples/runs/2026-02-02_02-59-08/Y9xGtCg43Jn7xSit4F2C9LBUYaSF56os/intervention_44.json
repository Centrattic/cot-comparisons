Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. \n\nFirst, the context: The woman is in a financial situation where she can't afford meat often. She's studying and asks her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, to cook a portion for her when he makes stew. He refuses but later gives her the leftovers, which are minimal. Then he demands she cleans the dishes, even though she had cleaned them earlier and he was the one cooking. The situation escalates when she snaps at him, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and fair treatment in a relationship. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share a meal he prepared, then expecting her to clean up, and then using that as a justification to yell at her\u2014seem controlling and disrespectful. The author's outburst is a reaction to feeling taken advantage of. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should contribute and consider each other's needs. The boyfriend's behavior of cooking for himself and giving her leftovers, then expecting her to clean up, without acknowledging her financial struggles or offering to share his cooking, seems unfair. The author's frustration is understandable given the circumstances. Her response, while maybe harsh, stems from feeling undervalued and overworked. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics here, it's the boyfriend's actions that are inappropriate, not the author's for standing up for herself after being mistreated. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
