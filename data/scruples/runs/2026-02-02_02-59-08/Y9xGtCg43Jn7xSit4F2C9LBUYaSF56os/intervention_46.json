Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of being treated like a dog. The situation involves financial struggles and a conflict over cooking.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooks a meal for himself and offers the leftovers, which are minimal. The author eats them but feels disrespected. Then, the boyfriend demands she cleans the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. He pushes her, and she snaps back, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations in the relationship. The author is dealing with financial hardship and can't cook meals. The boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks for himself but gives leftovers. However, he expects her to clean up, which she did earlier. His physical aggression is a red flag. The author's outburst is in response to feeling disrespected and used. She's not the one who initiated the conflict, but her response was harsh. However, the boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing her, calling her a b*tch\u2014is abusive. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other, not take advantage. The boyfriend's actions (refusing to share properly and being aggressive) are wrong. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself after being mistreated. Answer B.\n"
