  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I'm tired of him treating me like a dog?\nI'll try to keep this as short as I can: I'm a terrible cook, I hate to cook and to top it off, due to medical expenses, I'm extremely poor right now, which means the only groceries I can buy are bread, milk and pasta. Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman is struggling financially, can't afford to cook much, and relies on her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, for meals. He cooked a stew for himself and gave her leftovers, which were minimal. She asked for a portion initially, and he refused. Then he demanded she clean the dishes after eating the leftovers. She snapped, told him he wasn't being kind, leading to an argument where he called her an ungrateful bitch.\n\nSo, why is she in the wrong? Well, maybe she should have handled the situation differently. She could have expressed her feelings without snapping, especially considering their five-year relationship. However, his behavior seems abusive\u2014pushing her and calling her names. That's a red flag. The key point is mutual respect. He's acting entitled, treating her like a servant, and she's pushing back against that. \n\nFinancial situations can affect relationships, but he's the one with resources. His actions are controlling, and her reaction is a defense against that. She's not wrong for standing up for herself when he's being abusive. The question is whether she's wrong for expressing her feelings. Since his behavior is the root problem, her standing up for herself isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
