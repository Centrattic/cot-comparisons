Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their boyfriend cooking a stew and giving them leftovers, then expecting them to do the dishes.\n\nFirst, the author is in a financial hardship, unable to afford meat and only buying basics. They asked the boyfriend to cook for them, but he refused. Then he offered the leftovers after eating most of his own meal. The author ate the leftovers, which were minimal, and later was told to clean the dishes by him, even though he was the one who cooked. The author then snapped and told him off, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and fairness in a relationship. The boyfriend is in a better financial situation and could have made a meal for both, but chose not to. Instead, he gave the author leftovers, which weren't enough, and then expected them to do the dishes. The author felt treated poorly, like a servant or dog, not a partner. The boyfriend's actions seem selfish and unkind, especially given the author's situation. The author's reaction, while perhaps confrontational, was in response to being mistreated. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other without expecting one to serve the other like a servant. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning here\u2014using physical force and calling the author names is unacceptable. The author standing up for themselves is justified given the context.\n"
