Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. So the scenario is that the author is in a relationship where they're struggling financially and can't cook much. Their boyfriend cooks a meaty stew for himself, gives the author leftovers, and then expects her to clean up. The author gets upset and tells him off, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is dealing with financial hardship, can't afford meat often, and is not a good cook. They asked for a portion when he was cooking, but he refused. Then he gives her leftovers, which she eats, and then expects her to do the dishes. She gets angry because she feels he's being unkind and treating her like a servant. She calls him out on it, leading to an argument where he yells at her.\n\nFrom the author's standpoint, she's in a tough spot. She can't afford to cook much, and when her partner (who's not struggling financially) cooks for himself, she's expected to take whatever is left. Then he wants her to clean up. She feels like she's being treated unfairly, not as a partner but more like a servant. Her reaction is emotional because she's dealing with stress from financial issues and the relationship dynamics.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he might feel that he's being generous by giving her the leftovers. Maybe he didn't realize how little he was giving her. He might think that since he cooked, she should share the cleanup. However, the key points are that he didn't cook for her initially, only for himself, and then gave her leftovers. Also, the act of cleaning dishes after cooking is usually shared in a relationship, especially if both live together. His reaction of pushing her and calling her names is abusive, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling undervalued and mistreated. She's in a position where she can't meet her own basic needs easily, and the boyfriend isn't helping. When she does get food, she's treated like she should be grateful for scraps and then expected to do the dishes. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014pushing her, restraining her, yelling\u2014crosses into physical and emotional abuse. Even if his actions were based on a misunderstanding, his violence and belittling words are not acceptable.\n\nSo, the author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. She's in a difficult financial situation, and her boyfriend isn't supporting her. His actions were abusive, and her standing up for herself is a valid response. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here, not her reaction to it.\n"
