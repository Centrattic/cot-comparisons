Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they're tired of being treated like a dog.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author can't afford to buy meat often and is struggling with financial issues. They asked the boyfriend to cook a portion for them when he was making a stew, but he refused. Later, he gave them leftovers, which were minimal. Then, the boyfriend made the author clean the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. The author got upset, told him off, and the boyfriend responded angrily.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions: he cooked for himself, gave the author barely enough to eat, and then expected her to clean up. That seems unfair. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014they\u2019re in a financial situation that's not their fault, and the boyfriend isn't contributing equally. The boyfriend's behavior of pushing and restraining the author is also a red flag. Physical aggression in a relationship is never acceptable.\n\nThe author's response was to express their feelings, which is a healthy way to communicate in a relationship. They pointed out the boyfriend's lack of generosity and the imbalance in their dynamic. The boyfriend called them an ungrateful b*tch, which is disrespectful. The author isn't wrong for standing up for themselves in that situation.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author is reacting to mistreatment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
