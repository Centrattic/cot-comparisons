Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The story is about a girlfriend who's struggling financially and her boyfriend who she feels is being unfair.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cooks a stew for himself and is given the leftovers, which are minimal. The author is frustrated because he didn't cook a portion for her upfront and then expects her to clean up. She confronts him about being treated like a dog, leading to an argument where he calls her names.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, so he could have bought enough ingredients for two. By only making one portion, he might be selfish. However, she did ask for a portion later, and he refused. Then, after giving her leftovers, he made her clean up. The author's response was to confront him, which led to the argument.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual respect. The boyfriend's actions\u2014only cooking for himself, giving leftovers, and then making her do dishes\u2014could be seen as unfair, especially since she's in a tough financial situation. The author's outburst was in response to being pushed and restrained, which is a form of abuse. Even if her reaction was harsh, the situation involved potential abuse, which complicates things.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. However, given that the boyfriend used physical force and the author was reacting to mistreatment, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author's frustration is justified given her circumstances. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
