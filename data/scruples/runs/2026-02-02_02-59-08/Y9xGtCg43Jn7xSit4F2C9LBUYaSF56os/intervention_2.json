Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's struggling financially, can't afford meat often, and has medical expenses. She's not a good cook and doesn't like cooking. She asked her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, to cook a portion for her when he made a stew. He initially said no but later gave her leftovers. She ate that because she hadn't eaten much that day. Then, when she tried to clean up, he pushed her and told her to clean the dishes. She snapped back, told him he wasn't kind, and he called her names.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking opinions. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the boyfriend's actions. He cooked for himself, refused to make two portions even though he could have, then gave her leftovers. Then, he pushed her and threatened her, which is physical abuse. That's a serious red flag. His behavior is abusive, so he's clearly in the wrong there.\n\nAs for the author, she asked for a portion when he was cooking. He said no, then gave her leftovers. She ate them because she was hungry. When he pushed her and demanded she do the dishes, she stood up for herself. Her outburst was in response to his abusive actions. She expressed her frustration correctly, pointing out his lack of kindness and the imbalance in their dynamic. She's not to blame for standing up for herself after being mistreated.\n\nFinancial struggles don't mean she's obligated to accept his behavior. The boyfriend's refusal to cook for her, the physical aggression, and the verbal abuse are all on him. The author's response was a reaction to his mistreatment, so she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
