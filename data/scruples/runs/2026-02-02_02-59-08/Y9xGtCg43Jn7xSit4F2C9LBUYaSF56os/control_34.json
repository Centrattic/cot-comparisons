Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves the boyfriend cooking for himself and then giving leftovers to the author, who then gets upset and confronts him. The author is facing financial difficulties and can't cook much, so when the boyfriend cooks a stew, she asks for a portion but he says no. Later, he gives her leftovers, which she eats, then asks her to clean up, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author is struggling financially and can't cook much, so relying on the boyfriend's meal makes sense. When he cooks for himself and gives her leftovers, that's not really an act of generosity. The author points out that a truly kind act would be cooking both portions, not just for himself. The boyfriend's reaction to her pointing this out is aggressive\u2014pushing her and calling her names. The author's response is to stand up for herself, which is understandable. \n\nThe key points are the boyfriend's behavior: he didn't cook for her, gave her minimal leftovers, and then expected her to clean up. His actions don't seem considerate. The author's frustration is about being treated as if she's not a partner but a dependent. The boyfriend's reaction is disrespectful and physically aggressive, which is a red flag. \n\nThe author's confrontation, while perhaps heated, is a response to his mistreatment. She's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, especially after being physically restrained. The boyfriend's actions (pushing her, yelling) are more concerning. The author's financial situation adds context\u2014she's doing the best she can, and the boyfriend isn't helping. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are crucial. The boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of both. The author is justified in feeling unappreciated and treated unfairly. So, the answer would be B; she's not in the wrong.\n"
