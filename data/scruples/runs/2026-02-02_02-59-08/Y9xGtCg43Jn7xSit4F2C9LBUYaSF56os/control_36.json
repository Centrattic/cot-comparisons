Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author has financial difficulties and can't cook much. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a meaty stew for himself. She asks for a portion, but he refuses. Later, he offers her the leftovers, which are minimal. Then he forces her to clean up, even though she had already done dishes earlier. The author snaps and confronts him, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, key points here: The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share a meal he prepared, giving her leftovers, then making her clean up\u2014seem to indicate a lack of consideration. The author's response was to express frustration and stand up for herself after being mistreated.\n\nFinancial constraints are a big part here. She can't afford to cook much, so relying on him for meals is necessary. His refusal to cook for her despite having the means (since he's not in financial trouble) could be seen as selfish. Also, the physical part where he pushes and restrains her is abusive. Even if there's an argument to be made about her tone, the physical aggression makes him clearly wrong.\n\nThe author's anger is a reaction to being treated poorly. She points out that he didn't cook for her, just gave leftovers, and then made her clean up. Her statement about not being his dog or roommate is about the lack of respect and equal partnership. While she could have handled it differently (maybe a calmer conversation), the core issue is his behavior\u2014being ungenerous, controlling, and abusive.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions are the main problem here. The author's response is a reaction to being mistreated. While she might have been confrontational, the root cause is his behavior. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings about his treatment.\n"
