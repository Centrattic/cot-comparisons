Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend cooking a stew for himself and giving the leftovers to the author, but she got upset when he made her clean up and called her names. The author is frustrated because he didn't cook for her properly and treated her like a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is struggling financially and can't afford meat often. She asked her boyfriend to cook a portion for her when he was making stew. He refused, then gave her leftovers, which were minimal. She had to clean up after him, and when she snapped, he called her names and became violent. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions: He cooked for himself, didn't cook for her even though he had the ingredients, gave her leftovers instead of a full meal, and then expected her to clean up. That seems unfair. The author's reaction was in response to his behavior\u2014she was hungry, he didn't provide adequately, and he used that as an excuse to control her (pushing her, being aggressive). \n\nThe author's response: She told him off, which might be seen as justified given the context. She's not in a position to cook, financially strained, and he's in a better financial state. The boyfriend's actions could be considered controlling and self-centered. \n\nIn relationships, equality and respect are important. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014cooking for himself, giving her leftovers, expecting her to clean, and being violent\u2014shows a lack of support and consideration. The author's frustration is valid. Even if her tone was harsh, the underlying issue is about respect and equitable treatment. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overreacted. Given the circumstances\u2014hunger, financial struggle, and being mistreated\u2014the response seems justified. The boyfriend's actions were the root cause. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
