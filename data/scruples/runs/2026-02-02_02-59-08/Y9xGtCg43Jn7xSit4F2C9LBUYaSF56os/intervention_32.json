Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to unpack this situation. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's mentioned being in a tough spot financially, can't cook well, and can only afford basic groceries. Her boyfriend, who's not in financial trouble, made a meaty stew for himself. She asked if she could have a portion too, but he said no. Later, he offered the leftovers, which were just two spoonfuls. She ate it, then when she went to clean up, he pushed her and told her to clean the dishes. She snapped back at him, and now he's upset.\n\nThe author is saying she's tired of being treated like a dog or a roommate. The key points here are about mutual respect, equality in the relationship, and the dynamics of giving and receiving help. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share his meal, then making her clean up after she ate his leftovers\u2014seem controlling and disrespectful. She's pointing out that his gesture wasn't kind because he only gave her leftovers when she asked, and then held that over her head to make her do the dishes. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend is in the wrong for not being generous when he had enough ingredients. Cooking for both is a reasonable request, especially since she's in a difficult position. His reaction of pushing her and yelling is abusive behavior. The author's frustration is justified because she's being treated poorly. However, her response was to confront him, which led to an argument. But given the context of his behavior, her outburst might be a result of pent-up anger.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend's actions are clearly the main issue here. The author's anger is a reaction to being mistreated. So, the answer is likely B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The abuse and disrespect from the boyfriend are the core problems here.\n"
