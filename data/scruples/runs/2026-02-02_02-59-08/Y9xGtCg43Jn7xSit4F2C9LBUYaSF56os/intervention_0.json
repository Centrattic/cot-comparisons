Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. Let me read through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nSo, the author is a terrible cook and can't afford meat often. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, makes a meat stew for himself. She asks him to make a portion for her, but he refuses. Later, he gives her the leftovers, which are only two spoonfuls. Then, after she eats them, he makes her do the dishes, even though he was the one who cooked. She gets angry, tells him he wasn't being kind, and he calls her an ungrateful bitch. She's upset because she feels like he's treating her poorly and she's not his dog or a roommate.\n\nFirst, let's consider the boyfriend's actions. He made the stew for himself and gave her the leftovers. She was in a situation where she couldn't cook for herself because of financial issues and her dislike of cooking. The boyfriend had the means to cook a full meal for both but chose not to. Instead, he gave her the leftovers, which were minimal. Then, he expects her to clean up after him, even though he cooked. That seems unfair because typically, if someone cooks for another person, the expectation might be that they help with cleaning up. But in this case, he didn't cook for her, just gave her leftovers. So, making her do the dishes for something he did for himself seems like an unreasonable request.\n\nThen there's the physical confrontation. He pushed and restrained her, which is abusive behavior regardless of the situation. That's a big red flag. The author's reaction of snapping back might be a response to his aggression and the unfair treatment. She's pointing out that his actions weren't kind, which is valid because he didn't make a proper meal for her. She's in a vulnerable position financially, and he's in a better position but doesn't support her. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's refusal to cook for her despite the ability, giving her minimal leftovers, then making her do the dishes. The physical abuse is a major issue. The author's frustration is understandable given these circumstances. She's not the one at fault here because the boyfriend's behavior is the root of the problem. He's being inconsiderate and abusive, and the author is standing up for herself against unfair treatment.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions are the main issue, and the author had a valid reason to express her frustration.\n"
