Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. They provided a detailed situation where the girlfriend confronts her boyfriend over how he treated her regarding cooking and chores.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a financial situation where she can't afford to cook much, relying on staples like bread, milk, and pasta. Her boyfriend, who isn't in financial trouble, cooks a stew for himself, gives her the leftovers, and then demands she clean up. She gets upset and calls him out, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being ungrateful and she feels treated poorly.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend cooked for himself but gave her leftovers, which she was grateful for. However, he then expects her to clean the dishes, which she feels is unfair because she wasn't involved in cooking. The author's main issue is feeling like she's being treated like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. Her outburst was a reaction to him pushing her and demanding she clean up after giving her minimal food.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as selfish\u2014cooking for himself and not offering to make a meal for her, which would be a more considerate action. However, he did give her some food, which she was grateful for. On the other hand, the author's reaction was emotional, but she had valid reasons for feeling taken for granted. The boyfriend's use of physical restraint (pushing her) is a serious issue regardless.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic for physically restraining her and not considering her needs. The author's frustration is justified given her financial constraints and the unequal treatment in the relationship. Her snapping might have been intense, but it's a reaction to his controlling behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong here because the boyfriend's actions were the root of the problem. The correct answer would be B.\n"
