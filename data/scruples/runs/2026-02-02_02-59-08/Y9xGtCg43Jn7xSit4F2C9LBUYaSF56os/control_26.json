Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's facing financial difficulties due to medical expenses, can't cook well, and can only afford basic groceries. She asked her boyfriend, who is not in financial trouble, to cook a portion for her when he was making stew. He refused, then later offered her the leftovers. She ended up eating those leftovers, which were minimal. Afterward, he pushed her and made her clean the dishes, leading to an argument where she snapped back at him.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about fairness, respect, and mutual responsibilities in a relationship. She's in a vulnerable position financially and can't cook, so relying on her partner for meals is understandable. Her boyfriend's refusal to cook for her when he had the means and ingredients could be seen as selfish. Offering leftovers after refusing to share the meal shows a lack of consideration. His physical aggression (pushing her) and belittling her afterward are clear wrongdoings. The author's outburst, while strong, seems to stem from frustration and being pushed too far. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other without expecting exploitation. She's not wrong for standing up for herself, especially when faced with abuse. The boyfriend's actions are more concerning here. So the answer is likely B.\n"
