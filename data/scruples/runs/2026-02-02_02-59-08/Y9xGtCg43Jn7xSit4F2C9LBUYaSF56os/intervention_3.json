Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a financial struggle. They can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta, and meat once every two weeks. The boyfriend, on the other hand, isn't in financial trouble. He cooks a meaty stew for himself. The author asks to have a portion since he was cooking anyway, but he refuses. Then, after eating his meal, he offers her the leftovers, which are barely enough. The author eats those, then goes to put the dish in the sink, and the boyfriend corners her, telling her to clean the dishes. He gets angry when she resists. The author snaps, tells him he wasn't being kind, and compares herself to a dog, not a roommate. The boyfriend then calls her an ungrateful bitch and says he won't cook for her again.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author is upset about being treated poorly, especially in a financial difficult time. The boyfriend didn't cook for both of them, only himself, and then expected her to clean up after giving her leftovers. The physical push and restraint are definitely on the boyfriend\u2014he shouldn't be violent or aggressive. The author's outburst might be over the top, but maybe understandable given the situation. She's frustrated and maybe feels taken for granted. But when she says \"not his dog or roommate,\" that might be a strong statement that could be seen as dismissive of any shared responsibilities. However, the boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share his meal, being violent, and not considering her need\u2014seem more problematic. The author's anger is a reaction to his disrespect and lack of support. So, maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong more here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She did confront him in a heated way, but given the context, maybe not entirely her fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's actions are worse, and the author's reaction is justified given the circumstances.\n"
