Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in a five-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions she's poor due to medical expenses, so she can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta. Meat is a luxury she can only have once every two weeks. That's tough, obviously. She's not a good cook and hates cooking, but she's in a situation where she can't afford to cook much.\n\nNow, the boyfriend cooks a meaty stew for himself. The author asks if he can make a portion for her, and he says no. She doesn't know why, but she assumes he doesn't like her cooking and isn't generous. Then, after he eats, he offers her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats that because she hasn't had a proper meal. Then, when she goes to put the dish in the sink, he corners her, demands she cleans the dishes, and gets angry when she points out that he cooked and she didn't. He physically pushes and restrains her, calling her ungrateful. She snaps back, telling him that giving her leftovers isn't kind and that he's treating her like a dog. He yells at her and says he'll never cook for her again.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Financial Situation**: The author is in a tough spot financially, which is out of her control. The boyfriend isn't in financial trouble, so he has more resources. She can't afford to cook much herself, which makes her dependent on others for meals, but that's a result of her medical issues. \n\n2. **Request for a Portion**: She asked if he could cook a portion for her. He refused. Since he had enough ingredients, maybe he didn't want to, perhaps out of selfishness or not considering her needs. She's in a position where she can't afford to cook, so expecting her to cook might not be feasible. \n\n3. **Leftovers**: He gave her leftovers, but they were minimal. She was grateful, but it's not a fair trade. She was hungry and had no other option. \n\n4. **Dish Cleaning Incident**: He made her clean the dishes after he cooked for himself. She points out that he cooked, so it's not her responsibility. He physically pushed her, which is a red flag. Physical aggression is a serious issue in relationships.\n\n5. **Her Response**: She called him out for treating her like a dog or a roommate. She expressed her frustration, which seems justified given the circumstances. \n\n6. **His Reaction**: He used abusive language, called her names, and said he'd never cook for her again. That's harmful behavior.\n\nNow, considering all this, is she in the wrong? Let's look at the dynamics. The boyfriend is in a position of privilege (financially stable), while the author is struggling. He's not being considerate of her situation. He cooked for himself, gave her scraps, and then expected her to clean up. That's not a healthy dynamic. His physical aggression is a major issue. The author's frustration is understandable. She's being treated unfairly, and her outburst is a response to ongoing issues, not just this one incident. \n\nThe key here is the boyfriend's behavior: refusing to help, giving minimal leftovers, demanding she clean without a valid reason, and using physical force. These are not acceptable. The author defending herself against his abuse isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself in a situation where she's being mistreated. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's in a difficult situation and her reaction is a justified response to being mistreated and disrespected.\n"
