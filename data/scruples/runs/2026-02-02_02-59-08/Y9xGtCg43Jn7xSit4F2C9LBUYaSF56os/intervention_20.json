Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves the boyfriend cooking a stew for himself and giving the leftovers to the author, who then gets upset and tells him she's tired of being treated like a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. The author mentions she's poor, can't afford meat often, and relies on her boyfriend's leftovers. The boyfriend is financially stable. He cooks a stew for himself and offers her the leftovers, which she accepts. Then he tells her to clean up, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's actions. He cooked for himself and gave her the leftovers, which she felt was insufficient. He then expects her to clean up, and when she resists, he uses physical force. The author's outburst is in response to his physical aggression and perceived lack of consideration.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The boyfriend's behavior includes physical aggression (pushing and restraining) and verbal abuse (calling her a b*tch). That's a red flag. The author's reaction to his violence is understandable. The boyfriend's refusal to cook a proper meal for her despite her circumstances and then treating her as if she should be grateful for the leftovers might be contributing to her frustration.\n\nFinancial disparities in a relationship can create power imbalances. The boyfriend has the means to cook for both but chooses not to, expecting her to handle her own meals. His actions of giving leftovers and then holding her responsible for cleaning might be seen as exploiting her situation. The author's response, while perhaps confrontational, is a reaction to his aggression and lack of support.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's physical abuse is a clear violation. The author's outburst is a reaction to that abuse and her own feelings of being unappreciated. The question is whether she was wrong to express her frustration. Given the context of his abusive behavior, it's less about her being in the wrong and more about his actions being unacceptable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's actions are problematic, and her response is justified given the circumstances.\n"
