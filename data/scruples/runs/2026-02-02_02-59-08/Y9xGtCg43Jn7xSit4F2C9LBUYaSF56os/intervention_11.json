Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend who cooked a stew for himself and gave the leftovers to his girlfriend, who couldn't cook herself. The author is upset because he didn't make a meal for her, just gave leftovers, and then she snapped when he asked her to clean up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in financial trouble, can't afford meat often, so when her boyfriend cooks, she's grateful even if it's leftovers. But she's frustrated that he didn't cook for her properly. He cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which she felt was insufficient and not kind. Then, when she tried to clean up, he pushed her and demanded she clean the dishes, which she did earlier. She snapped and called him out on being unkind, and he retaliated with insults.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From my view, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. He had the means to cook for both but only did for himself. Giving leftovers after she asked for a portion is not generous, especially considering her financial situation. Then, after she ate the leftovers, he made her clean up, which seems unfair because she didn't cook. His pushing her is physical abuse, which is a serious issue. The author's reaction to his abuse and his lack of generosity could be justified. However, she did snap and call him out in a heated moment. But given the context of his actions (not cooking for her, physical abuse), her reaction might be a result of built-up frustration. So, the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself in an abusive situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
