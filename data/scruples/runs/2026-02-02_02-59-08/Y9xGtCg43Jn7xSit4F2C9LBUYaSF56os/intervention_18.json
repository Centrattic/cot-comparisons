Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who made stew for himself, gave the leftovers to his girlfriend, and then got angry when she didn't clean up. The girlfriend snapped back, and now the user is unsure if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in a difficult financial situation, can't cook well, and has medical expenses. She's struggling to buy groceries, only able to afford basic items. The boyfriend, on the other hand, isn't in financial trouble. He made a stew for himself and then gave her the leftovers, which were minimal. She was hungry and took what he gave, but he then expected her to do the dishes. She pushed back, leading to an argument where she called him out for not being kind and treating her like a dog.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and fairness in the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior seems controlling and disrespectful. He gave her leftovers instead of cooking for both, which isn't generous, especially given her financial situation. Then, he physically pushed her when she refused to do the dishes, which is abusive. The girlfriend's response was a reaction to his mistreatment. She pointed out that his actions weren't kind and that she felt treated poorly. \n\nEven though she might have handled the situation differently, like addressing the issue calmly later, her outburst was a reaction to his abuse. The boyfriend's actions were the root of the problem\u2014cooking for himself, giving her leftovers, and physically restraining her. Her snapping back was in self-defense, both emotionally and physically. The fact that he called her an ungrateful b*tch after his own behavior shows his lack of accountability.\n\nFinancial strain and inability to cook shouldn't make someone a doormat. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into emotional and physical abuse, which is a serious issue. The girlfriend standing up for herself is justified, even if her way of communicating it was heated. The core of the problem lies with the boyfriend's actions, not the girlfriend's response. Therefore, the author (the girlfriend) isn't in the wrong here.\n"
