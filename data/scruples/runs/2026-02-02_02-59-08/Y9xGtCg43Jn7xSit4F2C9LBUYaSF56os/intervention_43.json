Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who cooked for himself and gave leftovers to his girlfriend, who then got upset and told him she was tired of being treated like a dog. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is in a tough financial situation, can't afford meat often, and when the boyfriend cooks a meat-based stew, he initially refuses to make a portion for her. Later, he gives her leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She ends up eating that because she hasn't eaten properly. Then, when she tries to put the dish in the sink, he corners her, forces her to clean up, and gets angry. She snaps back, saying he's being unkind, and he calls her names.\n\nThe author (the girlfriend) is asking if she's in the wrong for speaking up. The user initially thinks she might be in the wrong but wants to know the other perspective.\n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, respect and fairness are important. The boyfriend has the means to buy groceries, but he's not sharing equally. He cooked for himself and gave leftovers, which the girlfriend had to rely on. Then, he's pressuring her to clean up, which seems like an unfair dynamic. The girlfriend is expressing her frustration about being treated poorly, not as an equal partner.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to cook for her when he had the ingredients, giving minimal leftovers, and then demanding she clean up\u2014could be seen as controlling or unequal. The girlfriend's outburst was a reaction to being mistreated, which might be justified given the pattern of behavior.\n\nHowever, the way she responded (snapping and calling him an idiot) might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation, but the core issue is about the treatment she's receiving. The key question is whether her frustration is valid. Given the boyfriend's financial privilege and the power imbalance in the interaction, her standing up for herself might not be the problem. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning, as he's exerting control and not considering her needs.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her frustration stems from being treated unfairly, and her outburst is a reaction to a toxic dynamic rather than an unreasonable complaint.\n"
