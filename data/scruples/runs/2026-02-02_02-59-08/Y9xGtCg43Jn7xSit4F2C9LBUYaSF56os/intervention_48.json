Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of him treating her like a dog. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's in financial trouble, can't afford to cook much, and relies on her boyfriend who has more means. He cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which she felt was insufficient. Then he asked her to clean up, leading to a confrontation where she snapped at him. The boyfriend called her an ungrateful b*tch and vowed never to cook for her again.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to assess both sides. The key points are the boyfriend's actions and the author's response. \n\nHe cooked for himself and gave her leftovers without making a full meal for her. The author felt this wasn't kind, and she was hungry. Then he expected her to do the dishes, which she had already done earlier. He pushed her and restrained her, which is abusive. The author's outburst happened after being physically restrained and feeling undervalued. \n\nConsidering the boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking only for himself, giving minimal leftovers, and then physically restraining her\u2014there's a pattern of controlling and unkind behavior. The author's frustration stems from being treated unfairly and not being supported, given her financial situation. Her snapping might be a response to accumulated stress and his abuse.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is in the wrong for his actions and attitude. The author standing up for herself after being mistreated isn't her fault. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
