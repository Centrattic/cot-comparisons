Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend. She mentions she's a terrible cook, hates cooking, and due to medical expenses, she's poor. She can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta, with meat being a rare luxury. \n\nHer boyfriend, who isn't financially struggling, cooks a meat stew for himself. She asks if she can have a portion since he's making it. He says no, even though there's enough ingredients for two. Then later, he offers her the leftovers after he eats, which is just two spoonfuls. She eats it because she's been without a proper meal all day.\n\nAfter dinner, he makes her clean the dishes, even though she had cleaned earlier and he was the one who cooked. He gets angry, pushes her, and restrains her. She snaps back, telling him she's not his dog or roommate. He yells at her and says he won't cook for her again.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial disparity, unequal sharing of responsibilities, and the boyfriend's controlling behavior. The author is clearly frustrated with being treated unfairly. \n\nThe boyfriend cooked for himself and gave her leftovers, which she interprets as not kind. She's upset because she's supposed to be his girlfriend, not a servant. His actions\u2014refusing to cook for her, giving her leftovers, then making her clean up\u2014seem condescending. The physical aggression is a red flag. \n\nThe author's reaction is in response to being treated poorly. She's standing up for herself after being pushed around, both physically and emotionally. The boyfriend's anger and the use of derogatory language (\"ungrateful b*tch\") show a lack of respect and empathy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is abusive and inconsiderate. The author is justified in being upset about the unequal treatment and the lack of generosity. She's also within her rights to express frustration after being mistreated. The boyfriend's refusal to cook for her, the minimal leftovers, and the physical aggression make it clear that the problem is on his side.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking out against being treated poorly. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
