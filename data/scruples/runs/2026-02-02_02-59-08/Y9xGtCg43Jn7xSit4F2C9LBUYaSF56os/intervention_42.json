Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she's tired of being treated like a dog. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's a terrible cook and can't afford to buy much food right now. She's in financial hardship due to medical expenses, so she relies on the cheapest groceries. Her boyfriend cooks a meat stew for himself when she's studying. She asks for a portion, but he says no. Later, he gives her the leftovers, which are just two spoonfuls. She eats it because she hasn't eaten all day. Then, after she finishes, he makes her clean the dishes, even though she points out it's his responsibility since he did the cooking. He gets angry, pushes her, and calls her names. She loses her temper, tells him off, and he yells at her.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial disparity in the relationship. The boyfriend has more financial stability, which might affect their dynamics. The author is struggling, and she can't afford to cook. The boyfriend cooks for himself but gives her leftovers, which she takes because she's hungry. However, he expects her to clean up, despite her argument that it's his duty. He uses physical force, which is a red flag. The author's frustration leads her to confront him, which results in a heated argument.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The boyfriend's actions\u2014refusing to share the meal he made (even though he had ingredients for two), giving her minimal leftovers, then expecting her to clean up after himself, using physical force\u2014are problematic. The author's response is to express her frustration, which seems justified given the circumstances. She's being treated disrespectfully, and her financial situation adds to the stress. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into abuse with the physical pushing and yelling. The author standing up for herself, even if her words were harsh, could be seen as self-defense against his mistreatment.\n\nThe original question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but others might argue the opposite. The boyfriend's actions are more concerning\u2014using force and being disrespectful. The author is in a vulnerable position financially and is being taken advantage of. Her reaction, while perhaps heated, is a response to his mistreatment. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
