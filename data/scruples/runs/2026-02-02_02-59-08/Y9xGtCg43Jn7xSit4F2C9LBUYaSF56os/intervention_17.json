Since meat is extremely expensive where I live, I can only afford it about once every two weeks.\n\nTonight, I was studying when I saw my boyfriend (who's not in financial trouble yearst all) go to the kitchen to prepare a nice meaty stew. I asked him if he could cook a portion for me too, since he was going to cook anyway. He told me no. I have no idea why he said no, because he clearly had enough ingredients to make two portions, but I assume he just doesn't like my cook and he's not really a generous guy by nature. A while later, he was eating his dish and told me I could have the rest of it since we he was feeling full already. I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day, so I gladly jumped and ate whatever was left of his meal (barely 2 spoonfuls of food). \n\nI went to put the dirty dish on the sink when he cornered me in the kitchen and instructed that I clean the dishes. I told him I had cleaned them earlier and that it was him who had been cooking this time round. He got angry and started pushing me and restraining me, saying that he had been 'very kind' to 'cook me a dish' and that the least I could do was clean up for him. For some reason this made me lose my temper. I snapped and told him that sure, I was going to do the dishes later after I took a shower, but that he was acting like an idiot for thinking he has 'kindly cooked me a dish'. He didn't cook me anything. He cooked for himself and gave me his leftovers, which were barely a snack, just so I wouldn't go to sleep on an empty stomach. There was nothing kind in that. Kind would have been if he made us both dinner. He let go of me but shut the door violently and yelled that I was an 'ungrateful b*tch' and that he was never, ever gonna 'cook' for me again. I sure know that if I wanted to eat, I should have cooked something for myself, but goddamn it. I'm his girlfriend of 5 years, not his dog or roommate. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a 5-year relationship with her boyfriend. She mentions she's a terrible cook, doesn't like cooking, and is struggling financially because of medical expenses. She can only afford basic groceries like bread, milk, and pasta, and meat is a luxury she can only have once every two weeks. \n\nTonight, her boyfriend cooks a meaty stew for himself. She asks if he can make a portion for her, but he says no. Later, he offers her the leftovers after he's done eating, which she takes because she hasn't eaten properly. Then, when she goes to put the dish in the sink, he corners her, insists she clean the dishes, and physically pushes her. She snaps back, tells him off, and he calls her names.\n\nThe author is upset because she feels he's treating her like a dog or a roommate, not a partner. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expressing that frustration and confronting him.\n\nFirst, let's look at his behavior. He cooked for himself, didn't offer to cook for her until after he had eaten, gave her leftovers that were barely enough, and then expected her to clean up. Plus, he physically pushed her when she tried to decline. That's abusive behavior. Physical aggression in a relationship is a red flag, and that's a big issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author took the leftovers without being offered, which might seem like taking without permission. However, given that she's in a relationship and the context of needing food, maybe that's not entirely his fault. But the main issue is his response. He shouldn't have used physical force. The author's outburst was a reaction to his abusive behavior. She was standing up for herself after being mistreated.\n\nThe key points here are the physical aggression and the entitlement he displayed. The author's actions were a response to being pushed and mistreated. She's also in a vulnerable position financially, which complicates things. She's not in the wrong for pointing out his behavior, especially since it's inappropriate and abusive. Even if her tone was harsh, the underlying issue is his actions, not her reaction to them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the problem, not her standing up for herself. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
