TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is a breakup where the guy claims he ended it to be friends, but later says it was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. She moved on by dating others, and now he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy broke up, but maybe he wasn't clear. The author thought it was a breakup and tried to move on. The problem is that the guy's reason for breaking up was actually a test, which is a bit manipulative. He expected her to wait even though he didn't make that clear. \n\nThe author's actions: she used Tinder after the breakup, slept with others. She believed they were no longer a couple, so she felt she had no obligation. But since the guy later claims it was a test, he might see her actions as betrayal. However, if the breakup was mutual and he didn't communicate his intentions, her decision to move on might be reasonable. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being in love and trying to heal by moving on is understandable. However, if the breakup was a test (even if it's a bad idea), maybe she didn't know the context. The guy's behavior seems deceitful. He didn't communicate his true feelings and then got angry when she moved on. \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong. If the breakup was real, then she's not in the wrong. But if the breakup was a test, maybe she did something wrong. However, the test was his idea, and he didn't clarify his intentions. So the fault might lie more with him for being manipulative. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. If he didn't communicate that he was still in love and wanted to test loyalty, then he's at fault for not being upfront. The author tried to heal, which is natural after a breakup. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
