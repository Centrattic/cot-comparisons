TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with her, she thought they were over, and then she started seeing other people. But then she found out that the breakup was actually a test because he was still in love with her. Now he's angry that she slept with others when they were supposedly just friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is whether the breakup was real or a test. If the author believed it was a real breakup, then moving on by sleeping with others might be seen as her right. However, if the guy intended to test her loyalty, then maybe she wasn't in the wrong because he didn't communicate his intentions clearly.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of commitment. If a breakup is declared, even if one party is testing, the other has a right to move on. However, some might argue that if there's lingering feelings, staying friends might not be the best approach. The guy's refusal to talk now complicates things. But from the author's perspective, she followed his decision to be friends and acted accordingly. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author was heartbroken and tried to boost her self-esteem. It's important to consider her emotional state. But the guy's action of using a breakup as a test seems manipulative, which shifts the responsibility away from her. \n\nIn terms of fidelity, if they were not in an exclusive relationship anymore, sleeping with others isn't necessarily wrong. The problem arises if there was an unspoken expectation of monogamy even after the breakup. But since he said they were just friends, she might have thought that expectation was gone.\n\nThe key here is communication. The guy didn't clearly state his intentions, and the author acted based on his stated desire to be friends. If the test was his idea, he's the one who didn't set clear boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted in good faith based on the information given.\n"
