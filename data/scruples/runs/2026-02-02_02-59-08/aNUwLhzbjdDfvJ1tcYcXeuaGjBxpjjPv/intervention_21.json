TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario. \n\nFirst, the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to boost her self-esteem, used Tinder and started sleeping with others. Now, the guy is upset because his friend told her that the breakup was a test to see her reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy said they were broken up, the author thought they were no longer in a relationship, and she started seeing others. The guy later claims the breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful. \n\nFrom a traditional perspective, if someone is in a relationship, they have an obligation of fidelity. But once the relationship is over, the expectation is that each person is free to date others. However, there's a nuance here because the guy never actually said they were in a committed exclusive relationship, but he did break up with her. If the breakup was genuine, then the author's actions are justified. However, if the guy was testing her by faking a breakup, that complicates things. \n\nBut wait, the author believed the breakup was real. She had no reason to think it was a test. So ethically, if the guy led her to believe the breakup was real, then the author's actions are not her fault. However, if the guy was still in love and using a fake breakup as a test, then maybe he's manipulating the situation. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, if you break up with someone, you can't later hold them accountable for moving on if you were deceptive about the breakup's status. The author acted based on the information given to her. She thought the relationship was over, so she started dating others. The guy's anger might stem from his own dishonesty. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she made decisions based on the belief that they were no longer a couple. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being clear about his intentions and setting boundaries. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
