TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, which is a classic example of a breakup where one person later regrets it. \n\nFirst, the author's boyfriend ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author took that at face value and moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. The key point here is whether a breakup was actually mutual or not. Since the boyfriend never confirmed the breakup, he later claims it was a test to see if she would stay faithful. He's upset because she didn't, and now he's blocked her.\n\nSo, the main issue is communication. The boyfriend's actions and reasons are a bit shady. Ending a relationship and then using it as a test is manipulative. However, the author might not be at fault because she acted based on the information she had. If he truly wanted to remain friends and ended the relationship, then technically they weren't in a relationship anymore. Therefore, sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But the problem arises when he later claims it was a test, implying he never intended to break up. \n\nBut in reality, if the relationship was officially over, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the breakup wasn't final and the boyfriend was just testing her loyalty, then she might have made a mistake. But since he didn't communicate this clearly, it's his fault for being deceptive. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't wrong because she acted on the breakup being real. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic because he didn't clarify his intentions. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
