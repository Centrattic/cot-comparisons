TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship where the guy (let's call him John) broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then started dating/talking to others on Tinder because she was trying to move on. Later she found out that John's breakup was actually a test to see if she would stay faithful, and now he's upset she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: John ended the relationship, they were supposed to be just friends after, but John didn't communicate his intentions clearly. The author thought the relationship was over, so she moved on. However, John was using the breakup as a test, which is a bit manipulative.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she believed the relationship had ended. After a breakup, it's natural to seek connections elsewhere, especially if one is still in love and needs validation. However, sleeping with multiple people soon after a breakup might be seen as impulsive, but if the relationship was already terminated, then technically she's within her rights to date others. The problem arises because John didn't clarify the situation and instead tried to manipulate the situation to test her loyalty, which is not healthy in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, John's actions were deceptive. If he truly wanted to test her loyalty, that's a form of emotional manipulation. The author didn't know the breakup was a test, so her actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. Therefore, she isn't at fault for acting on that belief. However, there's a possible breach of trust if John felt the breakup wasn't final, but he didn't communicate that. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning for moving on to boost her self-esteem is understandable. But sleeping with multiple people might not be the best approach, but that's more about personal judgment than right or wrong. The main issue is the lack of clear communication from John. Since he didn't make his intentions clear and then got angry when she moved on, the fault lies more with him for not being honest about his feelings and the nature of the breakup.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had at the time. John's actions were deceptive, and he should have been more transparent about his feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
