TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate the same level of feelings. He ended the relationship, saying they should be friends. The author, heartbroken but eventually accepting, started dating others via Tinder. However, it turns out the guy's breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. He was still in love and wanted to see if she'd remain loyal. When she slept with others, he got angry and blocked her. Now, the author is unsure if she did the wrong thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by sleeping with others after the breakup? The guy said they were just friends, but later claims it was a test. The author didn't know it was a test, so she acted on the information she had. \n\nFrom a typical breakup scenario, if someone ends a relationship and states they want to be friends, the other person is usually free to move on. The author did that, which is a normal reaction to heartbreak. The twist here is the guy's \"test,\" which is a bit manipulative. He didn't clearly communicate his intentions, leading the author to make decisions based on what he told her.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't obligated to stay loyal after a breakup, especially if the other person didn't confirm they were done. The guy's anger stems from his own hidden motives, not from the author acting in bad faith. So, unless there were clear boundaries set before the breakup, the author didn't do anything wrong. The real issue might be the guy's deceptive behavior in creating the test without being honest about his feelings and expectations.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup he declared, and the test was his own manipulation. She had no reason to know it wasn't a real breakup, so her actions were reasonable.\n"
