TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship with a guy. He ended things, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken and trying to rebuild self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. Later, it turns out the guy's breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. He got angry when she told him about sleeping with others and blocked her. Now the author is wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the ambiguity of the breakup. The guy didn't clearly end the relationship but instead used a \"breakup test\" to see her reaction. However, from the author's perspective, she thought it was a real breakup. She acted on that assumption by moving on, which she felt was justified since they weren't together anymore.\n\nBut wait, the guy's friend later said the breakup was a test. So, if the author was under the impression that they were broken up, then sleeping with others while they were supposedly not in a relationship isn't cheating. Cheating typically involves a commitment to be faithful, which in this case, the guy had already broken by initiating the breakup. However, the guy's actions complicate things. If his \"breakup\" was a form of emotional manipulation to test her loyalty, then maybe he's not in the right position to get angry. But from a traditional standpoint, if the breakup was real, then the author had every right to move on.\n\nBut here's the twist: if the guy's intention was to test her loyalty without ever intending to end the relationship, then he created a situation where he expected her to stay faithful even though he didn't communicate that clearly. That's a bit of a gray area. The author acted on the information she had at the time, which was that they were broken up. If the guy didn't make it clear that the breakup was fake, then she wasn't at fault for moving on. However, if he had some unspoken rules or expectations, maybe there's a case for her being wrong. But in most relationships, if you break up, the other person is free to date others unless there's an explicit agreement otherwise. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional manipulation aspect. By pretending to break up to test her, the guy created a scenario where he's now upset because she didn't play along with his test. That's a bit manipulative. The author had no way of knowing it was a test, so she acted in good faith. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for moving on after a breakup. The real issue is the guy's lack of communication and his manipulative behavior. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author thought they were broken up, moved on, and did what she felt was right under the circumstances. The guy's actions were problematic because he used a fake breakup to test her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
