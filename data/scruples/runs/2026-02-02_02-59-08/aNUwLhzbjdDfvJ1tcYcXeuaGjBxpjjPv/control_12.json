TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, which people might be familiar with. The key points are that the guy broke up with the author, she started dating others, and then he got upset because he was using the breakup as a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author believed they were broken up, so she moved on by seeing others. That seems reasonable because if someone ends a relationship, the expectation is usually to be single until reconciling. However, the guy later claims the breakup was a test and that he was still in love, so he expected her to stay faithful even though they weren't in a relationship anymore. That's a bit confusing. \n\nFrom a typical standpoint, once a relationship ends, unless there's an explicit agreement to stay exclusive (like a \"break\" where you're not dating others), people usually assume they're free to move on. The guy's actions here are a bit manipulative. He ended the relationship, which caused the author emotional pain, and then used that as a test. If he was still in love, why end it in the first place? That seems contradictory. \n\nThe author's decision to date others after a breakup is understandable as a way to heal. The problem comes from the guy's false premise of the breakup. If he had communicated his intentions as a test, maybe she would have handled it differently. But since he didn't, she wasn't in the wrong for assuming they were done. \n\nAlso, the guy's anger for her moving on when he didn't clarify the situation makes me think he's the one with issues here. It's unfair to expect loyalty after a breakup without being honest about his true intentions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions and lack of clear communication are the main issues. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
