TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup, moving on, and then getting angry when the ex found out about new relationships. \n\nFirst, the guy broke up with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others to boost self-esteem. Then the guy revealed he broke up as a test to see if she'd stay loyal. He's angry now because she moved on.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. Legally and socially, once a relationship is over, each person is free to date others. The guy's test was a manipulative move. The author acted on her feelings after the breakup. The problem is that the breakup wasn't genuine, but the author had no way of knowing that at the time. \n\nBut wait, the guy was adamant about being friends, so the author had reason to believe it was over. Sleeping with others after a breakup is a common way to move on. The guy's anger might stem from his test backfiring, which is his own fault for not being honest. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have waited or communicated more. But given the breakup was declared, the author isn't obligated. The guy's actions were deceptive. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
