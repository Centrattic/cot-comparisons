TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the story is asking if they're in the wrong after sleeping with others after a breakup, only to find out their ex was testing their loyalty.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy ended the relationship, said they should just be friends, and the woman moved on by dating others. She thought they were broken up, so she didn't feel obligated to stay faithful. Then she found out he broke up with her as a test to see if she'd stay loyal. He's angry now because she slept with others while \"broken up,\" even though they weren't officially dating anymore.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she was in the wrong. The guy's actions are a bit shady. Ending a relationship is supposed to be final, but he used it as a test. That's manipulative. However, from her perspective, she believed they were over. She didn't know it was a test. She acted based on the information she had. \n\nIn terms of fidelity, once a relationship is officially over, people often move on. But this situation is tricky because he didn't actually end the relationship in a legitimate way. He used a breakup as a test, which isn't a genuine breakup. That makes his behavior problematic. \n\nBut the question is about her. Did she do something wrong? If they were truly broken up, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, if the breakup wasn't real and he was still emotionally involved, maybe she should have checked if it was over. But she had no reason to believe it wasn't a real breakup. He was adamant about just being friends. \n\nThe community might argue that she shouldn't have slept with others too quickly, but that's more about personal timing and healing, not about being in the wrong. The guy's manipulation is the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she acted based on the belief that they were broken up. The fault lies more with the guy for using a breakup as a test and not being honest about his intentions.\n"
