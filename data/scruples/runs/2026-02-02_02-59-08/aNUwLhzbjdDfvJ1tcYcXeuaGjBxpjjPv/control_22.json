TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and to boost their self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. Then the guy said the break-up was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and now he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points here are the nature of the break-up and the expectations each party had. The guy said it was over, and they were supposed to be friends. The author, believing it was a real break-up, moved on by dating others, which is generally acceptable after a breakup. However, the guy later admitted it was a test to see if the author would wait for him, which is a bit manipulative.\n\nThe author didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on what they were told. Cheating is typically wrong if you're in a relationship, but here the relationship was supposedly over. So the author might not be in the wrong because they followed the guy's request to just be friends. The guy's actions, using a fake break-up as a test, seem manipulative and controlling. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have known there was a possibility of the break-up being a test, but that's a stretch. The author acted in good faith based on the information given. The real issue is the guy's manipulation and lack of transparency. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
