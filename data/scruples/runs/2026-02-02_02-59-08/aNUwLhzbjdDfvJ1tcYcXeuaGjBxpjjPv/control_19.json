TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, she started seeing others, and then he was upset because he said the breakup was a test. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the breakup was legitimate or not. The guy said he broke up because he wanted to be just friends, but later his friend says it was a test to see what she would do. That seems a bit manipulative. If he was still in love and testing her, maybe he didn't actually end the relationship. But from her perspective, she thought it was a breakup. She got on Tinder after he said they should be friends, thinking she wasn't obligated anymore. \n\nSo, the key points are whether the breakup was real and if she had a right to move on. If he intended to test her loyalty without clearly stating that he wasn't ending the relationship, that's on him. But she acted based on his initial breakup. If the breakup wasn't real, then maybe she was in the wrong. But how could she know it was a test? He didn't communicate that. \n\nAlso, the guy being angry because she moved on after he broke up with her seems a bit contradictory. If he wanted to be friends and then test her, he's the one who initiated the breakup. She was trying to recover her self-esteem, which is understandable. But maybe he expected her to wait, which isn't fair unless there was some agreement. \n\nI think the main issue here is his lack of clear communication. He broke up with her, then later it's a test. That's manipulative. So she's not in the wrong because she acted based on his initial decision to end the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
