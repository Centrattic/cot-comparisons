TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question was in a relationship where they were head over heels, but their partner didn't reciprocate the same level of feelings. The partner decided to break up and wanted to be friends. The author, hurt and trying to rebuild self-esteem, started using Tinder and slept with others because they thought the relationship was over. Now, the ex claims the breakup was a test and is upset about the author's actions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. The key points to consider are the definitions of a breakup and the expectations of fidelity when a relationship is said to be over. If the partner explicitly ended the relationship, then the author's decision to move on by dating others isn't inherently wrong. However, the complication here is that the ex considered it a test. That adds a layer of manipulation or deceit from the ex's side, which might shift some responsibility there.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, they were told the relationship was over, and they acted accordingly. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating unless there's an agreement to stay exclusive even after the breakup. The author didn't have that agreement, so they acted based on the information they had. The ex's anger stems from the fact that the breakup wasn't real, but the author couldn't have known that. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have maintained some boundaries or communicated better. But realistically, if someone breaks up with you and you're not in a committed friendship with exclusivity, it's reasonable to seek new relationships. The ex's actions were deceptive, which is problematic, but the author's actions were a response to what they believed was the end of the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The ex's deception is a bigger issue here. The author acted on the information they were given. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
