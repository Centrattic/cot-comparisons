TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after sleeping with others following what they thought was a breakup, only to find out the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, the author believed the relationship had ended. When someone ends a relationship, even if there's a hint of lingering feelings, the expectation is usually that the relationship is over. So from the author's perspective, being single and moving on by dating others isn't inherently wrong. People often use dating apps after a breakup to regain confidence, and that's a common coping mechanism.\n\nHowever, the twist here is that the ex didn't actually break up; he was testing the author. He later got upset when the author moved on. The key point is consent and mutual understanding. If the breakup was real, the author had every right to date others. But if the breakup was a test, then the ex didn't communicate his intentions clearly, which is a problem. The author couldn't have known it was a test, so acting on the assumption that the relationship was over is reasonable.\n\nThe ex's anger seems to stem from the author not staying \"faithful\" during a supposed test. But if he didn't clearly state his intentions and then ended the relationship, it's his fault for not being transparent. The author isn't at fault for moving on after a breakup, especially when the other person didn't give clear communication about wanting to continue a relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had. The ex's actions and lack of clear communication are the root of the problem here.\n"
