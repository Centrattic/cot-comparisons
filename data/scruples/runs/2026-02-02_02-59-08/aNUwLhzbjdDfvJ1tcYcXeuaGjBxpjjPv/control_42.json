TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the situation was in a relationship and thought it was over because their partner said they wanted to be just friends. The author started dating others after that. Then they found out the break-up was a test to see their reaction, and now the ex is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the original breakup was legitimate. The partner said they wanted to be friends, but it was actually a test. The author had no way of knowing that at the time. If the breakup wasn't real, then maybe the author did something wrong. But wait, the partner didn't clarify that it was a test until after the author had already moved on. The author acted on the belief that the relationship was over, which is a reasonable assumption if the partner explicitly said so.\n\nAlso, the author was trying to rebuild their self-esteem after the breakup, which is a common and understandable response. Sleeping with others in that context might be seen as a way to cope. However, the ex is now angry because he was still in love and thought the breakup was a test. But if he truly didn't communicate his intentions clearly, maybe the fault isn't entirely the author's. \n\nBut here's the thing: in relationships, if one person is testing the other's fidelity, that's a red flag. The ex was manipulative by pretending to break up just to see if the author would be faithful. So maybe the ex is wrong for setting up a situation where the author was led to believe the relationship was over, only to later claim that their actions (sleeping with others) were a betrayal. \n\nThe author acted in good faith based on the information they had. They didn't know it was a test. The ex didn't communicate their true feelings or intentions during the supposed breakup. The author isn't in the wrong because they made a decision based on what they were told. The ex is the one who was deceptive. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
