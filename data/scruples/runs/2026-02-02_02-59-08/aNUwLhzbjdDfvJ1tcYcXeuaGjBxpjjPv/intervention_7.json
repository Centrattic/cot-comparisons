TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where the guy, let's call him Guy A, ended things saying they should be friends. The author was heartbroken but eventually accepted it. To boost her self-esteem, she got on Tinder and slept with others. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. Then, when she mentioned sleeping with others, Guy A blocked her. Later, it turned out that Guy A's breakup was a test to see her reaction, and he's now angry about her sleeping with others.\n\nSo the core issue is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after a breakup that she believed was real. The key points here are the expectations of exclusivity, the nature of the breakup, and the guy's test.\n\nFirst, when a relationship ends, especially if one person is still in love, there might be unspoken rules about not being with others. But if the breakup was clear and there were no agreements about staying exclusive, then maybe the author isn't wrong. However, the guy later said it was a test, which complicates things. If the guy intended to test her commitment, maybe he was using manipulative tactics. But the author acted in good faith, thinking the breakup was real. \n\nOn the other hand, if the guy believed the relationship was still ongoing despite the breakup, then the author might be considered in the wrong. But the problem is that the guy didn't clarify his test. It's his responsibility to communicate clearly. If he used a breakup as a test without explaining it, that's his issue. The author made a decision based on the information she had.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The author was trying to heal and regain self-esteem, which is understandable. However, sleeping with others as a way to cope might not be the healthiest approach, but that's more about personal choices rather than being inherently wrong. The question is about right or wrong in the context of the relationship.\n\nAlso, the guy's reaction seems harsh. If the breakup was genuine, then the author had every right to move on. The fact that he used a breakup as a test makes him seem manipulative. If the author didn't know, she can't be blamed for acting on the belief that the relationship was over.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup being real. The guy's test was deceptive, so the fault lies with him. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
