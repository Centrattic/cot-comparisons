TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's analyze this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends but presented as real.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but the guy never reciprocated the same feelings. He broke up, saying it would be better as friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others to boost their self-esteem, assuming the relationship was over. However, the guy later revealed that his breakup was a test to see how the author would react. He was still in love and didn't want to be just friends. Now he's angry about the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the author believed the relationship was over. They were told to be friends, and the guy was adamant. So from the author's perspective, they were single and free to date others. The act of sleeping with others was based on the assumption that the relationship had ended. The guy's test was a manipulation tactic, which isn't fair. He didn't communicate his true feelings and instead used a breakup as a test. The author isn't at fault for moving on after a breakup they thought was real. The issue lies with the guy's dishonesty and the test. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the information they had.\n"
