TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The situation is that the person had a relationship and thought the guy broke up with her. She got over it by sleeping with others, but he later said the breakup was a test. Now he's mad.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: Did the breakup actually happen? If the guy intended to test her, did he have the right to do that? And if the breakup wasn't real, was the author in the wrong for moving on?\n\nFirst, the author believed they were broken up. The guy said it was a test but didn't make that clear. If he didn't communicate properly, then maybe the blame isn't entirely on her. But if he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, that's manipulative. \n\nShe started dating others after the breakup, which is common. If they were truly not a couple anymore, then she's not cheating. But he expected her to be faithful during a fake breakup? That's a bit unfair. However, if he was still considering them a couple even after the breakup, then she might be in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, the guy's friend said he was in love and wanted to test her. That sounds like he didn't communicate his intentions properly. If he was testing, he's being manipulative. The author acted based on the belief they were broken up. So maybe she's not wrong for moving on. However, if the breakup wasn't real, then she did sleep with others while still in a de facto relationship. But the guy didn't make that clear.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Depending on the context, the author might not be wrong because she was led to believe it was over. But if the guy was still in love and testing her, that's his fault for not being honest. However, sleeping with others after a breakup is common and not wrong if the breakup is real. Since he claimed the breakup was a test, maybe she's in the right. But if the test was part of their relationship, then she might be in the wrong for not honoring his feelings. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is communication. If the guy didn't make it clear that the breakup was a test, then the author's actions are understandable. But if he expected her to stay faithful without clarifying their status, maybe he's the one at fault. However, the author didn't know, so she might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
