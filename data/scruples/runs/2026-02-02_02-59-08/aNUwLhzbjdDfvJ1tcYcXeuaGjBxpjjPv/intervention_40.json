TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, where Ross \"breaks up\" with Rachel, and she ends up with someone else, leading to conflict.\n\nSo the person in question was in a relationship, then the guy decided to break up, claiming he wanted to be friends. The author was heartbroken but tried to move on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. Now, the guy is upset because he says the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay loyal, and he's blocked her, angry about her actions.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points here are whether the breakup was legitimate or not. The guy said it was a breakup, and the author assumed they were over. If the breakup was genuine, then the author isn't in the wrong for moving on. But if it was a test, as he later claimed, then maybe the author was wrong for sleeping with others because they were still in a relationship in his eyes.\n\nBut wait, the author thought they were broken up. If the guy didn't clarify that it wasn't a real breakup until after the fact, then the author had no way of knowing. In that case, she acted based on his initial statement. However, if the guy's intention was to test her loyalty, then he didn't communicate that properly. The author can't be blamed for acting on the information given. But she might be at fault if she didn't confirm the status of their relationship before moving on. But given that he said they were broken up and advised to be friends, she had reason to believe the relationship was over.\n\nOn the other hand, if the guy was still in love and the breakup was a test, then maybe he did wrong by not being honest. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since she believed they were not in a relationship anymore, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong if the relationship is truly over. However, the guy's perspective complicates things. But unless they had a prior agreement about exclusivity even after a breakup, which isn't common, the author wasn't obligated to stay celibate.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author acted based on the information she had. The guy's test was deceptive, and she wasn't in the wrong for moving on once they were supposedly just friends.\n"
