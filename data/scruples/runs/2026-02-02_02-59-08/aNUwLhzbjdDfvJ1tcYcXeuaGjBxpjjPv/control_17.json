TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy in the story was in a relationship and the other person broke up with him, saying they wanted to be just friends. The author here is the one who was broken up with, right? Wait, no. Wait, let me check again. The person writing is the one who was in a relationship with a guy who broke up with her. He said it's better to be friends, and she was heartbroken. Then she started using Tinder and sleeping with others because she thought they were no longer a couple. But then the guy claims that breaking up was a test to see what she would do, and he's upset that she slept with others. Now he's blocked her and refuses to talk.\n\nSo the question is, was the author in the wrong for sleeping with others after the breakup, assuming it was real?\n\nHmm. Well, if the breakup was real and they were no longer in a relationship, then technically the author isn't cheating. The guy said they should be friends, so maybe she thought it was okay to move on. But then he later says it was a test, implying he never intended to end the relationship. That complicates things. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author was wrong. If he actually broke up with her, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, if he was lying about the breakup and it was a test, then maybe she had a reason to believe the breakup was real. But the problem is that he didn't clarify his intentions. He told her to be friends, and she moved on. He then gets mad because he was using the breakup as a test. \n\nIn relationships, if one person breaks up, the other is free to move on. The issue here is that he didn't communicate his true feelings. She thought the relationship was over, so she wasn't in the wrong for moving on. But if he never intended to end the relationship and just wanted to test her, maybe there's some ambiguity. However, she had no way of knowing that. She acted based on his initial statement. \n\nSo, in terms of accountability, maybe the blame isn't entirely on her. She thought the breakup was real. He didn't clarify. His reaction seems hypocritical because he manipulated the situation by making her think it was over, then getting angry when she moved on. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted based on the information given to her, which was that they were no longer a couple. His test was deceptive, and she had no way of knowing his real intentions. So she's not at fault for sleeping with others after a breakup that he initially declared.\n"
