TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is that the author's partner ended the relationship, saying they wanted to be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. Then they found out that the partner's breakup was actually a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and now the partner is upset and blocked them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author believed the relationship was over after the partner said they wanted to be friends. The partner didn't clarify that it was a test. The author acted on their assumption that they were no longer in a relationship, so they started seeing others. However, the partner had ulterior motives and later claims that the breakup wasn't real.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had every reason to believe the relationship had ended. If someone ends a relationship, even if it's a test, the other person isn't obligated to stay single. The author's actions were based on the information they had. The partner's test was manipulative because they didn't communicate their true feelings or intentions. The author didn't know it was a test, so they couldn't have known they should stay faithful. \n\nBut then again, if the partner was still in love and wanted to test the author's commitment, maybe there's some fault there. However, the partner's actions (ending the relationship) set the stage for the author's response. The author isn't in the wrong for moving on after a breakup. The real issue is the partner's dishonesty and manipulative behavior. The author had no way of knowing it was a test, so they acted in good faith. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they didn't know the breakup was a test and acted based on the information they had. The partner's actions were deceptive.\n"
