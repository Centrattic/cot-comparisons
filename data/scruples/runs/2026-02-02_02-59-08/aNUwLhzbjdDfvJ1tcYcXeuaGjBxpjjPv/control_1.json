TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where Ross declares a break-up as a test. \n\nFirst, the guy says he wants to be friends after breaking up. The author, thinking it's over, starts dating others to boost her self-esteem. Then he reveals it was a test and is upset she moved on.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's at fault. The key points are: Did he actually break up with her, or was it a test? If he said they were breaking up and the author believed him, then she's not in the wrong. The guy's actions of making a fake break-up as a test could be the issue here. But if the author acted on the assumption that the relationship was over, then she might be justified.\n\nThe user is asking for an answer A or B. A is yes, she's wrong; B is no. Let me think. The guy didn't clarify that it was a test. He told her they should be friends, which is a break-up. She acted on that. So he's the one who's being manipulative. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
