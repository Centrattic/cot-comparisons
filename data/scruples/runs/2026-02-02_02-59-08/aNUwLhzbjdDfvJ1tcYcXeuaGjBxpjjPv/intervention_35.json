TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy initially broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She thought it was a real breakup, so she started seeing others on Tinder. But then he told his friend that the breakup was a test to see what she would do, and now he's angry because she slept with other people. \n\nFirst, the key points here are the nature of the breakup and the guy's intentions. If he genuinely broke up with her and there was no ambiguity, then she wasn't in a relationship anymore and sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. However, if the breakup was a test and he never actually ended the relationship, that's a different scenario. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, she believed they were no longer in a relationship. She acted based on that belief. The problem here is the guy's actions. If he broke up with her and then later claims it was a test, that seems manipulative. He set her up to fail by creating a fake breakup scenario, which is unfair. \n\nBut then, when she moved on, he got upset. So, who's at fault? If the breakup was real, she's not in the wrong. But if he never really ended the relationship, then she was wrong to sleep with others. However, the guy's behavior is questionable because he didn't communicate clearly. He pretended to break up, which is deceptive. \n\nThe author's actions were based on the understanding that the relationship was over. She took steps to move on, which is a natural response. The fact that he was testing her loyalty without being honest complicates things. In a healthy relationship, both parties should communicate openly. If he intended to test her, that's a red flag for manipulation. \n\nSo, considering that she acted in good faith based on his initial breakup, and he later revealed a hidden agenda, she might not be entirely in the wrong. However, some might argue that a breakup, even if it's a test, is a breakup in the moment, and moving on is reasonable. But the guy's test was unethical because it's a manipulation tactic. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily at fault here.\n"
