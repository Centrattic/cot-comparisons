TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-partner broke up with them, leading the author to sleep with others to boost their self-esteem. The ex then claims the breakup was a test and is now angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship status. The guy said it was a breakup, so from the author's perspective, they were no longer in a relationship. Sleeping with others when you're single is generally not considered cheating. However, the twist is that the ex's friend revealed the breakup was a test. If the author believed they were single, then sleeping with others might be justified. But if the ex didn't actually end the relationship and was testing the author's loyalty, then the author might have made a mistake by sleeping with others while still in a committed relationship without clear boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the ex claimed they were just friends after the breakup. The author assumed the relationship was over. If the ex later admits the breakup was a test, that suggests the ex was still in the relationship in some form, which is confusing. The key here is the communication. If the author was led to believe the relationship was over, then they couldn't be expected to know it was a test. The ex's actions (blocking and getting angry) suggest they wanted to maintain some form of control or test the author's loyalty without clear communication.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. However, if the ex didn't communicate their intentions clearly, the author might not be at fault for acting on the information they were given. The author had the right to seek emotional and physical closure after a breakup. The ex's test is a red flag, as it's manipulative and lacks transparency. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the breakup as communicated to them.\n"
