TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The key points here are the breakup, the author's actions of seeing new people, and the revelation that the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, the guy decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. The author accepted that and moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. They thought it was okay because they were no longer in a relationship. Now, the guy says the breakup was a test to see if the author was faithful, and he's upset because she wasn't.\n\nSo, from my understanding, the author believed the relationship was over. If that's the case, then she's not in the wrong for moving on. The issue here is that the guy didn't communicate his true intentions. He claimed to have broken up but was actually testing her loyalty without her knowledge. That's a bit manipulative because he's using a breakup as a test. \n\nThe author had no way of knowing it wasn't a real breakup. She acted based on his statement and carried on being friends. When he asked her to be friends, she complied, and then he went back on his word. His anger seems misplaced because he didn't have the right to expect her to stay faithful after a breakup, especially since he didn't clarify his intentions. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the guy's actions are more questionable here. He set up a scenario where he could judge the author's response, but he didn't have the right to do so without her consent. The author acted within the boundaries she believed existed. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
