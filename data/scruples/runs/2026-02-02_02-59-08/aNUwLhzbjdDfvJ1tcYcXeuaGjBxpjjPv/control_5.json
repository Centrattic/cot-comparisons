TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, where Ross breaks up with Rachel, then later says it was a mistake.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate the same way. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. After some time, she started dating others to boost her self-esteem. Then, when she mentioned sleeping with others, he blocked her. It turns out he broke up with her as a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and now he's angry.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation to stay faithful once a relationship is over. However, ethically or emotionally, it's more complicated. The guy said they were broken up, so from her perspective, she wasn't cheating. But he considered it a test, meaning he never intended to actually break up. This creates a situation where there was a misunderstanding about the relationship's status. \n\nThe author believed the break-up was real, so acting on that belief by moving on might be seen as justified. However, if the break-up was a test, then maybe there was deception on his part. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not the guy. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often frown upon getting intimate with others immediately after a breakup, but if the relationship was truly over, it's not technically cheating. The problem arises if the break-up wasn't genuine. However, the author had no way of knowing it was a test. \n\nSo, the author acted based on the information they had. If the guy was deceptive, then the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. But if the author should have known the relationship wasn't over, maybe they are at fault. However, the guy was adamant about being just friends, and the author moved on. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they followed the guy's initial decision to break up. The issue stems from the guy's deception. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
