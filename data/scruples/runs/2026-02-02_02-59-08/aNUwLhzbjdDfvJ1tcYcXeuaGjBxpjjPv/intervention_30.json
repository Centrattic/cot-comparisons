TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, she started dating others, and he was upset because he later admitted it was a test to see her reaction.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She thought the breakup was real. If it was a mutual agreement or he clearly stated it was over, then she's not in the wrong for moving on. However, if he never actually ended the relationship and just said it to test her, then the break up might not have been legitimate. But from her description, he claimed they should be friends, and she accepted that. So she might have believed it was over.\n\nHer actions: She used Tinder and slept with others after the breakup. She felt it was okay because she thought they were no longer a couple. But if the breakup wasn't real, then technically she was cheating. However, she didn't know it was a test. So the key point is whether the break up was genuine. If he lied about ending the relationship, then she's not at fault. But if he did actually end it (even if with intent to test later), she might be in the wrong because she shouldn't have assumed anything was wrong and moved on. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the break up was a test and the relationship was still ongoing, then she was technically cheating. However, she had no way of knowing that. The problem arises from his ambiguous behavior. He broke up with her, making her believe the relationship was over, but then later claims it wasn't. It's his responsibility to communicate clearly. If he didn't make it clear that the break up was a test, then the blame isn't entirely on her. \n\nIn relationships, both parties have responsibilities. He manipulated the situation by not being honest. She acted based on the information she had. So maybe the fault isn't entirely hers. However, if she had any doubts about the break up being real, maybe she should have questioned him instead of moving on. But he was adamant about being friends, so she had every reason to believe it was over. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong because she acted on the breakup being real. The real issue is his dishonesty. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
