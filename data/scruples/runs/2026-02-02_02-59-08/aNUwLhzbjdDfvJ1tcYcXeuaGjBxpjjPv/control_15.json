TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated because it's similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, which is a classic example of on-again, off-again relationship confusion. \n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy (let's call him G) never made his feelings as clear. He ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with other people after the breakup. Now, G is angry because he claims the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful, and he's upset that she didn't.\n\nSo, the main question is: was the author wrong to sleep with others after the breakup? Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Communication and Clarity**: The key issue here is whether the breakup was genuine. If G ended the relationship definitively, then the author's actions after that might be seen as her own way to move on. However, if G's breakup was a test and he never communicated that clearly, then the author might not be at fault because she had no way of knowing it was a test. But the problem is that G didn't clarify his intentions. In a healthy relationship, a breakup should be clear. If someone is testing their partner's loyalty without clear communication, that's a problem.\n\n2. **Boundaries and Trust**: After a breakup, even if someone is still in love, sleeping with others is a personal choice. If the relationship was over and G had said they were just friends, then the author isn't obligated to stay monogamous unless there were specific agreements. But if G intended it as a test, that's a breach of trust because he didn't set clear boundaries. The author acted based on the information she had, which was that the relationship was over.\n\n3. **Emotional Manipulation**: If G pretended to break up to test the author's loyalty, that's a form of manipulation. People often do this to see if their partner will stay faithful, but it's not fair or honest. The author had no reason to stay faithful if the relationship was truly over. His anger might stem from his own manipulative actions rather than the author's response.\n\n4. **Responsibility and Accountability**: The author is taking responsibility for her actions by using Tinder to boost her self-esteem. However, if the breakup was a test, then G is the one who created the confusion. The author's actions are a natural response to a breakup, and it's unfair to blame her for acting on her feelings when the other person was being dishonest about their intentions.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: In relationships, honesty is crucial. If G didn't communicate his true intentions, he's at fault for creating a situation where the author was led to believe the relationship was over. The author, acting on that belief, isn't in the wrong. The real issue is G's dishonesty and manipulation.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup she was told about. The fault lies with G for not being honest about his intentions and using a fake breakup as a test. The author had no way of knowing it wasn't a real breakup, so her actions are understandable given the information she had.\n"
