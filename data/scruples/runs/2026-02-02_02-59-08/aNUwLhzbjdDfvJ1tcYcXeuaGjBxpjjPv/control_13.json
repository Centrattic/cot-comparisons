TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is a breakup where the guy said they should be friends, and the girl started dating others. Now he's angry because he says breaking up was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She thought it was over, so she used Tinder and slept with others to help her get over it. But he later says the breakup was a test to see what she would do, and he's mad she moved on.\n\nThe question is about whether the author (the girl) is wrong. From a typical perspective, if someone breaks up with you, you're no longer in a relationship, so seeing other people isn't cheating. However, if there were unspoken expectations or if he didn't truly break up, maybe there's an issue. But according to what's written, he was adamant they were just friends. The problem here is his own actions\u2014he used a fake breakup as a test, which is manipulative. The girl acted on the assumption that the relationship was over. So she's not in the wrong because she followed what he told her. His anger stems from his own deceptive behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
