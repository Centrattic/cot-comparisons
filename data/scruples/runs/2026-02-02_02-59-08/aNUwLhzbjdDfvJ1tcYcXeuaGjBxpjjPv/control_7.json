TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, where a break-up leads to confusion and mixed signals.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was in a relationship that the guy ended, saying they should be friends. The author then moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. The guy later admits he broke up with her as a test to see what she would do, and now he's angry she moved on. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the break-up. From the author's perspective, she thought they were broken up, so she felt free to date others. But the guy claims it was a test and he still loved her, so he's upset.\n\nLegally, if a relationship ends, there's no obligation to remain exclusive. So the author isn't cheating if they're not in a relationship. However, emotionally, there might be unspoken expectations, especially if the break-up was acrimonious or if there were mixed signals. But in this case, the guy initiated the break-up and said they should be friends, which the author took as the end of the relationship.\n\nThe twist is that the guy's break-up was a test. That's a bit manipulative. He pretended to break up to see if she would stay loyal. If he didn't communicate his intentions clearly, then he's at fault for the confusion. The author acted based on what he told her, so she had a reasonable belief that the relationship was over. Sleeping with others after a break-up is common and a personal choice, especially if one is trying to move on.\n\nHowever, the fact that she's still in love with him and he's now upset might complicate things, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. The main issue is whether the break-up was genuine. If the guy lied about breaking up, then he's the one in the wrong. The author acted based on his statement, so she isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
