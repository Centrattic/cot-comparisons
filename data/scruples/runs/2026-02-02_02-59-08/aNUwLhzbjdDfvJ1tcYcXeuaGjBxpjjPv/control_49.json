TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to Ross and Rachel, which I know is a famous TV show scenario where Ross and Rachel keep breaking up and getting back together, often with Ross being the one to break up and then regret it.\n\nIn the given scenario, the guy breaks up with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, starts using Tinder and sleeps with others to boost her self-esteem. Later, she finds out that the break-up was a test because he was still in love with her. Now he's angry because she slept with others after the break-up, which she thought was official.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was in a relationship when she started seeing other people. The key point here is the status of their relationship after the break-up. If the guy initiated the break-up and made it clear they were just friends, then the author isn't in a relationship anymore. Therefore, sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. However, if the break-up wasn't official or there was ambiguity, maybe she was still in the relationship.\n\nIn the story, the guy claims the break-up was a test. But at the time, he told her it was over and they should be friends. The author believed it was a real break-up. The problem arises from the guy's intention being a test, which he didn't communicate. So, from the author's perspective, she thought the relationship was over, so she wasn't in the wrong for moving on. However, the guy's actions (testing her) might be questionable. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the break-up was real, then she's not in the wrong. If he didn't actually break up with her but was testing her, then technically she was still in a relationship when she slept with others. However, since he didn't communicate that it was a test, the author had no way of knowing. So it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn most cases, if someone initiates a break-up and says they want to be friends, the other person isn't obligated to stay faithful. The fact that he later claims it was a test doesn't retroactively make her actions wrong if she believed it was a real break-up. The responsibility here might lie with him for not being clear. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
