TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy \"broke up\" with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and wanting to boost self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with a few people. Then, the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay loyal, and he's now angry that she slept with others. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship because the guy said it was better to be friends. If that was a genuine breakup, then the author isn't cheating because they're not exclusive anymore. However, if the guy never actually ended the relationship and that \"breakup\" was a test, then maybe the author was still in a relationship and thus sleeping with others would be cheating. \n\nBut the problem is that the guy didn't clarify this. He said they were breaking up, so the author had every reason to believe the relationship was over. The author's actions were based on that assumption. The guy later admitted it was a test, which is a bit manipulative. Testing your partner in this way without being honest could be problematic. \n\nIn most relationships, if one person says they want to break up, the other is expected to accept that the relationship is over. The fact that the guy was using her reaction as a test without being upfront about his intentions might mean he's at fault here. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. She wasn't aware of the test, so she couldn't have known she was still in the relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the guy never actually ended the relationship, then the author was still in a committed relationship and sleeping with others would be a betrayal. But the key point is that the guy claimed to break up, so the author had no reason to believe that. It's the guy's responsibility to communicate clearly. If he's using a breakup as a test, that's not a real breakup, and the author shouldn't be expected to know the rules were different.\n\nAnother angle: Emotional manipulation. Using a breakup as a test to see if the partner stays faithful is a form of manipulation. The guy might have set up a scenario where he could feel justified in his feelings without being honest. That's not healthy. The author acted in good faith based on what he told her. \n\nIn conclusion, since the author believed the relationship was over and acted accordingly, she's not in the wrong. The fault lies with the guy for not being honest from the start and manipulating the situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
