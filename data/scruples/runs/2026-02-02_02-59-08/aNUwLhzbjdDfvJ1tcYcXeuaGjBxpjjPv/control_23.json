TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends. The author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then got on Tinder and slept with other people to boost her self-esteem. Later, she found out that the guy's breakup was a test to see if she would stay faithful, and he's now angry she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy initiated the breakup but continued talking to her. The author thought they were over, so she started dating others. The twist is the guy's \"test\" was to see if she'd stay loyal. But from the author's perspective, she believed they were no longer a couple. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. If the guy had indeed broken up with her, then she wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. However, if the breakup was a test and he intended to remain in a relationship, then she might be in the wrong. But the problem is that the guy didn't communicate this test clearly. He told her to be friends, which she took as a breakup. \n\nSince the author acted on the information she had, which was a breakup, her actions were based on that belief. The guy's test was a hidden agenda he didn't clarify. From an ethical standpoint, if the breakup was genuine, the author isn't wrong. However, if the guy's intention was to test her, she might not know that. But the guy still had a responsibility to communicate his intentions. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she made a reasonable assumption based on his initial statement. The guy's test was a manipulation tactic, and she wasn't aware of his true intentions. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
