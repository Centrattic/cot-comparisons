TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person broke up with their boyfriend, who claimed he was in love but didn't say it clearly. The boyfriend said they should be friends after the breakup. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to rebuild their self-esteem, started dating others on Tinder. The boyfriend later admitted that the breakup was a test to see how she would react, and now he's upset because she slept with others while they weren't officially together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author thought they were broken up, so she moved on. But if the boyfriend didn't actually end the relationship but was testing her loyalty, that's a problem. However, the author believed they were separated and acted accordingly. The key point here is whether the breakup was genuine or not. If the boyfriend never truly ended the relationship and was just testing her, then technically the author might have been cheating. But from her perspective, she thought they were over.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend did say they were just friends and that he wanted to be friends. The author took that as a breakup, so her assumption was based on his statement. Even if he later claims it was a test, if he didn't clarify that they were still an item in a different way, then the author had reason to believe the relationship was over. In most cases, when someone says they want to be friends after a breakup, that's the end. The boyfriend's actions here are a bit manipulative because he didn't communicate clearly and used a test to see her reaction.\n\nThe author's actions of moving on and dating others after a breakup are typical and not inherently wrong, especially if she believed the relationship was over. The boyfriend's anger stems from his own ambiguous behavior. He didn't set clear boundaries and later judged her for acting on her beliefs about the relationship's status. So the fault might lie more with the boyfriend for not being honest about his intentions.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if there was any possibility the relationship wasn't fully over, the author should have double-checked. But given the information she had, she made a reasonable decision. The boyfriend's \"test\" is problematic because it's manipulative and doesn't give her a fair chance to respond. In relationships, both parties should communicate openly. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup statement. The boyfriend's behavior is more at fault here.\n"
