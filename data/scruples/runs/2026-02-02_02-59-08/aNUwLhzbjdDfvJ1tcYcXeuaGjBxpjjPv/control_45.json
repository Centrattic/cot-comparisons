TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends. The guy broke up with the author, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then starts dating others on Tinder and sleeps with some people. Later, they find out the break-up was a test, and now the guy is angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy initiated the break-up and said they should be friends. The author believed the relationship was over, which is a reasonable assumption. When someone breaks up, the expectation is that the relationship has ended. The author, trying to move on, starts seeing others. That's a common response when someone is heartbroken. \n\nHowever, the twist is that the guy's break-up was a test. But from the author's perspective, they had no way of knowing that. The guy was the one who ended things and said they should be just friends. The author isn't responsible for the guy's hidden motives. \n\nThe key point is consent and mutual understanding. The guy said they were over, so the author acted accordingly. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he was the one who ended the relationship. The author isn't cheating because the relationship was supposedly over. The problem here is the guy's deceptive behavior\u2014using the break-up as a test without being honest. \n\nCheating typically involves infidelity within an ongoing relationship. Since the author thought the relationship was ended, sleeping with others isn't cheating in that context. The guy's anger is based on a premise that the relationship was still ongoing, which it wasn't according to his own statement. The author had no obligation to stay exclusive if the relationship was over. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being honest about his intentions and then holding the author accountable for moving on. The author acted based on the information they had. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
