TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends, which is a classic example of a breakup and reconciliation with emotional complexity.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken, used Tinder and slept with others to boost their self-esteem. The guy later admitted that the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. Now he's upset that she moved on with others and has blocked her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong for sleeping with others after the breakup. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. On one hand, the guy initiated the breakup, leading the author to believe it was over. In that context, she might feel free to date others. However, the guy's friend revealed that the breakup was a test. But the problem here is that the author didn't know that at the time. If the breakup was a test, it's a bit manipulative because the guy never clarified his intentions. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, she acted based on the information she had. She believed it was a breakup, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. However, if the guy was still emotionally invested and considered them to be in a relationship, then her actions might be seen as a betrayal. The ambiguity here is critical. \n\nThe key issue is communication. The guy didn't make his intentions clear. If he wanted to test their relationship, he should have been honest. The author's assumption that it was a breakup is understandable. So while the guy's actions were questionable, the author's actions were based on the breakup. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have asked for clarification before moving on. However, after a breakup, it's common to move on. If the guy was testing her, it's his fault for not being clear. The author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
