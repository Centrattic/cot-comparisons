TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's ex-boyfriend claimed they were just friends after a breakup, and the person started seeing others. Then the ex friend got upset when they found out, because he had actually broken up as a test to see if the person would stay loyal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The user thought they were broken up and thus had no obligation to stay faithful. But the ex didn't actually end things for good; he was using the breakup as a test. So, the person acted on the assumption that the relationship was over, which might be valid. But maybe there's an emotional aspect here. Even if technically they weren't in a relationship, if the ex was still emotionally attached and saw the breakup as a trial period, maybe there's an unspoken expectation of exclusivity. However, that's not standard. Usually, once a breakup is mutual and both agree to be friends, engaging in new relationships isn't considered cheating unless there's an agreement otherwise. The ex's actions were manipulative, setting a test without the person's knowledge. The person here didn't know the rules were different, so they might not be at fault. On the other hand, maybe they should have considered that the ex might be in love and not taken the breakup at face value. But the ex didn't communicate his intentions. So the fault isn't solely on the person. I think the main issue is the ex's manipulation. The person acted based on the information they had. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
