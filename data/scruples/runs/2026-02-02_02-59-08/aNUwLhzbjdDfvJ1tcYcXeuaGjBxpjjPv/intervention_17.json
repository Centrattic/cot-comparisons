TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then started sleeping with other people to boost her self-esteem, thinking it was okay because they weren't together anymore. But later found out that the breakup was actually a test, and he was still in love. Now he's mad at her because she slept with others during that time.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intentions of both parties. The guy said it was a breakup, but in reality, he was testing her. The author thought they were over and had no obligations. She acted accordingly. However, if the guy never actually wanted to end the relationship and was just testing her loyalty, then maybe she didn't know the true situation. But the problem is that the author believed they were broken up and thought it was okay to move on. \n\nWait, but if he told her to be friends and he was adamant about that, then technically, they were not in a relationship anymore. The author's actions were based on that assumption. However, the fact that he was using a test complicates things. Maybe he didn't communicate his true feelings properly, but the author didn't know that. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, if you're not in a relationship, sleeping with others isn't cheating. The issue is whether the author was aware they were still in a relationship. Since the guy claimed it was a breakup, the author had no way of knowing it was a test. However, the guy's actions of using a test might be manipulative. But the question is about the author's responsibility.\n\nSo, if the author genuinely believed they were over, then technically she's not in the wrong. However, if the man was still in love and the breakup was a test, maybe he should have clarified. But from the author's perspective, she acted based on his stated intention. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have been more cautious and verified if the breakup was genuine. But that's a bit unfair because people can be manipulative. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author had a reasonable belief that the relationship was over. Since the guy was adamant about wanting to be friends, the author's assumption was based on his words. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that the man's test was a trick, but she had no way of knowing. So the responsibility lies with him for not being clear. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
