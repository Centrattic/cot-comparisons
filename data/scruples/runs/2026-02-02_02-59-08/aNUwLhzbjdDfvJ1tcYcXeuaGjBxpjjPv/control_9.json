TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy in the relationship decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. The author was hurt but eventually accepted it. Then, to boost self-esteem, the author started using Tinder and slept with others. They assumed they were no longer in a relationship, so they felt it was okay. However, the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. He was still in love and now is upset about the author's actions.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was in the wrong. The key points are: 1) Did the author have a valid reason to believe the relationship was over? 2) Was the guy's test a legitimate reason to expect the author to stay celibate?\n\nThe guy's action of breaking up and then later revealing it was a test is a bit manipulative. If he truly ended the relationship, then the author's actions aren't wrong because they were acting on the assumption that they weren't together anymore. However, if he never intended to end the relationship and was just testing the author, that's his own deception. But the author can't be expected to know that unless there were clear signs. The problem is that the guy didn't communicate his intentions properly. He told the author to be friends, which led the author to move on. The author's actions were based on the information given at the time. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the relationship ended, the author's decision to sleep with others soon after might be seen as moving on quickly, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The moral obligation to remain faithful would only exist if they were still in a relationship. Since the guy claimed it was over, the author isn't bound by those rules anymore. The guy's test is a red flag, though, as it's not a healthy way to handle relationship issues. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted on the breakup being real. The guy's mistake was in his approach, not the author's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
