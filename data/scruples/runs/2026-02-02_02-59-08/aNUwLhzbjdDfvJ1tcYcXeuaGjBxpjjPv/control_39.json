TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be friends. The author then went on Tinder, slept with others, and now the ex is angry because the breakup was actually a test to see what the author would do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author believed the relationship was over, which is a key point. The ex didn't clarify that the breakup was a test until after the author had moved on. The author's actions were based on the assumption that they were no longer in a relationship. In a typical breakup scenario, if one person ends the relationship and is clear, the other is not expected to stay celibate unless there's some explicit agreement. \n\nHowever, the twist here is that the breakup was a test. The ex was still in love and wanted to see how the author would react. But the author had no way of knowing that. The ex was the one who ended things, so the author's response to start dating others isn't inherently wrong. The ex's actions of pretending to break up and then getting upset when the author moved on might be more questionable.\n\nBut there's a nuance. The author and the ex were still talking after the breakup, and the author started seeing others while still emotionally attached. The author might have rushed into new relationships to cope, which could be seen as impulsive. However, the core issue is that the ex manipulated the situation by not being honest about their intentions. The author acted based on the information they had at the time.\n\nIn terms of infidelity, if the breakup was genuine, sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. But since the ex considered it a test, they might view the author's actions as a failure. But from the author's perspective, they were following the breakup as a normal process. The ex's anger stems from their hidden agenda, not the author's actions per se.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup as presented. The fault lies with the ex for not being honest. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
