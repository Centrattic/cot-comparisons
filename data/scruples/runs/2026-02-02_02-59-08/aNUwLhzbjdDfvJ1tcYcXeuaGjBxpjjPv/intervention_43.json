TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, saying they should be friends. She started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. Later, she found out that the guy's breakup was a test because he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction. He got angry when she slept with others and blocked her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy said they were just friends after the breakup, so the author assumed the relationship was over. She then moved on by sleeping with others, which she thought was okay because they weren't dating anymore. However, the guy's intention was to test her loyalty, which was a deception on his part.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she believed the relationship was broken off. In that case, she might not be at fault for moving on. Infidelity typically requires a current relationship where exclusivity is expected. Since the guy ended the relationship, even if it was a test, the author didn't know that. She acted based on the information she had.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's test was manipulative. He broke up with her but kept talking, which could have been confusing. The author's actions were based on his decision to end the relationship. However, sleeping with others immediately after a breakup might be seen as hasty, but morally, if the relationship was genuinely over, she's not in the wrong. The guy's deception complicates things, but the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nIf the breakup was real, then she's not wrong. If the breakup was a test, he's the one who was deceptive. But since he claimed it was a breakup, she made a reasonable assumption. Infidelity usually requires a mutual understanding of the relationship status. Since there was no clear agreement, but he initiated the breakup, she acted within that context. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on his stated decision to end the relationship.\n"
