TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author thought it was a breakup and started dating others on Tinder. Then she found out the guy was using the breakup as a test to see if she was still into him. Now he's mad she slept with others since they were supposedly just friends.\n\nHmm, so first, the main issue is whether the author did something wrong. The key points here are the communication between the two. The guy said they should be friends, but maybe he didn't clearly break up. The author assumed it was a breakup and moved on. But if the guy didn't actually end the relationship, then technically they were still in a relationship, making the author's actions cheating. However, if he did break up, then she's not obligated to be faithful anymore. \n\nBut wait, the guy's friend said the breakup was a test. That's a bit manipulative. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, but didn't clarify the status, then maybe the problem lies with him. The author acted based on the assumption that they were over. However, if there was no clear communication of the breakup, the author might not be entirely wrong. But if the guy considered it a breakup, then she's in the right. But if he didn't actually end the relationship and just wanted to test her, then he's at fault. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for using Tinder to boost her self-esteem after a breakup is understandable, but the problem arises if the guy didn't actually break up. The key here is the ambiguity in their communication. The author thought it was a breakup, but the guy didn't clearly communicate that. So maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. However, in relationships, once someone says they want to be friends, even if it's a test, the other person might act on that. But if there's no clear end to the relationship, then maybe the author's actions were inappropriate. \n\nBut wait, the guy's actions of using a breakup as a test are questionable. He might have known that she would take it seriously, and then he's upset when she moves on. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on his stated intention. The problem is his lack of clear communication. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
