TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given scenario. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy wasn't as committed. He broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but agreed. After some time, she got on Tinder and slept with others to boost her self-esteem, thinking they were no longer a couple. Then, she mentioned this to him, and he blocked her. It turns out he broke up as a test to see her reaction and is now angry she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy ended the relationship, so from the author's perspective, they were no longer an item. She moved on, which is a common way to heal after a breakup. However, the twist is that he considered the breakup a test. That's a bit tricky because typically, a breakup is supposed to be a genuine decision, not a test. If he wasn't clear about his intentions, maybe he's the one in the wrong for manipulating the situation.\n\nThe author's actions were based on his initial decision to end things. If she believed they were no longer together, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. But the problem arises because he didn't communicate his true feelings and intentions. By using a breakup as a test without being upfront, he's being deceptive. The author had no way of knowing he was still interested and considering her his. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the information given. He, on the other hand, is being sneaky by testing her and then getting angry. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
