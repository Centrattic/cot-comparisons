TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author then started seeing other people, thinking they were broken up. Now the guy is upset because he actually was testing their loyalty, and he's mad.\n\nFirst, the key point is whether they were actually in a breakup. The guy said it was a breakup, but his friend later says it was a test. If the breakup was real, then the author isn't cheating. But if it wasn't, then maybe they were. However, the guy never clarified that it wasn't a real breakup. The author acted in good faith based on what he told them. So from the author's perspective, they were no longer in a relationship and thus not in the wrong for moving on. \n\nAlso, the guy's friend admitted he was testing her. That seems manipulative. If he was in love and wanted to test her loyalty without being honest, that's his fault. The author didn't know about the test. So, the author isn't the one in the wrong because they followed the guy's lead and made decisions based on that. The guy's actions were deceptive. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
