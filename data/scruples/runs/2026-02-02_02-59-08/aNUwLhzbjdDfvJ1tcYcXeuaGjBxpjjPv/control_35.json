TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author, heartbroken, starts using Tinder and sleeps with others to boost their self-esteem. But then the guy reveals he was testing their loyalty and is now angry.\n\nFirst, the guy broke up with her, right? If a breakup is genuine, then each person is free to move on. But he claims it was a test to see if she'd be faithful. That's a bit of a problem. People usually don't test others by breaking up. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, maybe he should have communicated that. But he didn't. The author believed they were over, so she acted accordingly. \n\nThe author's actions: she started dating others after the breakup, which she thought was okay since they weren't together. She didn't know he was testing her. So, she made a mistake in assuming he was done, but he had misled her by initiating the breakup. If he was testing, he should have been clearer. But in reality, breakups are final unless otherwise stated. \n\nThe guy's issue is that he wanted to see if she'd be faithful during the breakup period. But that's a bit manipulative. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, he should have been honest about his intentions. The author wasn't in the wrong for moving on after a breakup, unless there were specific agreements in place. Since the guy didn't clarify it was a test, the author had no reason to stay faithful. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions were deceptive. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
