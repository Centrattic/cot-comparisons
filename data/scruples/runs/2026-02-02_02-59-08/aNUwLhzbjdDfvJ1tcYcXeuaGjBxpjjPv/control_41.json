TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. She then started dating others through Tinder and sleeping with people. Now he's angry and blocked her, saying the breakup was a test to see what she would do.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the guy ended the relationship, she moved on by sleeping with others, and now he's upset. But he admitted the breakup was a test, still in love. The question is whether the author did wrong.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, if someone ends a relationship, especially unilaterally without mutual agreement, the other person is within their rights to move on. However, the twist here is that the guy's breakup was a test. If he intended to test her loyalty, then by sleeping with others, she might have failed the test from his perspective. But ethically, can you fault someone for moving on when the other person has already ended the relationship, even if it was a test?\n\nAlso, the guy was adamant about being friends, so she had no obligation to stay celibate. His anger seems to stem from a test he set up but didn't communicate honestly. The problem might be his manipulation rather than her actions. \n\nSo, if he broke up with her and she wasn't in a committed relationship anymore, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. He's the one who initiated the breakup. Even if it was a test, he should have been honest. Her actions were a response to the breakup, which he had already declared. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
