TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the guy claimed it was just friends, leading the author to move on and sleep with others. Later, it's revealed the guy was testing her loyalty.\n\nFirst, from the author's perspective, they believed the relationship was over. They were told to be friends, so they moved on, which is a common way to cope. The author didn't think they were being unfaithful since the relationship was supposedly broken off. Their actions were based on the information they had at the time.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's actions complicate things. By using a breakup as a test, he created ambiguity. He didn't clearly end the relationship but kept communication open, which might have led the author to believe they were still together. His decision to test her by maintaining contact after saying they were friends could be seen as manipulative. If he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction, he didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions clearly.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author acted based on the breakup being real, while the guy's behavior was confusing. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted on the information they were given. The responsibility lies with the guy for not being clear about his intentions. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
