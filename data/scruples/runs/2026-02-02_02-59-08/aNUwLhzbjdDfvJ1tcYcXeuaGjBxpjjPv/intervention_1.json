TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup that turned out to be a test, and the author sleeping with others after that. \n\nFirst, the guy ended the relationship, stating they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, moved on by dating others on Tinder. The key point here is whether the breakup was genuine or a test. The author believed it was a breakup, hence no obligation to be faithful. However, the guy later revealed it was a test to see her reaction.\n\nThe question is about the author's actions. If the breakup was real, then sleeping with others isn't wrong. But if the guy never intended to break up, maybe the author acted inconsiderately. But from the author's perspective, she had every reason to believe it was over. She took steps to move on, which is understandable given the emotional state.\n\nThe guy's actions are questionable too. Using a fake breakup as a test is manipulative. The author isn't in a relationship anymore, so engaging with others isn't cheating in her eyes. Her actions were her way of dealing with the breakup. The fact that he got angry after revealing it was a test complicates things. But the author's mistake might be in trusting the breakup was real and not communicating further if she was unsure.\n\nHowever, the core of the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since she acted based on the belief that the relationship was over, she's not in the wrong. The real issue lies with the guy's deceptive behavior. So the answer should be B.\n"
