TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's ex decided to break up, they continued talking as friends, then the author started dating others on Tinder. The ex later revealed the breakup was a test and is now upset about the author sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The ex initiated the breakup, saying they should be friends. The author assumed that meant the relationship was over. In most relationships, if one person says it's over, the other is expected to respect that and not pursue a relationship elsewhere. However, the ex here later admits it was a test, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nThe author, in their heartbreak, started sleeping with others to regain self-esteem. They believed they were no longer in a relationship and thus not obligated to be faithful. From their perspective, they acted within their rights after the breakup. However, the ex's friend mentioned he was still in love and the breakup was a test. That complicates things because the ex didn't communicate their true feelings and instead used a breakup as a test. \n\nLegally and ethically, once a relationship is over, each person is free to date others. The ex's actions of testing the author's loyalty by breaking up and then being upset when the author moves on could be seen as manipulative. The author didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on the information they had. \n\nHowever, the author's decision to start seeing others so quickly after a breakup might be seen as insensitive if the ex still had feelings. But from the author's perspective, they were trying to move on. The ex's behavior of not being honest about their intentions is problematic. \n\nSo, in terms of fault, the ex might be at fault for using the breakup as a test without clear communication, leading to the author acting in good faith. The author isn't in the wrong for moving on after the breakup was declared. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
