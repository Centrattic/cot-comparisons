TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy ended their relationship, claiming he wanted to be just friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to boost her self-esteem, started dating others on Tinder and had sex. Then, when she mentioned it, he blocked her. But later, it turns out he was testing her loyalty by pretending to break up. Now he's angry that she slept with others even though they weren't officially together.\n\nFirst, the author thought it was a breakup. If she believed the relationship was over, then her actions might be justified from her perspective because there's no obligation after a breakup. But the twist is that he never actually ended the relationship; he was just testing her. So maybe the problem here is that there was confusion about the relationship status. \n\nBut the key point is consent and communication. The guy said they were just friends, but he wasn't clear about the boundaries. If he was still in love and testing her, he might have created a situation where his intentions were unclear. The author acted based on the information she had. However, sleeping with others right after a breakup might be seen as moving on quickly, which could be hurtful if he wasn't ready for that.\n\nOn the other hand, since he was \"testing\" her, he might have expected her to stay single to prove her loyalty. But if she didn't know that, she had no way of knowing to hold back. It's a bit of a double standard. He pretended to break up to test her, but then got upset when she didn't follow his unspoken rules. \n\nLegally and ethically, once a relationship is over (as the author believed), there's no obligation to remain faithful. The issue here is the lack of clear communication from the guy. He didn't set boundaries, so the author acted on the assumption that it was over. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup, even if it turned out he was lying about the breakup. \n\nBut maybe some people would argue that she should have been more cautious or considered his feelings. However, the main problem is his deception. He didn't clearly communicate his intentions, leading to confusion. So the author isn't at fault here. Answer B.\n"
