TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy \"broke up\" with her, she thought they were over, and then she started seeing other people. But later she found out that he was just testing her by breaking up, and now he's upset about her sleeping with others.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the assumptions made by both parties. The author thought the break-up was real, so she moved on. She got on Tinder and had sex with others because she felt they weren't in a relationship anymore. But the guy didn't actually end the relationship; he thought he was still in a relationship and was just testing her. \n\nSo, communication is a big issue here. The guy didn't clarify that the break-up wasn't real. He left it ambiguous. If he had been clear that he wasn't ending the relationship, then the author might have acted differently. But from her perspective, she believed it was over. She took steps to improve her self-esteem after a real break-up. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's actions were misleading. Using a fake break-up as a test is manipulative. He put her in a situation where she made decisions based on false information. So, maybe he's at fault for not being honest. However, the author did act on her belief that they were no longer in a relationship. \n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. If they were officially not in a relationship, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. The problem arises because he didn't actually end the relationship, so from his perspective, she cheated. But if she genuinely thought it was over, does that absolve her? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn relationships, clear communication is crucial. If someone says they want to be friends but doesn't clarify the status, it's the other person's responsibility to seek clarity. However, the guy's test was deceptive. He shouldn't have led her to believe it was a real break-up. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be entirely at fault because she acted on the information given. The guy's dishonesty complicates things. But some might argue that she should have made sure the status was clear before moving on. But given the context, it's more about the guy's manipulative behavior. Therefore, the answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
