TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on her situation. She was in a relationship, he broke up with her, she started sleeping with others, and now he's mad because he claims the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The guy ended the relationship, so from her perspective, they were no longer together. She moved on by dating others, which seems like a natural response to a breakup. But he later says it was a test to see her reaction, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nWait, if he broke up with her and they were no longer in a relationship, then technically, he had no right to be upset about her dating others. The problem here is his manipulation and testing her by breaking up. But she thought it was a real breakup. She didn't know he was still in love and wanted to test her. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, if the breakup was real, she's not in the wrong. But if he broke up with her to test her loyalty, then he's the one being deceitful. However, she assumed it was a real breakup. Therefore, her actions were based on that assumption. The issue here is his dishonesty, not hers. \n\nThe key point is that she acted under the belief that the relationship was over. She had no obligation to remain loyal once they were no longer in a relationship. His anger stems from his own manipulative behavior, not her actions. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
