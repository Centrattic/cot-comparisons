TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy said they were just friends after a breakup, and the author started seeing other people. Then the guy got mad because his \"breakup\" was a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy didn't explicitly say they were over; he said they should be friends. The author thought it was a breakup but maybe the guy had different intentions. The key point here is the communication. If the guy didn't clearly end the relationship, the author might have been under the impression they were still together. But wait, the guy claimed it was a breakup, so maybe the author thought they were free to date others. However, if the guy was still in love and the breakup was a test, then the author's actions could be seen as cheating, even if the guy's intentions were ambiguous. But the author believed they were no longer in a relationship. That's conflicting. If there's no clear communication, the author might not be in the wrong because they acted based on what they were told. On the other hand, if the guy was still emotionally involved, the author moving on could be hurtful. But fidelity is usually expected in a relationship. Since the author thought it was over, maybe they aren't at fault. However, the guy's friend says the breakup was a test, which complicates things. The author might have made a mistake by assuming it was a real breakup without confirmation. There's ambiguity here. Maybe the answer depends on whether the guy made his intentions clear. If the guy never said they were over, then the author could be in the wrong. But if he said they should be friends, leading the author to think it was over, then the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer might be B because the author acted based on the information given, even if the guy had hidden motives. The author didn't have reason to know it wasn't a real breakup. So they aren't in the wrong. But another perspective is that the guy didn't end it properly, so the author shouldn't have moved on. Hmm. I'm torn, but leaning towards B because the author followed his lead, even if it was a misunderstanding.\n"
