TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but the other person didn't feel the same. The guy broke up, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others to boost self-esteem, thinking they were no longer a couple. Then, the guy reveals the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. He's now angry and blocked them.\n\nFirst, the guy called it off and said they should be friends. The author acted on that, assuming they were over. Sleeping with others after a breakup is common, but the twist here is the guy's test. The key point is whether the breakup was real or a test. If the guy never truly ended the relationship, then the author might be in the wrong. But if he actually ended it, then the author wasn't cheating.\n\nBut here's the catch: the guy didn't make it clear that the breakup was a test. He claimed it was a break up, so the author acted on that. However, if the guy intended to continue the relationship under the guise of a breakup, maybe the author made a mistake by moving on. The problem is the guy's dishonesty. He didn't communicate his true intentions. The author slept with others based on the assumption they were over. So technically, if the relationship was over, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the guy's test meant the relationship wasn't over, then the author did something he didn't want. However, the guy's deception is a big factor. The author can't be blamed for acting on what they were told. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the guy's test was deceptive and the author followed his lead.\n"
