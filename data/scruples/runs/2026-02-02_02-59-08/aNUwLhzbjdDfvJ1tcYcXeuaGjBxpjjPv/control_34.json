TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points here are the timeline of the breakup and the actions taken by both parties.\n\nFirst, the guy claims he broke up with her and they should be just friends. She, heartbroken, starts dating others on Tinder as a way to boost her self-esteem. Then she mentions sleeping with others, and he gets angry because he later reveals the breakup was a test to see her reaction. He's still in love and wanted to see if she'd stay loyal.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the breakup was genuine or a test. If he said they were breaking up but it was actually a test, then technically they were still in a relationship. In that case, sleeping with others while he was testing her loyalty could be seen as breaking the trust. But from her perspective, she believed they were no longer a couple. \n\nHowever, in relationships, even if one person is testing, the other might still be in a committed state unless there's a clear agreement. If he didn't communicate that the breakup was a test, she had no way of knowing. But once he initiated the breakup, she moving on seems reasonable. His anger might stem from his own manipulation since he didn't clarify the situation. \n\nBut the problem is that he considered the breakup a test, so he still expected her to be faithful even though he ended the relationship. That's a bit contradictory. Her actions were based on the belief that they were over. However, if there's an unspoken rule that he's testing her, that's on him for not being clear. But in most cases, once a breakup is declared, the expectation of monogamy ends. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. His anger could be due to his own flawed approach. But there's a nuance here. If the breakup was a test, then technically, the relationship wasn't really over, so her actions could be seen as cheating. However, since he didn't communicate that, it's a tricky situation. \n\nBut in real relationships, testing someone by breaking up isn't a standard practice. So the responsibility might lie more with him for not being honest about his intentions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on his initial breakup statement. The answer would be B.\n"
