TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that they were in a relationship, the guy called it off, saying they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to boost self-esteem, used Tinder and slept with others. Then the guy found out and got angry, even though he later admitted he broke up with her as a test to see what she'd do.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the communication and the context of the breakup. The guy said they should be friends, but then later his friend said it was a test. So, was the breakup real or not? If he didn't actually break up with her, then maybe she was still in a relationship, but if he did, then she's not obligated. But the problem is that he's now upset she was with others, even though he ended things. \n\nBut wait, if he was still in love and it was a test, does that mean he never intended to end the relationship? That's confusing. If he called it off, regardless of his true feelings, she was acting on the assumption that it was over. So, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't cheating unless there were specific agreements otherwise. However, if he didn't actually break up with her, but used a breakup as a test, then maybe she was still in a relationship. But how would she know that? He's the one who initiated the breakup. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't clarify his intentions. If he said they were just friends, she had every right to move on. His testing her reactions doesn't seem fair. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
