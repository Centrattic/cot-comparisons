TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author was in a relationship where the guy decided to break up, saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but eventually accepted it. To boost their self-esteem, they used Tinder and slept with others since they thought the relationship was over. However, the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test to see how the author would react. He actually still loved them and was upset about them sleeping with others, leading to a block and refusal to talk.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy said it was a breakup, the author moved on by dating others, but the guy's intention was to test their loyalty. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author believed the relationship was over because the guy said so. If someone breaks up with you, the reasonable expectation is that the relationship is ending. The author, in good faith, moved on. However, the guy's action of breaking up as a test is questionable. By claiming to end the relationship to test the author's actions, he might have manipulated the situation. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, they had no way of knowing it was a test. They acted based on the information given. Sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong unless there are ongoing commitments. However, if the guy didn't actually end the relationship, the author might have been in the wrong. But the problem here is that the guy misrepresented his intentions. He pretended to break up to test the author, which is deceitful.\n\nIn many relationships, fidelity is expected while in the relationship, but once it's over, it's generally acceptable to move on. The guy's action of breaking up as a test complicates things. The author acted on the belief that the relationship was over. The guy's issue is with the author being unfaithful during a test, but that's a bit of a trap scenario. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? If the guy never actually ended the relationship, maybe the author was still in a committed situation and sleeping with others was wrong. But the guy's actions were deceptive. The author had every reason to believe the relationship was over. The guy's problem is that he didn't communicate his true feelings and set up a test without being honest. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I The Asshole), the community often looks at who acted in bad faith. The guy's test was manipulative, and the author acted based on the breakup they were told. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they followed the breakup. The guy's actions are questionable for setting up a test. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
