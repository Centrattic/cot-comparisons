TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (the author) was in a relationship with a guy. He \"broke up\" with her, saying they should just be friends. She thought it was over, so she started using Tinder and slept with others to help her self-esteem. Now, she found out he was just testing if she'd stay faithful, and he's mad at her for sleeping with others even though they weren't together anymore.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the author was wrong to sleep with other people after the breakup. Let's break it down. First, when a relationship ends, even if it's not clear, does the ex still have any claim on your fidelity? The author thought they were done, so from her perspective, there was no reason to be faithful. But the guy claims he broke up with her as a test, which implies he never really intended to end the relationship. That's a bit manipulative, right? If someone breaks up with you under the guise of wanting to be friends but is actually testing you, that's not honest.\n\nBut the author made the assumption that the breakup was real. So she acted on the information she had at the time. If the guy was intentionally misleading her, maybe he's the one in the wrong for not being upfront. However, the author could have asked for clarification. Maybe she didn't confirm if they were truly over. But in typical breakups, if someone says it's over, you usually take them at their word unless there's a history of games.\n\nThen there's the aspect of moving on. After a breakup, it's common for people to seek new relationships to heal. The author's actions were her way of dealing with heartbreak. But the guy's anger comes from the fact that he was still emotionally involved and saw her actions as betrayal, even though they weren't technically in a relationship anymore.\n\nWait, but if the guy was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty, maybe he's not in the right either. He manipulated the situation, leading her to believe the breakup was real. However, the author's main point is whether she was wrong. If they were broken up, then sleeping with others isn't cheating. But if the breakup was a test, then she might have failed his test, which makes him upset. But from an ethical standpoint, the author had no obligation to stay loyal once they were supposedly over. The guy's test is more of a manipulative tactic, which is problematic on his end.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The ex's actions were deceptive. However, if there was a mutual understanding that they were still an item and just taking a break, then maybe she would be wrong. But the scenario says he said they were just friends. So, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
