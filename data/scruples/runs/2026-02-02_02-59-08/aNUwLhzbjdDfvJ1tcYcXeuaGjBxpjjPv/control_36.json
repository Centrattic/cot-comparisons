TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup, especially when the ex's friend says the breakup was a test.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author was in a relationship where they were in love, but the guy didn't reciprocate as much. He broke up to be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others. Then, when the guy found out, he got angry because he actually still loved her and the breakup was a test. Now he's blocking her and won't talk.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with others after the breakup. The key point is whether the breakup was mutual or if there was any misunderstanding. The author believed it was a breakup, and the guy later claims it wasn't a real breakup but a test. But in reality, when someone breaks up with you, even if they have ulterior motives, the person who was dumped is within their rights to move on. The author had no obligation to stay faithful if they weren't in a relationship anymore. The guy's action of making it a test without being honest is problematic. He led her to believe the relationship was over, so she acted accordingly. His anger seems unjustified because he was the one who initiated the breakup and then later had different intentions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
