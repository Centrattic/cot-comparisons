TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, saying it's better as friends. The author, heartbroken, then starts dating others via Tinder to boost self-esteem. The guy later reveals it was a test, he still loved her, and now he's angry she slept with others after they weren't a couple anymore.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy said it was a breakup. The author assumed that meant they weren't together anymore. She then moved on, slept with others. The guy later admits it was a test, not a real breakup. Now he's upset because he thought she was cheating during the test.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. From her perspective, she thought it was over. She had no obligation to remain faithful once the relationship ended. But the guy lied about the breakup being a test. That's a bit of a red flag. He didn't communicate his intentions clearly. He told her it was over, so she acted accordingly. If you break up with someone, even if it's a test, you can't later hold them accountable for moving on because you lied about the status of the relationship. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Did the guy ever clarify that the breakup wasn't final? If he said it was just to be friends, but kept talking and trying to test her reaction, that's a bit manipulative. The author had every right to move on once the relationship was over. So, technically, she wasn't in the wrong because they weren't in a relationship anymore when she slept with others. The guy's anger stems from his own deception. \n\nHowever, if the guy thought he was still in a relationship, even though he told her to break up, that's confusing. But from the author's side, she had no reason to believe it was a test. The guy is the one who didn't set clear boundaries. So the author isn't at fault here. The problem is the guy's lack of honesty. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
