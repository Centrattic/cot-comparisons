TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup that turned out to be a test. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy ended the relationship, saying they should just be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others via Tinder. Later found out the breakup was a test to see if the author would stay loyal. Now the guy is angry because the author slept with others even though they weren't officially in a relationship anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author believed the relationship was over. The guy didn't clarify that the breakup was a test. The author acted on their belief that the relationship had ended. The guy's test was deceptive. \n\nIn terms of morality and societal norms, if a person has ended a relationship and clearly stated they want to be friends, the other person might feel they're free to date others. However, if the breakup was a test, the initial person didn't communicate their true intentions. The author's actions were based on the information they had at the time. \n\nBut here's the catch: even if the breakup was a test, the author wasn't aware. The guy's deception is problematic. The author isn't responsible for the other person's hidden motives. So the author's actions are justified based on their understanding. However, some might argue that the author should have known the guy was still in love and maybe not moved on so quickly. But the author's actions were in response to a breakup, which is a common way to deal with heartbreak. \n\nOn the other hand, if the guy was testing loyalty, then any action the author took could be seen as failing the test. But that's a bit of a twisted way to handle things. The guy's behavior is manipulative. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted based on the breakup being real. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they made decisions based on the information they had and the breakup was not clear as a test at the time.\n"
