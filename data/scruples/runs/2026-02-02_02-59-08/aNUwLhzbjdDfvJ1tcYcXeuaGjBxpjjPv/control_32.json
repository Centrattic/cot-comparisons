TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with others after a breakup, but it turns out the breakup was a test.\n\nSo, the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, the author moved on by dating others, and then the guy realized he still wanted to be together and got upset. The main question is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. When someone breaks up, it's generally assumed that the relationship is over. The author thought they were single, so they moved on, which is a common way to deal with heartbreak. The fact that the guy was using the breakup as a test complicates things. If he never actually ended the relationship but was just testing her loyalty, then maybe the author didn't know the relationship was still ongoing. But the guy did say it was a break up, so the author had a reason to believe they were no longer in a relationship.\n\nEthically, if two people are not in a committed relationship, sleeping with others is not cheating. The author didn't have an obligation to stay faithful if they were no longer dating. However, the guy's perspective is that he was still in love and the break-up was a test, which he now regrets. From his side, he expected her to wait, but he never communicated that expectation clearly. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The guy didn't make it clear that the break-up was a test, so the author had no reason to know. The author acted based on the information she had. The guy's anger seems to stem from his own miscalculations and lack of clear communication. \n\nIn many cases, when someone breaks up, the other person is expected to move on. The author is doing that, which is healthy. The guy's behavior of using a break-up as a test is problematic because it's deceptive. If he was still in love and wanted to test her, he should have been honest about his feelings and intentions instead of pretending to break up. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted in good faith based on the breakup she was told about. The guy's actions were deceptive, and his expectation that she wait without knowing the truth is unfair. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
