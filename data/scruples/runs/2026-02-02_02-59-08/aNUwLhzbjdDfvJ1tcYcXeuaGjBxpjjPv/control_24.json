TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy called it off, saying they should just be friends. The author was heartbroken but eventually started talking again as friends. Then, to boost their self-esteem, they used Tinder and slept with others. Now the guy is angry because he says the breakup was a test, and he still loves them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions here. If someone is in a relationship and then one person says they want to be friends, that's a breakup. The author believed it was over and thus wasn't obligated to be faithful. But the guy later says it was a test. The key point is whether the breakup was genuine or if it was a test. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they trusted the breakup. When someone says they want to be friends, unless there's some context suggesting otherwise, it's reasonable to consider the relationship ended. The author acted accordingly by moving on, which is a natural response to a breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy claims he was still in love and it was a test. But the problem is that using a breakup as a test to see if the other person would move on isn't a standard practice. That seems manipulative. If he was still in love, why would he break up? Also, the author had no way of knowing it was a test. They acted in good faith based on his words.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed what was communicated to them. The guy's actions were deceptive. The author made a mistake in judgment by sleeping with others right after the breakup, but that's more about their own healing process. However, since the relationship was supposedly over, the author wasn't in the wrong for seeking attention elsewhere. \n\nThe main issue is the guy's manipulation. He didn't clearly communicate his intentions, leading the author to believe the breakup was real. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here.\n"
