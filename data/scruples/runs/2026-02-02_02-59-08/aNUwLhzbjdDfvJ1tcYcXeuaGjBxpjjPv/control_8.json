TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. The guy later reveals that the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay loyal, and he's now angry.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The guy said they were just friends after the breakup. The author believed that and thought she wasn't obligated to be faithful anymore. She used Tinder and had sex with others, which she thought was acceptable because they were no longer a couple. However, the guy later claimed the breakup was a test, meaning he never intended to end the relationship. Now he's upset because she slept with others during this time.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she acted based on the information given to her. If the guy had told her the breakup was a test, then she might have known it wasn't over. But he didn't. He said they were only friends, so she moved on. From an external viewpoint, if the relationship was actually ongoing, even if he called it a test, then the author might be in the wrong for sleeping with others. But since the guy didn't clarify that the breakup wasn't real, it's unclear if he had the right to expect her to stay faithful.\n\nBut in most relationships, if someone says they're breaking up, it's generally accepted that the relationship is over. The author isn't obligated to stay loyal if the relationship is officially terminated. However, if the guy didn't actually end the relationship in the eyes of the law or society, maybe there's a different angle. But typically, after a breakup, people are free to date others. The problem here is that the guy's actions were deceptive. He didn't communicate properly, and the author acted on his stated intentions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the breakup was genuine, then no. If it was a fake breakup (test) that wasn't communicated clearly, then the guy is in the wrong for not being honest. The author had no way of knowing it was a test. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's anger stems from a lack of communication and deception on his part. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
