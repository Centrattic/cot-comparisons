TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author was in a relationship with a guy who broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She was heartbroken but tried to move on. To boost her self-esteem, she started using Tinder and had sex with others. She thought it was okay because they weren't together anymore. Later, she told him, and he blocked her. It turns out he had broken up with her as a test to see how she'd react. Now he's angry about her sleeping with others while they weren't officially a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The guy said they were breaking up, so from her perspective, they weren't in a relationship anymore. If that's true, then she wasn't cheating because they weren't together. However, the twist is that he actually broke up with her as a test to see her reaction. That complicates things because if the break-up wasn't real, then they were still in a relationship in his eyes, which means she might have been unfaithful. But from her point of view, she believed they were no longer together. \n\nThis is a classic case of miscommunication. The key point is whether the break-up was genuine or not. If the guy's intention was to test her, then his actions were deceptive. The author acted on the belief that the relationship was over, so she wasn't in the wrong for moving on. However, if the break-up was a test, then he's the one who was dishonest, and she's not at fault. \n\nBut some might argue that even if the break-up was a test, she should have clarified the situation instead of moving on. However, given that he was adamant about being friends only, she has a right to feel that the relationship was over. It's unfair to expect someone to stay loyal if they're not in a relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the break-up he declared. The guy's deception is the root issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
