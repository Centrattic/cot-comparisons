TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe person in the story was in a relationship with a guy she was deeply in love with. He didn't express the same level of love but hinted at it. He then decided to break up, saying they should be just friends. She got heartbroken but accepted it. To boost her self-esteem, she started using Tinder and slept with a few people. Later, when she mentioned this, he blocked her. His friend revealed that the breakup was a test to see what she would do, and he was still in love, now angry because she slept with others after the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The main issue is whether sleeping with others after a breakup, which was later revealed to be a test, is wrong. The author believed they were broken up and thus thought it was okay to date others. The other person's actions\u2014ending the relationship and then later claiming it was a test\u2014add complexity. \n\nLegally, there's nothing wrong with dating others after a breakup. Emotionally, the author was dealing with heartbreak and sought to regain her self-worth, which people often do. But the twist is that the guy's breakup was a test. If that's true, then the author might have made a decision based on a false premise. Yet, isn't it the responsibility of the person initiating the breakup to communicate clearly? If he was in a relationship but planning a test, maybe he's the one being deceptive. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. The author acted based on the belief that the relationship was over. If the other person's claim of a test is valid, he may have manipulated the situation. But the author still had the right to move on. The guy's anger might be misplaced, especially if he was unfaithful in the original relationship. However, the story doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author's actions were understandable as she was trying to heal. The guy's test was underhanded, and his reaction could be seen as controlling. But people might argue that if the relationship was supposed to be exclusive, the author should have waited until it was clearly over. However, the initial breakup was communicated, even if it was a test. The author had no way of knowing it wasn't real at the time. \n\nThe user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to consider both sides. The author's actions were based on the breakup, so in that sense, she's not wrong. The guy didn't clearly state that the breakup was a test, which is dishonest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
