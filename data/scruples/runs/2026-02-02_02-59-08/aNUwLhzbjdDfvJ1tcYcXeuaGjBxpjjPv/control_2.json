TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario from Friends. The author was in a relationship where the guy didn't reciprocate feelings as strongly. He broke up, saying they should just be friends. She took that as a breakup, started dating others, but now he's mad because he was using the breakup as a test to see if she'd stay faithful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial breakup. If the guy said they were just friends, then technically they weren't in a relationship anymore. The author had every right to date others after a breakup. However, the twist here is that the guy's breakup was a test. But from the author's perspective, she had no way of knowing it was a test. She made the reasonable assumption that he was ending the relationship. \n\nEthically, if someone breaks up with you, you're not obligated to stay single. The author's actions were based on the belief that the relationship was over. The guy's anger seems misplaced because he didn't clarify his intentions. He might have been in denial about the breakup. The author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's manipulation through a fake breakup complicates things, but the author isn't responsible for his deceit. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
