TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She thought it was a real breakup, so she moved on by sleeping with others to boost her self-esteem. But then the guy actually wasn't done; he was testing her, and now he's mad because she slept with other people. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of a breakup. If someone breaks up with you, especially saying they want to be friends and you're not in a committed relationship anymore, then technically you're single. So, moving on and dating others isn't inherently wrong. However, the guy's friend said the breakup was a test. That complicates things because he might have intended to get back together based on her reaction. But the author didn't know that; she believed the breakup was final. \n\nThe key point here is the author's intent versus the guy's hidden motives. The author thought she was free to see others because the breakup was real. The guy, on the other hand, made a mistake by testing her by breaking up, which is a manipulative move. If the breakup was genuine, then the author isn't wrong for moving on. However, if the breakup was a test, then she might have failed his test, but that's his fault for using gaslighting tactics.\n\nAlso, emotional honesty is important. The guy didn't communicate his true feelings or intentions. The author acted based on the information she had, which was a breakup. So, in that sense, she's in the right. The guy's anger stems from his own manipulative actions. \n\nBut maybe some people would argue that sleeping with others right after a breakup is too soon, but the timeline isn't specified. The main issue here is the guy's test. If he didn't make his intentions clear, he can't blame her for moving on. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup he initiated, and his test was a form of manipulation.\n"
