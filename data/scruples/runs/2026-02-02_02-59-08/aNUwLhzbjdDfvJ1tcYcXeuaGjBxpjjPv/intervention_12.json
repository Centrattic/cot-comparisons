TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with others after the breakup. First, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe author was in a relationship and the guy told her he wanted to be friends. She assumed it was a breakup. She started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. Then she found out that the guy was actually testing her by breaking up, and now he's upset because she slept with others while they were \"on a break\" for a test.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the clarity of the breakup and the expectations of fidelity. The guy didn't clearly communicate that he wasn't ending the relationship but testing it. But did the author have a right to assume it was over? If the guy said they should just be friends, but then expected her to stay faithful, that's a problem. However, if the author thought it was a genuine breakup, then sleeping with others might be acceptable. But wait, the guy's friend says the breakup was a test. So, was he still in a de facto relationship? If the author believed it was over, she might not be wrong. However, if the guy didn't explicitly say it was over and was using a test, then the author might have been in a gray area. \n\nBut in relationships, when someone says they want to be friends, even if it's a test, the other person might take it at face value. The guy's actions were misleading. However, the author did sleep with others assuming the relationship was over. So, maybe she's in the right because she had no way of knowing it wasn't a real breakup. On the other hand, if the guy never actually ended the relationship, then she was still in a committed relationship and cheating. It's a bit of a toss-up. The author's actions were based on her understanding of the breakup, which might not have been accurate. But the guy's test is a bit manipulative. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the guy's initial breakup claim was ambiguous. The author might not be wrong if she believed the relationship was over. However, if the guy considered it an ongoing relationship, then she might be at fault. But since he never clarified that it wasn't a real breakup, the author's assumption could be reasonable. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
