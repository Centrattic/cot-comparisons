TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship where the guy broke up with her, claiming they should just be friends. After the breakup, she started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. The guy later says the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful, and now he's angry and blocked her. The question is whether she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The guy broke up with her and said they should be friends. The author believed they were over and thus moved on by sleeping with others. The guy's friend revealed that the breakup was a test to see if she'd remain loyal. Now he's upset she moved on, but she thought they were done. \n\nSo, the main issue is consent and communication. If the breakup was genuine, then the author wasn't in the wrong for moving on. But if the guy never actually ended the relationship and was just testing her, then she might have been in a situation where the rules of the relationship were unclear. However, from her perspective, she believed they were no longer in a relationship. The guy was the one who initiated the breakup, so she acted based on that. Even if his intention was a test, he didn't communicate that clearly. She had a right to move on if she thought they were over. Plus, he was the one who said they should be friends, yet expected her to stay loyal without any communication. \n\nBut wait, in some cases, even if someone breaks up with you, if there's ambiguity, it could be a problem. But in this case, the guy was adamant about just being friends. The author's actions were based on his stated intentions. If he lied about the breakup being final, that's on him. She couldn't have known it was a test. So the fault might lie with him for not being honest about his intentions. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's anger stems from his own deceptive actions. \n\nAnother angle: infidelity. If they were still in a relationship, sleeping with others would be cheating. But if the breakup was real, then it's not. The key is whether the relationship was truly over. Since the guy later admitted it was a test, implying they were still in a relationship, but he never clarified that. So the author was misinformed. In that case, she's not at fault because he didn't set the right boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted based on the breakup he initiated, and the deception was on his part. He should have been clear about his intentions if he wanted to test her, but that's not ethical either. The responsibility lies with him for not communicating properly.\n"
