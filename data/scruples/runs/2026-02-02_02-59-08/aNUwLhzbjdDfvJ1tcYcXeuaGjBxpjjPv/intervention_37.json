TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy ended the relationship, and the girl assumed it was a breakup. She then started seeing other people on Tinder. But later found out that the guy was just testing her and still wanted to be together. He's now upset because she slept with others after they weren't in a relationship anymore.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the nature of the breakup and the expectations of fidelity. The guy said they should be friends, and the girl took that as a breakup. If they were officially broken up, then technically she's not cheating by sleeping with others. However, if the guy's \"breakup\" was a test and he still considered them in a relationship, then she might have violated his expectations.\n\nBut here's the thing: If the guy told her he wanted to be just friends, and he was adamant about that, then from her perspective, it's a legitimate breakup. She had no reason to know he was testing her. People don't usually go into relationships expecting the other person to test their loyalty with a fake breakup. The problem here might be that the guy's actions were deceptive. He didn't communicate his intentions clearly. If he wanted to test her, that's on him. The girl acted based on the information she had.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that even if they were broken up, sleeping with others so quickly after a breakup could be seen as moving on too fast, but that's more about social judgment rather than right or wrong. Legally and ethically, once a breakup is confirmed, you're not in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. But the guy's anger stems from the fact that he considered the breakup a test, meaning he never intended to end the relationship. That's a communication issue on his part. He didn't clarify that he was testing her, so the girl couldn't have known.\n\nSo, considering all that, the girl isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup being real. The guy's actions were deceptive. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
