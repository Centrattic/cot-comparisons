TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author was in a relationship where they were deeply in love, but their partner didn't reciprocate the same feelings. The partner decided to break up, saying they wanted to be friends. The author, heartbroken, started using Tinder and slept with others after the breakup, thinking it was okay since they weren't in a relationship anymore. However, the ex later revealed that the breakup was a test to see what the author would do, and now he's angry and blocked them.\n\nThe main issue here is whether sleeping with others after a breakup is wrong, especially if the breakup was a test. The author believed the relationship was over, so from their perspective, they had no obligation to stay faithful. However, the ex's friend mentioned that the breakup was a test, which the author wasn't aware of. The ex now feels betrayed because the author didn't stay celibate during the test.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The ex didn't communicate clearly that the breakup was a test. The author acted on the assumption that the relationship was over. The ex's actions here are a bit manipulative because they didn't clarify their intentions. The author's decision to move on by dating others isn't inherently wrong if the relationship was truly over. The problem arises from the ex's lack of transparency. The author didn't know the breakup was a test, so they had no reason to expect that the ex wanted them to stay single.\n\nHowever, some might argue that even if the relationship was over, the ex's feelings were still important, and the author's actions hurt them. But from the author's standpoint, they were trying to heal and move on, which is a common and understandable response after a breakup. The ex's \"test\" is a bit of a red flag because it's an unusual and manipulative approach to relationships. The author can't be blamed for acting on the information they had at the time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to a breakup they believed to be real and valid. The ex's anger stems from their own deceptive actions, not the author's actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
