TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then started dating others on Tinder, thinking it was okay because they were no longer a couple. But then he revealed the breakup was a test, and he's angry because she slept with others. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the timeline and the expectations. The key points here are communication and the nature of the breakup. The guy said they should be friends, and the author took that as a breakup. She then moved on, which is understandable. But the guy later claims it was a test to see if she'd stay loyal. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author was in a committed relationship when she started seeing others. If the breakup was genuine, then she's not in the wrong. But if the guy never actually ended the relationship and was just testing her, then she might be in the wrong for not knowing. However, the problem is that the guy's actions were deceptive. He initiated the breakup, leading her to believe it was over. She had every right to move on, especially since he didn't clarify that it was just a test. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If he was still in love and wanted to test her loyalty without being upfront, that's manipulative. The author acted based on his initial statement. So, the fault might lie more with him for being deceptive rather than her for moving on after a breakup. However, some might argue that if they were still in a relationship (even if not officially), then she was wrong. But since he said it was over, she had no obligation. \n\nAlso, the fact that he blocked her and is angry now could be his own fault for not being clear. The author's actions were based on what he told her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed his lead. The guy's dishonesty is the root problem here.\n"
