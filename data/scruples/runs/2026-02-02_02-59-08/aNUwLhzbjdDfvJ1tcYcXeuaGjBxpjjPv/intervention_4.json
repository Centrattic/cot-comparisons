TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the guy broke up with the author, who then started sleeping with other people. But now the guy says he was just testing her loyalty and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author believed she was in a breakup, so she wasn't in a relationship anymore. In that case, she might think she's allowed to see other people. But the guy later claimed the breakup was a test, which complicates things. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if someone is in a breakup, they might still have feelings, and maybe the guy didn't make it clear he wanted to end things. However, the author made the assumption based on his initial statement. She acted on her understanding of the situation. \n\nNow, when he later says he was testing her, that's a bit manipulative. If he really wanted to test her loyalty, that's his own issue. But the author, thinking the relationship was over, moved on. She wasn't in a relationship anymore, so from her perspective, sleeping with others isn't cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guy didn't communicate his intentions properly. But the author's responsibility is to act based on the information given. If he said they were just friends, then she's within her rights to explore other connections. \n\nHowever, there's also the emotional aspect. She was still in love with him, and the way she handled her emotions might have been a way to cope. But the guy's reaction seems to stem from his own hidden agenda. \n\nSo, is she wrong? If they were no longer in a relationship, then she's not in the wrong for moving on. The guy's initial breakup was the issue, and his testing her loyalty afterward is his fault. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong. But wait, sometimes people expect monogamy even after a breakup if there's uncertainty. But in this case, he had said it was a breakup, so maybe she was justified. \n\nHmm. So the key is whether their relationship was truly over. If he said it was over, then she's not in the wrong. Even if he had ulterior motives, she acted based on his statement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
