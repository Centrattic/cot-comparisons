TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with her, claiming they should be friends. She then started dating other people on Tinder, thinking it was okay because they were no longer a couple. Later, she found out that the break up was a test, and he was still in love with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries. When someone breaks up, the expectation is usually that the relationship is over. The OP thought it was over, so she moved on. But the guy didn't actually end the relationship; he was testing her. That's a bit manipulative. However, the OP assumed it was a real break up and acted accordingly. \n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he might feel betrayed because he had feelings and wanted to see her reaction. But if he didn't communicate clearly, maybe it's his fault for not being honest. The OP's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. So, was she wrong to move on? \n\nAlso, the guy is now upset because she was with others, but he kept talking to her after the \"break up.\" If he was okay with being friends and didn't clarify that it was a test, maybe he's at fault. The OP had a right to seek emotional support and move on, especially since her self-esteem was low. \n\nBut some might argue that even if it was a test, the OP didn't know. She might have broken trust if she was still in a relationship, but since he ended it, she wasn't in a relationship anymore. The key is whether the break up was real. If he ended it, she has the right to date others. His test was a secret, so the blame might lie with him for the unclear intentions. \n\nIn conclusion, the OP isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's test was manipulative and not communicated, so he's more at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
