TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy breaks up with her, saying they should be friends. She's heartbroken but eventually moves on. To boost her self-esteem, she starts dating on Tinder and sleeps with a few people. Then when she mentions this, he gets mad because he says his breakup was just a test to see where her loyalties were.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy initiated the breakup, but later claims it was a test. The author believed they were no longer in a relationship and thus not obligated to be faithful. She slept with others after the breakup. Now the guy is upset because he was still in love and wanted to test her response.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, when a relationship ends, unless there are specific agreements like being exclusive even post-breakup (which is rare), the ex is generally free to date others. The guy's actions here are confusing. If he broke up with her, then he can't really expect her to stay celibate for him. However, if he lied about the breakup being a test, maybe he had different intentions. But the problem is he didn't communicate that test to her. She had every right to believe they were over, so she moved on. His test was deceptive. \n\nOn the other hand, she did move on quickly and slept with others, which might have been hurtful if their breakup wasn't mutual. But the guy's main issue is that he used a breakup as a test, which is manipulative. If he was still in love, maybe he shouldn't have broken up with her in the first place. \n\nSo the author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. The guy's fault here is not being honest about his intentions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted based on the information she had. The guy's reaction is more about his own manipulative behavior. So answer B, No.\n"
