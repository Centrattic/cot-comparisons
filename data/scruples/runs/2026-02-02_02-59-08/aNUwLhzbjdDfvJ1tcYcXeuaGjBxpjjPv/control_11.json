TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after sleeping with new people following a breakup, which turned out to be a test by her ex.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The guy claimed to break up, said they should be friends, and she eventually started dating others. He later revealed the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. He's now angry because she didn't.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here. When a relationship ends, the expectations of fidelity can be murky. If both parties agree it's over, then moving on with others is generally acceptable. But if one party is still emotionally invested and the breakup was a test (even if not clear at the time), it complicates things.\n\nThe author thought they were broken up. She didn't stay loyal because she wasn't sure he loved her. But he didn't communicate clearly that he wasn't done. This is a communication breakdown on his part. He used a breakup as a test without being honest about his intentions. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the breakup was real, she's not in the wrong. If it was a test and he led her to believe they were over, then maybe she's not at fault. However, if there were unspoken agreements about remaining monogamous even after a breakup (like in some on-again-off-again situations), that could shift things.\n\nBut in most cases, once a breakup is declared, unless there's a clear agreement otherwise, people are expected to move on. His test was deceptive. He didn't tell her he was still in love and wanted to see her reaction; she had no way of knowing. So, he's being unfair by punishing her for moving on when he himself wasn't transparent.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She acted based on the information she had. The fault lies with him for not being upfront. So the answer is B.\n"
