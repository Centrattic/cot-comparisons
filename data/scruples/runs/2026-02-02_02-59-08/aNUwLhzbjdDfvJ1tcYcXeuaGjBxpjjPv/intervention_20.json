TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-partner said it was a break up, but later turns out it was a test. The author slept with others after the break up, thinking they were just friends. Now the ex is mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They believed they were no longer in a relationship, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. They were trying to move on, which is a common reaction. The ex's action of breaking up as a test is a bit of a manipulative move, maybe. But the author made the assumption that the relationship was over.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's friend says the break up was a test, and he wanted to see what the author would do. So maybe the ex didn't actually intend to break up but used that as a way to check the author's loyalty. If that's the case, the author had no way of knowing it wasn't a real break up. However, if the ex was still emotionally involved, then the author might have crossed a line by moving on so quickly.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author was in the wrong. If the break up was real, then the author's actions aren't cheating. But if the ex didn't actually end the relationship, then the author was being unfaithful. However, since the ex told them to be friends and was adamant, the author had a reason to believe it was over. The problem is the ex's manipulation here. The author acted based on the information they were given. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they acted based on the ex's decision to end the relationship. The fault might lie more with the ex for using a fake break up as a test. However, some might argue that the author should have known the ex still had feelings. But there's no indication that the author knew that. The ex was clear about wanting to be friends, so the author had every right to move on. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted based on the ex's stated intentions. The ex's behavior is more questionable here for manipulating the situation.\n"
