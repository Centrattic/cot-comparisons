TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup, which turned out to be a test by her ex.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The guy called it off, saying they should be friends. The author thought it was a breakup, so she moved on, using Tinder and sleeping with others. Later, she found out it was a test, and he was still in love. He got angry and blocked her because he thought her actions were unfaithful.\n\nThe main issue here is the ambiguity of the breakup. If the guy intended to break up but lied about it being a test, that's on him. But the author acted on the assumption that they were over. However, if the guy still considered them in a relationship, even if he broke up with her, then she might be in the wrong. Wait, but once a breakup is declared, even if it's a test, the person who broke up is legally and morally not in a relationship anymore. So the author's actions would be justified if the breakup was real. However, if the guy never actually ended the relationship and it was just a test, then the author was still in a relationship and cheating.\n\nBut the problem is that the guy did say it was a breakup. So the author had a reasonable belief they were over. But maybe the guy's intention (which was to test) doesn't matter if he communicated it as a breakup. Legally, once someone says it's over, the relationship is considered ended unless there's a mutual understanding otherwise. So from the author's perspective, she was single and free to date. The guy's test was a lie, which is on him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the breakup being real. However, maybe she should have known it was a test? But how could she? The guy didn't indicate that. So the author's actions were based on the information she had.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's reaction is problematic because he used a test that was deceptive. The author wasn't cheating if the relationship was over. So he's in the wrong for not being honest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
