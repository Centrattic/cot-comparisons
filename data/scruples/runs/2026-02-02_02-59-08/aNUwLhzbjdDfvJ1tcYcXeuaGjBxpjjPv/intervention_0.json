TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question was in a relationship where she was in love, but the guy never reciprocated the same level of feelings. He broke up with her to be just friends, and she continued to talk to him. After some time, she started dating others on Tinder to boost her self-esteem, thinking they were just friends now. Then she found out that the breakup was actually a test, and he was still in love with her, which made him furious at her for sleeping with others when they weren't \"officially\" together anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did she have a commitment with him once he ended the relationship? The guy said they should be friends, but he later admitted it was a test. She didn't know that at the time. Legally or ethically, once a relationship is broken off, the person is free to date others unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. However, the guy's test adds a layer of manipulation. She thought they were over, so from her perspective, she wasn't cheating. But he intended to see how she would act, which complicates things. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If the breakup was mutual or accepted, then her actions might be justified. However, if the guy never truly ended the relationship or if there were mixed signals, it's more ambiguous. However, given the information, she acted based on his initial breakup statement. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she trusted his initial decision to break up. The guy's test was deceptive. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
