TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends. The guy broke up with the author, saying they should just be friends. The author then used Tinder and slept with others, thinking they weren't in a relationship anymore. But the guy later revealed that the breakup was a test, and he was still in love, so he's angry now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man claimed to break up, so the author assumed they were no longer in a relationship. If the breakup was genuine, then the author isn't in the wrong because they were single. However, if the man was just testing her, then maybe the author didn't know the real status. But here's the thing: if he said they were just friends and that he thought it was better, even if he was lying, he didn't clarify that it was a test. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. \n\nSo, the author's actions were based on the assumption that the relationship was over. She didn't know it was a test. Therefore, from her perspective, she wasn't cheating. The man's behavior is questionable because he didn't communicate his true intentions. However, the author might not be in the wrong because she acted on the breakup as it was presented to her. On the other hand, some might argue that even if he said they were friends, if the breakup was a test, maybe there's some expectation of exclusivity. But the man didn't set that expectation. \n\nThe author's self-esteem was low, and she tried to move on, which is understandable. The man's anger stems from his own dishonesty. So, in terms of fault, the man's actions (lying about the breakup) might be the real issue here. The author isn't in the wrong because she didn't know it was a test. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
