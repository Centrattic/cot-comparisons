TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that her ex-boyfriend broke up with her, she moved on by dating others, and then he told her it was a test and is now angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy said they were just friends after the breakup. She thought it was over, so she used Tinder and had sex with others. Then he reveals the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay faithful. Now he's upset and blocked her.\n\nSo, the main issue is communication and understanding of the breakup. If the guy didn't clearly state that the breakup was a test, then she had every right to believe it was final. Cheating typically refers to being unfaithful while in a relationship. Since they were supposed to be just friends, having sex with others isn't cheating in that context. However, if the guy intended for the relationship to continue but under different terms, that's a problem.\n\nBut wait, he said he wanted to be friends, not that there was a test. The woman acted based on what he told her. The guy's actions seem deceptive because he didn't communicate his true intentions. He's holding her accountable for something he didn't clarify. She thought she was free to date others after the breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, if he believed the breakup was a test, maybe he expected her to wait for him, but that's not a standard practice. People usually expect that after a breakup, both parties are free to date unless there's an agreement otherwise. The guy's behavior is manipulative because he didn't set clear boundaries beforehand. \n\nSo the woman isn't in the wrong because she acted on the information given. The man is responsible for not being honest about his intentions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
