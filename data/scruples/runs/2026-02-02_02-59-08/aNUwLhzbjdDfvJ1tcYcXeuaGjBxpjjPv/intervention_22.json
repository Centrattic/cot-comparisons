TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with the author, saying they should be friends. The author then started dating other people on Tinder to boost her self-esteem. Later, the guy admitted that the breakup was a test to see if she'd stay loyal, and he's upset she moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author believed the relationship was over, so from her perspective, she wasn't in a committed relationship anymore. When someone breaks up, it's generally expected that the relationship is over, and both parties are free to move on. So if the guy truly ended the relationship, sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating from the author's side.\n\nBut wait, the guy said it was a test. So maybe he didn't really break up with her, but used the breakup as a way to check her loyalty. But from the author's point of view, she had no way of knowing that. The guy presented it as a real breakup, making her believe it was over. If he didn't communicate his intentions clearly, then the author isn't at fault for trusting his words.\n\nThe key here is whether the breakup was genuine or not. If the guy's actions were deceptive, then the author's response is understandable. However, if the breakup was real, then the author did nothing wrong. But since the guy didn't clarify his intentions, the author acted in good faith based on the information she had.\n\nAnother angle: cheating usually involves being in a relationship and being unfaithful. If the relationship was truly over, then the author isn't cheating. The guy's test complicates things, but his actions led to the situation. He might have unrealistic expectations by pretending to break up to test her loyalty. That's a bit manipulative on his part.\n\nIn most cases, when someone breaks up, the expectation is that both can move on. The author did that, which is a normal reaction. The guy's anger comes from his own manipulation, not the author's actions. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because she acted based on the breakup being real. The guy's test was his own flawed approach, leading to his hurt feelings.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No) because the author wasn't in the wrong; she acted based on the breakup being genuine, and the guy's test was his own issue.\n"
