TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The scenario is similar to the Ross and Rachel situation from Friends, where Ross declares a break-up to be friends, but Rachel is still in love. Now, the guy in the story claims he broke up to be friends, but later reveals it was a test to see what the author would do. The author, thinking they were no longer in a relationship, started dating others via Tinder, which upset the guy when he found out, leading to a block.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy said they should just be friends, so from the author's perspective, the relationship was over. The author tried to move on and boosted their self-esteem by dating others, which they felt justified because they weren't in a relationship anymore. However, the guy later confessed that the breakup was a test, implying he never actually ended the relationship but wanted to check the author's loyalty.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the guy never intended to break up and considered the relationship still active, then the author's actions could be seen as infidelity. But if the author genuinely believed they were not in a relationship anymore, then their actions were based on that belief. The problem arises from the guy's deception. By declaring a breakup as a test, he set up a scenario where the author acted under the assumption that they were free to date others. The guy then used the author's actions against them, which is problematic because he didn't communicate his real intentions.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if both parties had clear communication about the relationship status, the situation would be different. Since the guy was deceptive, the author couldn't have known they were still in a relationship. However, the author might be criticized for not clarifying the situation before moving on. But given the guy's manipulation, the fault might lie more with him. The author acted based on the information they had at the time.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The guy's actions were deceptive, but the author's actions were based on their belief. However, the author might be in the wrong if the breakup was genuine in the guy's mind, even if it was a test. But since the guy didn't clarify, it's a bit of a grey area. However, in most ethical frameworks, if a relationship is officially over, dating others isn't wrong. The guy's manipulation complicates things, but the author's actions are justified if they believed the relationship was over. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
