TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is that the person in the story was in a relationship with a guy who said they should just be friends, which the user took as a breakup. The user then started seeing other people on Tinder to boost their self-esteem. The guy later says the breakup was a test to see what the user would do, and he got angry when they slept with others. The user is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user was actually in a breakup. The guy said they should be friends, but the user thought that was a breakup. If the guy didn't clearly communicate that it was a breakup, maybe the user wasn't actually in a breakup. The user assumed they were free to date others, but if the guy was still considering the relationship ongoing (even though he said break up), then sleeping with others could be seen as cheating. However, if the guy's intention was just a test and he didn't clarify the breakup, then the user might not be at fault for acting on the information they had.\n\nAlso, the guy later admitted it was a test and is angry. But in a healthy relationship, if someone wants to test their partner's loyalty without being upfront, isn't that a problem? The user made a decision based on the breakup they were told about. The guy's actions might be manipulative. However, the user did act on their assumption that the relationship was over. If the guy didn't properly end the relationship, the user's mistake was in assuming they were single. So maybe the user isn't entirely at fault here. But if the guy clearly ended the relationship, then the user was right to move on. The confusion here is whether the \"breakup\" was real or a test. Since the user thought it was a breakup and acted accordingly, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the guy's intention was just to test, then the user had no way of knowing. So the answer might depend on whether the user had a reasonable belief that the relationship was over. The user's actions were based on that belief, so they might not be at fault. Alternatively, if the guy's test was part of an ongoing relationship, then the user was cheating. But since the guy didn't clarify that he was still in the relationship, the user might be in the right. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the key point is whether the breakup was real. If the guy said it was over, even if it was a test, the user had a right to believe it was a breakup. So the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
