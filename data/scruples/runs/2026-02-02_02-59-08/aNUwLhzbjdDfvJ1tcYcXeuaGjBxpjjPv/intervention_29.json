TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So the scenario is that the guy breaks up with her, she moves on by sleeping with other people, but later finds out that the breakup was a test. Now he's mad because she slept with others even though he claimed they were just friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. When a relationship ends, typically the expectation is that there are no commitments anymore. The woman thought they were broken up, so she started dating others. She was trying to build her self-esteem after the breakup. But then she found out the breakup was a test, and he wanted to see her reaction.\n\nThe key here is whether the breakup was legitimate. If the guy never actually ended the relationship, then maybe she was still in a committed relationship. But she thought it was over. The problem is that if he broke up with her, even if it was a test, from her perspective, she had no reason to stay exclusive. However, if he was still in love and the breakup wasn't real, maybe he expected her to stay faithful, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nBut in most cases, once someone says they want to be friends, unless there's an agreement otherwise, the expectation is that the relationship is over. She had no obligation to stay loyal. However, the issue is that she was still emotionally involved and maybe didn't communicate her feelings. But the main point is that he led her to believe the relationship was over, so she acted accordingly. \n\nOn the other hand, his actions were deceptive. He pretended to break up to test her, which is not a healthy approach. But she made the choice to move on, which is understandable. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether the breakup was real. Since he claimed it was a test, he didn't actually end it, so maybe he expected her to stay faithful. But that's not how relationships work. If he didn't end things properly, then she's not in the wrong for moving on. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No), because she acted based on his claim of a breakup. However, some might argue that if there was lingering commitment, she should have known. But generally, once a breakup is declared, the obligations end. His test made the situation confusing, but she's not to blame for following his lead.\n"
