TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is similar to the Ross and Rachel scenario, but real-life. The guy broke up and said they should be friends. The author, heartbroken, started dating others via Tinder to boost her self-esteem. Then she found out the guy was testing her by breaking up, and now he's mad because she slept with others even though they weren't officially together anymore.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the nature of the breakup. The guy said it was a breakup, but later claims it was a test. That's a bit manipulative. If he didn't really mean to break up, that's on him. But the author believed they were over. She had no obligation to stay faithful if they were truly not in a relationship anymore. \n\nHowever, the timing and communication matter. If he wanted to test her, that's his issue. He should have communicated his feelings honestly instead of using a breakup as a test. The author acted based on his stated decision to be friends. She tried to move on, which is a normal response. The fact that he was in love with her but didn't communicate that complicates things. \n\nAlso, sleeping with others after a breakup isn't inherently wrong, especially if both parties are no longer in a relationship. The problem here is his dishonesty about the breakup being a test. The author wasn't in the wrong for moving on when she thought it was over. His anger seems misplaced because he didn't clearly communicate his intentions. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy's actions were manipulative, and the author acted based on the information she had.\n"
