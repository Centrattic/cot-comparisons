TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated because of the emotional manipulation involved. So, the guy broke up with her, right? He said they should just be friends. The author, feeling heartbroken and trying to boost her self-esteem, started dating others through Tinder and slept with people. But then she found out that the guy had broken up with her as a test to see her reaction, and now he's angry because she was intimate with others even though they were supposed to be just friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries of their relationship. When he broke up with her, he said they should be friends. If that was a genuine breakup, then she had no obligation to stay faithful. However, if he was testing her by pretending to break up, then maybe there's some deception. But the author didn't know that at the time. She acted based on the information she had, which was that they were no longer in a relationship.\n\nThe key here is whether they were still in a relationship when she slept with others. If the guy ended the relationship, even if he was lying about it, then she's not in the wrong. But if he never actually ended the relationship and was just testing her, then maybe she did something wrong. However, the author had every reason to believe it was over because he told her so. The problem is he was dishonest about his intentions. He used a breakup as a test, which is manipulative.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she did what she thought was right given the situation. She wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others isn't cheating. The guy's issue is that he lied about the breakup being a test. His anger stems from his own manipulation, not her actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she followed the breakup as he presented it. The mistake was his for testing her loyalty through deceit.\n"
