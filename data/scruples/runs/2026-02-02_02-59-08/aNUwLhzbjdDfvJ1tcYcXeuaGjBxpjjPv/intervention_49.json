TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guy broke up with her, saying they should just be friends. She then started seeing others, thinking the relationship was over. But later he admitted he was testing her by breaking up, and now he's mad she cheated.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she was wrong to sleep with others after a breakup. Normally, if someone is in a serious relationship and the other person hasn't officially ended things, cheating would be wrong. But here, the guy claimed it was a breakup. If she believed it was over, then technically she wasn't in a relationship anymore, so sleeping with others wouldn't be cheating. However, the twist is he was still in love and thought he was testing her. If the breakup wasn't real, then she did cheat, which would make her in the wrong. But if the breakup was real, then she did what any person might do after a breakup to move on.\n\nBut there's ambiguity here. The guy didn't clearly communicate his intentions. He said it was a breakup but was only testing her. That's deceptive. If she had known it wasn't a real breakup, she wouldn't have done what she did. His behavior led her to believe the relationship was over. So maybe he's at least partly responsible. However, the author is the one who acted on the assumption that they were not in a relationship anymore. Even if he was testing her, if she genuinely believed it was over, she might not be at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut in relationships, honesty is key. He didn't tell her it was just a test. If he had been upfront, maybe the situation could have been different. But she also didn't check if the breakup was final before moving on. So maybe both have some responsibility here. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. If the breakup was real, then she's not in the wrong. If it wasn't, then she is. Since he said it was a breakup, even if it wasn't, she had a reason to believe it was. So maybe she isn't in the wrong. But if the breakup was a test, then she did cheat. It's a bit confusing. The answer might depend on the clarity of communication. Since the guy didn't clearly state it was a test, she might not be entirely at fault. So the answer could be B (No) because she acted on the information given, which she believed to be true.\n"
