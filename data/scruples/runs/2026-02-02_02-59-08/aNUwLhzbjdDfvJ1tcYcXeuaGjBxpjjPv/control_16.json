TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's partner broke up with them, so they started seeing other people. Now the ex says the breakup was a test and is upset about the author sleeping with others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author thought they were in a breakup, so they moved on by using Tinder and sleeping with others. The ex later claims it was a test to see if the author would stay faithful. \n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to sleep with others after the breakup. If the breakup was real, then the author isn't in the wrong because they were no longer in a committed relationship. However, if the breakup was a test (which the ex admitted), then the author might have been misled, but the ex's actions are questionable.\n\nBut the author assumed it was a breakup based on what the ex said. The ex was clear about wanting to be friends, and the author acted on that assumption. The ex's test is a bit manipulative, but the author isn't responsible for the ex's hidden motives. The author's actions were based on the information given at the time. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
