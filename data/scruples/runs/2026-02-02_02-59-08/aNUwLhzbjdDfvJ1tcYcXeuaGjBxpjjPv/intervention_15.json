TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-partner broke up with them, claiming they wanted to be just friends. The author, trying to move on, started dating and sleeping with others. Now the ex is upset because he says the breakup was a test and he's still in love with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The ex initiated the breakup, saying they should just be friends. The author, believing they're not in a relationship anymore, moves on. The ex later reveals that the breakup was a test to see the author's reaction. The ex is now angry because the author slept with others, even though they were supposedly not a couple anymore.\n\nSo the question is, was the author wrong? Well, if the ex said they were breaking up and wanted to be friends, then the author had a right to believe the relationship was over. In that case, moving on and seeing other people isn't cheating if they're not in a relationship anymore. The ex's test adds a twist here because the ex didn't communicate their intentions properly. The author didn't know it was a test, so they acted based on the information they had. The ex's anger might be more about their own actions (using a test without clear communication) than the author's actions. The author might have been in the right to move on after a breakup, even if it hurt their feelings.\n\nWait, but some might argue that if the ex still had feelings and was testing the waters, maybe the author acted too quickly. But since the ex didn't clarify and the author thought it was a real breakup, the author's actions were reasonable. The mistake here might be on the ex's part for manipulating the situation without clear communication. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
