TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.\n\nSo, my lovely people of reddit. Any advice? AITA? \n\n\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend (supposedly) breaks up with me, I sleep with new people, he gets mad.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with new people after a breakup that they believed was real. The guy later says it was a test and is upset she moved on.\n\nFirst, the key point here is consent and communication. The author thought they were broken up, so from her perspective, there was no relationship anymore. She didn't have any obligation to stay faithful if the relationship was truly over. But then the guy claims it was a test, which complicates things. \n\nHowever, the guy was the one who initiated the breakup, so he's the one who should have been clear about his intentions. If he was testing her loyalty, he's being manipulative. The author acted based on the information she had at the time. She didn't know it was a test, so she made decisions based on her understanding of the situation. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If one person is using a breakup as a test, they're not being honest. The author's mistake was perhaps not ensuring that the breakup was mutual and clear. But since the guy was the one who initiated and said they were just friends, she had a right to move on. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted on the assumption that the relationship was over. The problem lies with the guy's deceptive behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
