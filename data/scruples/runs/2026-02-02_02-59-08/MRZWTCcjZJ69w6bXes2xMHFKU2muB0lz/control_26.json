Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with the fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They decided to use that money for a project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room. The house is their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. They hired a contractor, started construction, which involved tearing down walls and digging up the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's irresponsible, and they should have used the money for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The argument escalated, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the wedding.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author has the legal right to modify their own property. They used their own bonus money, which they describe as \"found\" money. But the fianc\u00e9 is part of the relationship and might feel that major financial decisions should be discussed, especially since they're getting married. Even though the author owns the house, the construction is affecting the living situation, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there. The key issue here is communication and shared financial planning in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, major purchases or investments that affect shared living spaces often require mutual agreement. The author didn't discuss the project with the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, which could be seen as dismissive of their partner's concerns. The fianc\u00e9's arguments about using the money for practical purposes like debt, wedding expenses, or savings are valid considerations. The author's stance that it's their house and their money might overlook the partnership aspect. \n\nHowever, the author did use their personal bonus, which they might consider their own. But since they're engaged, financial decisions can become shared responsibilities. The sudden, large-scale renovation without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. Even though legally the author has the right, emotionally and relationally, it's about compromise. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she's moved out and considering ending the engagement suggests that the author didn't consider her perspective, leading to significant conflict.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether using personal funds for a personal project without considering the partner's input is acceptable in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction indicates that it's not just about the money but about respecting each other's priorities and planning for the future together. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the decision beforehand, despite the legal ownership of the house and bonus.\n"
