Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for using their bonus to build a secret room, causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9e. The author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while, used it for this project, and now the fianc\u00e9e is upset.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright since it was given by their grandma. Legally, they can do what they want with their property. But the relationship aspect is tricky. They're engaged, and major financial decisions should ideally be discussed together. The fianc\u00e9e feels the bonus should have been used for shared goals like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author thinks it's \"found money\" and wants to use it for a personal dream.\n\nMarriage involves shared financial responsibilities. Even if the house is the author's, big changes like this affect the partner. The contractor work has made the house uninhabitable, which is a significant issue for the fianc\u00e9e. The fact that she moved in with her sister shows how much this is affecting their life together.\n\nThe author might not see the issue because they own the house, but relationships require communication and compromise. The key points are: using a bonus without discussing, significant changes to the home affecting both partners, and the potential impact on their wedding plans. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about financial planning and shared responsibilities are valid. The author's actions, while legally okay, might be seen as selfish in the relationship context.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e on a major financial decision that affects their shared life. Even if it's their house, the relationship's future is at stake. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
