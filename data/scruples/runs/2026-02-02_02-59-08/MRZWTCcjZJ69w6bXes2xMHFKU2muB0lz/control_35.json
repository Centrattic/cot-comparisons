Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in the house, which caused a big fight with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus from their new job. They own the house outright, given by their grandma, so they have legal authority. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the bonus for debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is now considering breaking off the wedding and has moved out.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in a relationship. Even though the house is the author's, they're engaged, so major financial decisions should be discussed. Using a five-figure bonus on a personal project without consulting the partner might be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are about debt and wedding costs, which are shared expenses. The author's defense is that it's their house and the money was a one-time bonus. But in a committed relationship, especially when planning a wedding, big expenditures might need mutual agreement. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels this so strongly that she's moving out suggests a significant breach of trust or communication. The author might not be legally wrong, but they're being inconsiderate. The answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
