Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author got a job after being out of steady work for years and received a five-figure bonus. They used this bonus to create a secret room in their house with a bookshelf door and a basement. The house was given to them by their grandma, paid off, so they own it outright and have full legal authority. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinking it's irresponsible because the money could have been used for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found\" money that might not come again and that it's their house. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved in with her sister and might end the engagement.\n\nFirst, the author does own the house, so legally they can make changes. But the issue is the relationship conflict. The key points are communication and considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective. The bonus was unexpected, but it's not like it's free money without any responsibility. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding with the project, which is a big deal, especially when it affects their living situation and major financial decisions. Even though the author has the right to use the bonus as they like, relationships require mutual decision-making, especially when it's about shared life (like a wedding, debts, and living arrangements). The fianc\u00e9 feels that the author's actions are irresponsible and disregard their financial plans. The author's stance is that it's their money and house, but in a relationship, especially when planning to get married, such a large expense should be discussed. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. The author's actions led to significant stress and potential end of the relationship. So, even though the author isn't legally wrong, the social/relational aspect suggests they are at fault for not involving their partner in the decision.\n"
