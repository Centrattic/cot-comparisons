Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author got a big bonus from a new job and decided to spend it on creating a secret room in their house with a bookshelf door and a basement. The fianc\u00e9 is really upset about this, thinking it's irresponsible and causing their wedding plans to be in trouble. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want with it.\n\nHmm, first, the author did use their own bonus money, which they might have seen as a windfall. But the fianc\u00e9 is part of the household, right? So even though the house is in the author's name, they're living together. The author made a big decision that affected the house structure, which their fianc\u00e9 is now struggling to live in. That seems like a problem because it's a shared living space, even if the author owns it. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's concerns are about financial responsibility. She wants to pay off debt, reduce the wedding's financial burden on her parents, or save the money. The author thinks it's a one-time bonus and they should enjoy it. But in a long-term relationship like marriage, especially with big expenses involved, maybe it's important to discuss shared financial goals. The author didn't consult her, which might be the issue. \n\nEven though the author has legal authority over the house, major renovations can affect the value or structure. Plus, if the fianc\u00e9 can't live in the house because of the disruption, that's a big deal. The contractor is tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. That's not just a small project; it's a significant construction effort that could make the house uninhabitable for a period or cause stress. \n\nSo, the key points are: using bonus money on a personal project without discussing with fianc\u00e9, major home renovations causing living issues, and the potential impact on their relationship and wedding plans. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective or involve her in the decision-making process. Financial decisions, even if they're on the author's own money, can affect the relationship, especially when it comes to major life events like a wedding. Plus, the structural changes are making the house hard to live in, which is a problem for both of them. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They made a choice that affects their partner without including her in the conversation, and that's probably the main issue here. Even if the money was theirs, the way they handled it and the impact on their partner's well-being and the wedding is problematic. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is strong, which suggests that the author's actions were a major breach in communication and financial planning, which are crucial in a marriage.\n"
