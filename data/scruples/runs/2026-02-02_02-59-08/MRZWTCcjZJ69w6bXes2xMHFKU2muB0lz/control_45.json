Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person used their bonus money to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from their new job. They didn't have a steady job for years before that, so this might be a windfall. They wanted a secret room for a long time and decided to use the bonus for that. The house is owned outright by the author, given by their grandma, so legally, they can do whatever they want with it. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9 is upset. She argues that the bonus should have been used more responsibly, like paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. The author thinks the bonus is \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved in with her sister and might call off the wedding. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the key points. The author had the financial autonomy to spend the bonus as they like since it's their money. However, they're engaged, which is a significant commitment. Financial decisions that affect shared life can be a gray area. Even though the house is the author's, major renovations can impact the fianc\u00e9's living situation. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which might be a problem in a committed relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid too. Using a large sum for a personal project when there are other financial obligations (like wedding costs) might be seen as irresponsible. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nBut the author's argument is that the bonus was a one-time thing. They might not get another bonus like that, so they wanted to use it for a personal dream. The house is theirs, so legally, they have the right. However, relationships require compromise. Not discussing such a big expense with a fianc\u00e9 could be seen as selfish, even if it's their money. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author acted responsibly in the context of a relationship. Since the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement, the author's actions, while legally justified, might be socially or morally wrong in the context of their relationship. The author didn't take into account the fianc\u00e9's financial priorities and the impact on their shared plans. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though they have the legal right to spend the bonus, relationships require communication and consideration of each other's needs. The author didn't discuss the plan with their fianc\u00e9, leading to major conflict over something significant that affects their shared future.\n"
