Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took a bonus from a job and used it to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They own the house outright, as it was given to them by their grandma when she passed. The plan is to build a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible, especially since they could have used the money for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, and since it's their house, they have the right to do what they want.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. Legally, the author owns the house and the bonus is their money, so they have the right to use it as they see fit. However, the relationship aspect is crucial here. The fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because she's upset. The key points are: communication, shared financial planning, and respect for the partner's priorities.\n\nThe author might be seen as not considering the fianc\u00e9's concerns. Even though the bonus is their money, major financial decisions in a relationship should ideally involve discussion, especially when it affects shared plans like a wedding or debt. The author's actions have made the house temporarily uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which adds to the conflict. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that the money could have been used for more urgent or shared priorities, like the wedding or debt, which are important in a committed relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they have the right to spend their own money as they choose, especially on a personal dream. However, the fact that this decision is causing such significant strain on the relationship suggests that the author might not have considered how this choice would impact their partner. The author's response that it's their house doesn't address the partner's emotional and financial concerns.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to get married, financial decisions can be a sensitive area. While the author isn't legally in the wrong, the social and relational expectations might weigh more here. The fianc\u00e9's feelings of being disregarded and the potential consequences of the engagement breaking up suggest that the author might be at fault for not discussing the decision beforehand and not compromising.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be the asshole for not including the fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process and for disregarding her priorities, even though the money is theirs. Relationships require compromise, and major spending decisions should consider both partners' needs and plans.\n"
