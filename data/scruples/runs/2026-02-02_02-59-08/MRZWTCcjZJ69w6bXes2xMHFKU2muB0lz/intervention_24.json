Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author received a bonus, which they consider \"found money\" because it's a one-time thing. They used it for a personal project without consulting their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author owns the house outright, so legally they can do this. However, the project is causing significant disruption to their home and the fianc\u00e9's living situation, leading to her moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are financial responsibility and communication. Even though the author legally has the right to use the bonus as they see fit, the decision affects their partner. Marriage involves shared financial decisions, and a large project like this without discussion could be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding expenses are valid, especially if they had prior agreements or expectations about using bonuses for shared goals.\n\nThe author's actions have caused major stress and potentially a breakup. While the bonus was a personal achievement, using it for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective might be seen as inconsiderate. The disruption to the house and the fianc\u00e9's ability to live there compounds the issue. Even if the money is \"found,\" the impact on the relationship is significant.\n\nSo, even though the author isn't legally wrong, ethically, they might be in the wrong for not discussing the use of the bonus with their fianc\u00e9, especially in the context of a future marriage. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the decision caused harm to the relationship despite legal ownership of the house.\n"
