Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a major conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a significant bonus after landing a good job. They used this money to start a project to build a secret room. The house is owned by the author, so they have legal authority. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't consult her, used the bonus irresponsibly in her view, and the construction made the house uninhabitable, leading her to move out and consider breaking off the engagement.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus was unexpected and a one-time opportunity, so they wanted to use it for a fun project. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that they should have discussed it together, considering shared financial goals like paying off debt or wedding expenses.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are communication, shared financial planning, and the impact on their relationship. Even though the author has the legal right to modify their house, relationships often require mutual agreement, especially when it affects shared living spaces and financial decisions. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that major financial decisions should be discussed as a couple, especially since they're planning to get married. The author didn't consult her, leading to a significant financial commitment that affects their future plans.\n\nThe construction making the house uninhabitable is another point. Even if it's the author's house, such a project would impact their shared living situation. The fianc\u00e9 moving out complicates things further, suggesting the decision had serious consequences on their relationship.\n\nIn relationship ethics, major financial decisions that impact both partners should be discussed. The author's action of using a large portion of a bonus without discussion could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns and priorities. While the bonus is a personal windfall, the context of a committed engagement implies shared financial responsibilities and planning. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement because of this decision underscores the severity of the breach in communication and mutual respect.\n\nTherefore, even though the author had the legal right and the bonus was a one-time thing, the failure to communicate and consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective likely makes them at fault here. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
