Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person using their bonus money to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big argument with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from their new job. They wanted a secret room, so they used the bonus for that. The house is their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. The contractor is tearing down walls and digging the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying the bonus was irresponsible to use, and they could have used the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, and they wanted to have fun with it. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved out and might call off the wedding.\n\nHmm. So, the author is making a decision that affects their shared living space and future plans. Even though it's the author's house, the fianc\u00e9 is deeply involved in their life. Financial decisions in a relationship usually require communication and mutual agreement. The author might have thought they were using their own bonus, but since they're engaged, expecting to merge finances, maybe they should have discussed it first. \n\nThe author says it's their house, but if the fianc\u00e9 is living there and the project is making it impossible for her to live in the house, that's a problem. Even if the house is owned by the author, renovations that affect cohabitation should consider the partner's comfort and needs. \n\nAlso, the bonus might be a one-time thing, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's necessary for other financial obligations. The author's argument is about using \"found money,\" but if the couple is planning to marry, they might have shared financial goals. Not discussing the use of the bonus could be seen as not respecting the partner's perspective. \n\nSo, even though the author had the legal right to use their money and make changes to their own house, in a relationship, major financial decisions that impact both partners should be discussed. Failing to communicate and causing a rift over something that affects their future together could be the author's fault. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement suggests the author didn't consider her feelings or priorities enough. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their plans and considered their own desires over the shared financial and emotional needs of the relationship.\n"
