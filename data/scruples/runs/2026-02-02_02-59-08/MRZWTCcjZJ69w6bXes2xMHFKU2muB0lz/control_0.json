Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after a long period of being unemployed. They own the house outright, inherited from their grandma. They went ahead and started a big renovation project without consulting their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is angry because she thinks it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. She wanted to use the bonus to pay off debt, help with the wedding expenses, or save. The author argues that the bonus is \"found money\" that might not come again, and it's their house, so they can do what they want.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication, financial responsibility in a relationship, and respect for each other's priorities. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is part of a serious relationship\u2014engaged, even. Major financial decisions, especially those involving shared assets or affecting the property they might live in together, should probably be discussed beforehand. \n\nThe author might have thought it was their money, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, financial planning typically involves both partners. The fact that the project made the fianc\u00e9 feel like she couldn't live in the house anymore adds to the tension. It's not just about the money; it's about how the decision was made unilaterally, causing significant stress and possibly damaging the relationship.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify their own property, the social and relational implications are important. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because major life decisions should be made with mutual agreement, especially when they impact both people's future. The author didn't consider her priorities and the potential shared financial goals, which is a key aspect of a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not discussing this with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding.\n"
