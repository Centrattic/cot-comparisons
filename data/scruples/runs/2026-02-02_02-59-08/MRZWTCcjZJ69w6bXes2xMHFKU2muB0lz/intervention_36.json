Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author received a bonus, which they consider \"found money.\" They used it to hire a contractor to build the secret room. The house is owned by the author outright, given from their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding. The project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading her to move out and consider ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and respecting each other's priorities. The author might think they're just using their money as they please, but since they're engaged, major financial decisions might require discussion. Even though the house is the author's, making such a big change that affects the fianc\u00e9's living situation could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without her input, leading to conflict. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the author has the legal right to modify the house, the relationship aspect is key here. In a pre-marital relationship, major expenditures and home renovations affecting both partners should ideally be mutual decisions. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and the impact on their wedding plans are valid. Even if the bonus is considered a windfall, using it for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective can be seen as selfish. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue it's their money and their house. But being engaged adds a layer of shared future planning. The fact that the project is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 is a significant issue. So, while the author isn't legally wrong, they might be at fault relationally for not discussing the decision and considering the fianc\u00e9's needs and the shared financial goals. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
