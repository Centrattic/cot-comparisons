Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus from a job they just landed. The bonus is described as five figures, which is a significant amount. They used this money to create a secret room, which is a personal desire. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the money should have been used more responsibly, like paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 is now so upset that she moved out and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bonus wasn't discussed beforehand. The author decided to use the money for a personal project without involving their partner. The project is extensive (digging foundations, tearing walls), which makes the house uninhabitable for the partner. The author owns the house but the partner is also part of the relationship, so major decisions affecting shared living spaces should probably be mutual.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's their house and the bonus was their money. However, in a long-term relationship, especially nearing marriage, financial decisions of this magnitude usually require agreement. The partner feels disrespected and unheard, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. The fact that the project is causing them to not live in the house exacerbates the issue.\n\nThe author's actions led to a situation where the relationship is in jeopardy. Even if the bonus is technically their money, the way it was handled\u2014without discussion\u2014caused significant stress and conflict. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because financial planning in a relationship is about shared responsibilities and future plans. The author's unilateral decision to spend the bonus on a personal whim, despite the partner's concerns, shows a lack of consideration for the relationship's stability.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and consider their partner's perspective, leading to a major conflict. The answer should be A.\n"
