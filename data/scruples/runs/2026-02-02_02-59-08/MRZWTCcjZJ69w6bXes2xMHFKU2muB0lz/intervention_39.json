Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a bonus from a new job being used to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being out of work for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which they've always wanted. The house is owned by the author's grandma and now them, so they have legal rights. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, especially since they're getting married. She wants the money used for debts, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, shared financial decisions, and respect. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is part of their life now. Using a significant bonus without discussing it might have been a mistake. The author says they didn't discuss it, which is a problem. Relationships require mutual decision-making, especially when it comes to finances. The fianc\u00e9 feels her needs (wedding, debt) are being ignored. The secret room is a personal project, but when it affects their shared life (moving in with her sister, considering ending the wedding), it's a bigger issue than just ownership.\n\nThe author might not be legally wrong, but ethically, they may have failed to consider their partner's perspective. The bonus was a joint financial asset, even if it's the author's income. Major projects that change the house structure impact both partners. The author's actions caused the fianc\u00e9 to feel disrespected and undervalued, leading to severe consequences. So, while the author's desire for a secret room is understandable, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's viewpoint makes them at least partially in the wrong. \n\nAnswer: A.\n"
