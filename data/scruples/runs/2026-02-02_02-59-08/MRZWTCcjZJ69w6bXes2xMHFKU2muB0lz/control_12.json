Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big argument with their fianc\u00e9. The key points here seem to be about responsibility with money, communication, and how the project is affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author used a bonus that was a one-time, five-figure amount. They argue it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they want to spend it on something fun. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She also mentions the physical changes to the house making it hard for her to live there now. \n\nThe author owns the house outright, so legally, they can make modifications. But this is about their relationship. The main issue here is that the author made a significant financial decision without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9, who is clearly important to them. Even though the author might have the legal right to do what they did, in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married, major financial decisions should be mutual. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she moved out and is considering ending the engagement suggests that the author didn't consider her feelings or the impact on their future together.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's their house and the bonus money was a one-time thing. But in a relationship, especially when you're engaged, big expenditures that affect shared living space should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and the wedding are valid, and ignoring her input could be seen as selfish. The author might not be wrong in wanting to enjoy the bonus, but they failed to communicate and consider their partner's perspective. That lack of communication likely contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily doing something illegal or unethical in terms of the house ownership, the way they handled the situation\u2014without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9\u2014has caused significant harm to their relationship. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong because they didn't respect their partner's needs and the collaborative nature of their future together.\n"
