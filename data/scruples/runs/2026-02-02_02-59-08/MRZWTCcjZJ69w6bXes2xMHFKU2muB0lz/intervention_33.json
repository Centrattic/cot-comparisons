Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their shared house, leading to a major conflict with their partner, who is now considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the story. The author received a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They decided to use this money to build a secret room, which involved significant structural changes to the house. The house was inherited from the author's grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, feeling that the author was irresponsible, and the project has made the house uninhabitable for her. They're now in a serious conflict, with the fianc\u00e9 moving in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time opportunity, so they wanted to use it for fun. The fianc\u00e9 argues that it was irresponsible and that the money could have been used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The main issue here seems to be a disagreement over financial priorities and the impact of the project on their relationship.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author owns the house and used their own money for a personal project. They might feel entitled to make such decisions. On the other hand, they're in a committed relationship with a fianc\u00e9, and major financial decisions that affect their shared living space should probably involve mutual discussion and agreement. Even though the bonus was a personal windfall, the decision to undertake a project that alters the house in a way that makes it uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 seems to disregard her feelings and their shared future. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement suggests that the author's actions have caused significant harm to the relationship.\n\nThe key here is communication and considering the partner's perspective. Even if the author had the legal right to make the changes, the emotional and practical impact on the fianc\u00e9 is substantial. The author might not have considered the fianc\u00e9's needs and priorities, leading to a breakdown in trust and cooperation. In relationships, especially when planning to marry, major decisions that affect both partners should be made collaboratively. The author's dismissal of the fianc\u00e9's concerns as \"irresponsible\" could come off as dismissive of her valid worries about their financial stability and shared goals.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily legally wrong (since it's their house and their money), the emotional and relational consequences suggest that they didn't handle the situation well. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is understandable given the stress and upheaval caused by the project. The author might be in the wrong for not discussing the project with the fianc\u00e9 first and for not considering the impact on their relationship.\n"
