Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that they used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door, so they hired a contractor and started construction. The house is their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking the bonus was misused, and the author's arguments are that it's \"found money\" and their house.\n\nNow, the author's perspective: They see this as a fun project using bonus money that might not come again. The house is theirs, so they have the legal right to modify it. They argue it's their choice. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective: She's upset because the money could have been used for paying debt, the wedding, or saving. The construction is making the house uninhabitable for her, leading her to move out. The tension is so high that the engagement might be off.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, the author has the right to modify their house. Financially, using a bonus for a personal project isn't illegal, but relationship-wise, it's more complicated. The main issue here is the relationship conflict. Even if the author has the legal right, financial decisions in a relationship often require communication and mutual agreement, especially when the partner is significantly affected. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e, leading to a breakdown in trust and communication. The construction also impacts the living situation, causing her to move out. \n\nThe bonus is considered \"found money,\" but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions should be discussed. The author might not be wrong legally, but relationally, they made a decision that caused significant distress. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, and ignoring those in favor of a personal project without discussion is where the author might be at fault. \n\nSo, while the author's actions are legal and maybe understandable as a dream project, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's priorities and the impact on their shared life could make them the asshole. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the issue is the relationship aspect, not just the legal or financial side.\n"
