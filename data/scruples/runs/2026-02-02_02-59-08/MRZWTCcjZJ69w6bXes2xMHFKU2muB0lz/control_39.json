Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work, received a bonus. They wanted a secret room and used the bonus for that. The house is owned outright by the author. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for more practical things like paying off debt or the wedding, and the construction is making the house uninhabitable. The fianc\u00e9 moved out, considering ending the engagement.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nThe author argues it's \"found money\" from a one-time bonus. Using bonuses for personal projects isn't unheard of, but the context is that they're getting married. Marriages often involve shared financial decisions. The fianc\u00e9 feels this was a unilateral decision without discussion, which is a big issue in relationships. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations affecting the living space would impact both partners. \n\nAlso, the construction making the house impossible to live in shows that the project has significant logistical issues. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for shared goals like the wedding or debt are valid. The author didn't consult, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nWhile the author has the legal right to renovate the house, the relationship aspect is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's anger is about the lack of mutual planning and the financial prioritization. The author might not be legally wrong, but in a relationship, especially pre-marriage, financial decisions should be mutual. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't discuss major financial and home renovation decisions with their fianc\u00e9, leading to significant conflict and potential relationship damage. The failure to communicate and consider the partner's perspective, even with personal funds, is a key factor in the relationship context.\n"
