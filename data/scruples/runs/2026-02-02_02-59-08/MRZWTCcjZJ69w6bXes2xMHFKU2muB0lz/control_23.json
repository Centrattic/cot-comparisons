Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author used their bonus to start a project on their house. They note that the house was inherited from their grandma and they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't consult her about the bonus usage, which she argues could have been used for shared financial goals like paying off debt or the wedding. The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" and wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement due to the conflict and the disruption caused by the construction.\n\nSo, the key points are: ownership of the house, use of personal bonus, lack of communication, and the impact on the relationship. The author owns the house, so legally they can make changes. However, the main issue is the relationship aspect. Even though the bonus is the author's, a significant life decision affecting both partners should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 feels ignored and disrespected, leading to a major fallout. While the author may have the right to use their money and the house as they see fit, the manner in which they did it without consulting their partner is problematic. In a relationship, financial decisions, especially large ones, typically require mutual agreement to maintain trust and partnership. The author's actions might not be \"wrong\" in a legal sense, but in a relational context, it's a breach of communication and consideration, which often leads to AITA situations. So, likely, the answer is A (author is the asshole) because the main issue is the lack of discussion and the impact on the relationship despite legal ownership.\n"
