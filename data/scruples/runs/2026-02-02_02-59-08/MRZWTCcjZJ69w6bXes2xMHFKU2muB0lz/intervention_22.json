Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used their bonus to create a secret room in their house. The key points here are the financial aspect and the communication issues with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus, which they considered as \"found money\" since it might not happen again. They used this to hire a contractor to build a secret room. The house is owned by the author, so they have the legal right to make changes. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected to use the bonus for paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. The fianc\u00e9 feels that the author didn't consult them about this big expense, which led to a major conflict.\n\nThe main issue here seems to be communication and shared financial planning. Even though the bonus might be considered extra money, in a relationship, major financial decisions can affect both partners. The author might have thought it was their money to spend since it's their house, but a fianc\u00e9 is a significant other, and marriage implies shared responsibilities and discussions about finances. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this suggests that the lack of communication and consideration for each other's priorities is a big problem.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as self-centered because they didn't consider their fianc\u00e9's feelings or financial goals. Even if the bonus was a one-time thing, it's important to discuss such large expenditures when in a serious relationship. The construction also made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which added to the stress and conflict. So, while the author isn't legally at fault, the relational aspect is where the problem lies. Not involving the fianc\u00e9 in such a significant financial decision could be seen as irresponsible or inconsiderate, making the author at least partially in the wrong.\n"
