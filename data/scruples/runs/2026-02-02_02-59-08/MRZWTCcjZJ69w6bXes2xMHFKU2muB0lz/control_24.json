Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in the house, which led to a big argument with the fianc\u00e9 who's now considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They wanted a secret room, so they hired a contractor to modify the house. The author owns the house outright, as it was given by their grandma, so there's no mortgage. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because using the bonus was seen as irresponsible. She wanted the money for debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for fun. Now, the fianc\u00e9 can't live in the house because of the construction and is moving in with her sister, threatening the relationship.\n\nHmm. So, the main issues here are financial responsibility and communication. The author has the legal right to modify their own property, but the fianc\u00e9 feels this decision was made without proper discussion. Even though the house is owned by the author, the fianc\u00e9 is living there and the construction is affecting her. That's a big point. Maybe the author didn't consider how the renovation would impact their shared living space. \n\nAlso, the bonus, while unexpected, might be considered a shared financial resource if they're engaged and planning to merge finances. The author might have assumed they could spend it freely, but the fianc\u00e9 expected joint decision-making, especially on major projects. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is moving out and the relationship is at risk suggests that this wasn't just a minor disagreement but a significant breach of trust or communication. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bonus was a one-time opportunity, but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a missed chance to address financial obligations. Whether it's \"found money\" or not depends on their financial agreement. If they had a prior understanding about shared expenses, especially with wedding planning and debt, the author might have violated that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. Legally, they can do as they please with their own property and bonus. But in a relationship, major financial decisions and home renovations usually require mutual consent. The fact that the author proceeded without discussing it with the fianc\u00e9 could be seen as a mistake, especially when it's causing such a rift. The impact on their living situation and the fianc\u00e9's well-being is a key factor. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while they have legal rights, the financial decision and the renovation were made unilaterally without considering how it affects the relationship and the fianc\u00e9's needs. The communication breakdown seems to be a bigger issue here than the legality of the actions.\n"
