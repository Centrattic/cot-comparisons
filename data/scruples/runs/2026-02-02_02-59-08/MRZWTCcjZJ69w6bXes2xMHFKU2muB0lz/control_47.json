Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a bonus being used to create a secret room in a house, causing conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright since it was given to them by their grandma. So legally, they can make modifications. They used a bonus which they consider \"found money\" for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to be used for shared goals like debt, wedding costs, or saving. \n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author didn't discuss the project with their fianc\u00e9 beforehand, which is a big issue. Even though the author owns the house, making such a significant change without discussing it with a partner, especially one they're engaged to, can strain the relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is that the bonus should have been a joint financial decision. Using it for a personal project without consulting them could be seen as selfish. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. \n\nWhile the author's actions might be legally justified, relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author's decision to proceed without considering their partner's input and the impact on their shared future likely contributes to the conflict. So, even if the author isn't legally wrong, they're at fault in the relationship aspect.\n"
