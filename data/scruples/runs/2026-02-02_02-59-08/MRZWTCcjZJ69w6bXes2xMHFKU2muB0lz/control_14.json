Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. The project has caused a lot of stress, to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved out and they might break up.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house, so legally, they can do what they want with it. But the problem is the financial decision and the impact on their relationship. The bonus was a one-time thing, and they argue it's \"found money.\" However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that major financial decisions should be mutual, especially since they're getting married. The project is causing them to live separately, which is a big deal.\n\nSo, while the author might not be wrong legally, the issue is about financial responsibility and communication. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they should discuss and agree on big expenses, especially when it's a shared life. The author didn't consult them, leading to conflict. Even though the bonus is the author's, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions might be expected to be discussed. The project's disruption (tearing down walls, making the house uninhabitable) adds to the problem. The author might be seen as not considering their partner's concerns and the relationship's stability. So, the answer could be AITA, meaning the author is the asshole.\n"
