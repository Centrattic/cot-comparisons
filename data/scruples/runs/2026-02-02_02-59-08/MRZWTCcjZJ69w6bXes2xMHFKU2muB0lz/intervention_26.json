Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person using their bonus to build a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus from a new job that they hadn't had in years. They used this money to create a secret room with a bookshelf door and a new basement. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible because the money could have been used for other things like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not happen again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved in with her sister and might end the engagement.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are communication, financial responsibility, and mutual expectations in a relationship. The author mentions they own the house, so legally they can do what they want. But relationships aren't just about legal stuff. They involve partnership and shared decisions, especially when it's a significant amount of money and affects the living situation. The author used the bonus without discussing it, which is a red flag. They also made structural changes that made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which is a big deal. Even though the money was the author's, big purchases that affect the relationship should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and future planning are valid. The author's argument that it's \"found money\" might not hold weight if it's causing major relationship issues. So, the author probably didn't consider their partner's feelings and priorities, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
