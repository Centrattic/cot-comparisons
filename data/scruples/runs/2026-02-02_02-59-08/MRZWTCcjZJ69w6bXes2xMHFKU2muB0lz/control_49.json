Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involves significant renovations. The house was given to them by their grandma, paid off, so they own it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think it's irresponsible, arguing the money could have been used for debt, wedding expenses, or savings. She's so upset she moved out and might call off the wedding.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. They also own the house, so they feel they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9's side is about financial responsibility and shared planning for their future together, especially since they're getting married. \n\nKey points: The author didn't discuss the use of the bonus with their fianc\u00e9 beforehand? The renovations are making the house uninhabitable for her. Even though the house is the author's, major renovations would affect their shared living situation. Also, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a major decision that should have been mutual, especially as they're planning to marry. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship often require communication and mutual agreement. Even if the bonus was a one-time thing, using it for a personal project without considering the fianc\u00e9's concerns might be seen as selfish. The fact that the renovations are causing her to leave the house adds to the problem. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that it's their money and their house. But since they're engaged, financial decisions can impact both partners. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and savings are valid long-term considerations. The author didn't consider those, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the lack of discussion and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's perspective. Even if the author had the legal right to renovate the house, the emotional and practical impact on their partner is significant. The decision to use the bonus without consulting the fianc\u00e9 first seems to be a key factor in the conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving their partner in such a major decision that affects their shared life.\n"
