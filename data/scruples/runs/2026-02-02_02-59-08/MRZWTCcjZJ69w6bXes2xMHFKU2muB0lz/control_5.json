Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement staircase. They own the house outright since it was given by their grandma, so they have legal authority. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, as they could have used the money for debt, wedding expenses, or savings. The argument is so bad that she moved in with her sister and might call off the wedding.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's defense is that the bonus is \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to have fun with it. But the fianc\u00e9e feels this was a decision that should have involved both of them, especially since they're planning to get married. The fact that she can't live in the house anymore because of the construction is a big deal. \n\nI should consider the relationship aspect. The author is engaged, so they're in a committed relationship. Even though they own the house, major renovations can affect the fianc\u00e9e's comfort and the shared living space. Financial decisions, especially large ones, often require mutual agreement when you're engaged, even if it's your own property. The author might not have consulted their fianc\u00e9e, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. \n\nAlso, the bonus was a one-time thing. The author argues it's not regular income, but the fianc\u00e9e feels it's irresponsible not to use it for shared goals like the wedding or debt. The author's desire for a fun project is understandable, but the lack of communication is a problem. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme, but the author's unilateral decision might have contributed to the situation. \n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and relationship impact is significant. The answer likely hinges on whether the author should have discussed the decision with their fianc\u00e9e beforehand. Since they're getting married, financial planning is part of the commitment. The author not involving their partner in a major financial decision could be seen as the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because they didn't communicate and consider their fianc\u00e9e's perspective, even if the action is legally allowed.\n"
