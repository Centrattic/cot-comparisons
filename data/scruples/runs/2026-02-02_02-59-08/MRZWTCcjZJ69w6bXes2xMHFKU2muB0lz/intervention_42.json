Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author used a bonus to create a secret room, which upset their fianc\u00e9. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and wants to discuss financial decisions together.\n\nHmm. The author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" and they have the right to use it as they like. But the fianc\u00e9 is part of the relationship and expected joint decision-making. Even though the house is the author's, major renovations affecting the entire house might impact the fianc\u00e9's comfort and future plans. The fact that she's moved out and considering breaking off the engagement suggests the issue goes beyond just money\u2014it's about respect for each other's priorities and communication.\n\nSo, legally, the author isn't wrong. But in terms of relationship dynamics, they might have overlooked their partner's feelings and the importance of discussing large financial commitments together. The secret room project caused significant stress, which is a big deal. While the author had the legal right, not consulting the fianc\u00e9 on such a major expense could be seen as selfish or dismissive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and the potential impact on their relationship.\n"
