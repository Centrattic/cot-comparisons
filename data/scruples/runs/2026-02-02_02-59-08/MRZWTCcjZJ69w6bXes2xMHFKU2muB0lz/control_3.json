Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big argument with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a bonus from a new job, which they view as \"found money.\" They used it to build a secret room, which is a significant home renovation. The partner is upset because they think the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they can make changes. However, the renovation is causing the house to be uninhabitable for the partner, leading to her moving out and possibly ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility and communication. The author's defense is that the bonus is a one-time thing and they have the right to spend it as they wish, especially since it's their house. The partner feels it's irresponsible and that major financial decisions should be mutual, especially since they're getting married. \n\nLegally, the author isn't wrong because they own the house. But relationships often require compromise and discussion about shared finances, even if one person has their own money. The secret room is a personal desire, but the execution caused significant disruption. The partner might feel disrespected because the decision was made without considering their input, even if the money is the author's. Also, using the bonus for such a project when there are other financial priorities (like the wedding) could be seen as selfish, especially in a committed relationship where both parties' needs and future plans are important.\n\nThe fact that the renovation is making the house uninhabitable adds another layer. Even if it's the author's house, not considering the partner's living situation during such a major project could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have assumed they had the right to make the changes without consulting their fianc\u00e9, but in a relationship, especially a long-term one like a marriage, major decisions affecting both partners should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9's anger is understandable because it's not just about the money but also about the impact on their shared life and the wedding plans.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspects suggest that they might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate properly and didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared future. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because despite ownership of the house and the bonus, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's concerns is a relationship issue that contributes to the problem.\n"
