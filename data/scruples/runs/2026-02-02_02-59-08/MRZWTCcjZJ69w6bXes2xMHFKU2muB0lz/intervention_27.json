Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple where the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after a long time without steady work. They used this money to build a secret room by tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they should have used the money for things like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they had the right to do it. Now the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations that affect the entire structure can impact the living situation of a partner. Plus, using a bonus that's part of shared financial planning in a serious relationship (engaged) without discussing it first seems like a misstep. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, especially if they were planning together. The author's action of proceeding without discussion might have been a breach of trust, even if the money was their bonus. Relationships often require compromise, so not considering the partner's perspective could be seen as selfish. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate and considered their own desires over the fianc\u00e9's priorities, leading to significant conflict.\n"
