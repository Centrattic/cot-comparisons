Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The author received a significant bonus after a period of unemployment and used it for a personal project. They own the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The project has also made the house uninhabitable for her, leading her to move out and consider ending the engagement.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has the right to use their bonus as they see fit. The house is their property, so modifications are permissible. However, relationships involve more than just legal rights; they require communication and mutual understanding. The author didn't discuss the project with their fianc\u00e9 beforehand, which is a big factor here. Even though it's their money and house, major projects that affect shared living spaces should ideally be discussed with a partner, especially when planning to get married. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and the immediate impact on their living situation are valid. The author's dismissal of her concerns as \"irresponsible\" might come off as dismissive of her valid financial worries. \n\nThe fact that the project has made the house impossible for the fianc\u00e9 to live in exacerbates the issue. It's not just about spending money but also about disrupting their shared life. The author might have acted impulsively without considering how it affects the relationship. While the bonus could be seen as \"found money,\" the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's perspective is where the author could be in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did use their own money for a personal dream, which isn't inherently wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be over the top if the author had communicated their intentions earlier. However, since the situation has caused such a severe rift, the author's failure to involve their partner in the decision-making is a significant oversight. In relationships, especially when marriage is involved, major financial decisions should be discussed. The author's actions, while legally sound, lack the collaborative approach expected in a committed partnership.\n\nSo, considering both the legal and relational aspects, the author's mistake was not discussing the project with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding. The fianc\u00e9's feelings about financial planning and the impact on their shared home are legitimate concerns. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for not involving their partner in such a significant decision, even if the action itself isn't illegal.\n"
