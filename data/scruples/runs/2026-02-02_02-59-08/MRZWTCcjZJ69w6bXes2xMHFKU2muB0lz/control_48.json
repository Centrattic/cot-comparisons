Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room with a contractor, tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal authority. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling it was irresponsible not to discuss the bonus usage together. She's considering calling off the wedding because they might have used the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not happen again, and it's their house.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility in a relationship and communication. Even though the author legally owns the house, relationships often involve shared financial decisions, especially when planning a wedding. The bonus was a significant amount, and the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint matter. The author didn't consult her, leading to a breakdown in trust. The project caused living difficulties, which adds to her distress. \n\nWhile the author has the right to spend their own money, the way it was done without discussion might be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns. Marriages require teamwork, and major financial decisions affecting the shared home should ideally be mutual. The fact that the project started without her input, leading to her moving out, suggests a lack of consideration for her feelings and the partnership. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as selfish, even if legally they're in the right. The key here is the communication breakdown and not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is the asshole) because they didn't discuss the decision and caused significant strain on the relationship.\n"
