Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project, a secret room. The partner is upset because they expected the money to be used for shared goals like paying off debt or wedding costs. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to use it as they wish.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has the legal right to modify their house, and the bonus might be seen as unexpected. However, in a relationship, especially one moving towards marriage, major financial decisions usually require discussion. The partner feels disrespected and excluded from the decision-making process. The project caused significant disruption to their home, which the partner can't live with anymore. The fact that they moved in with her sister and might break up shows the severity of the issue.\n\nThe key points are communication and shared responsibility in a relationship. Even if legally correct, not discussing such a significant expense with a partner, especially one planning marriage, can be seen as selfish. The author's actions led to a major conflict, so while they have their reasons, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings might make them the asshole here. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consult their partner on a major financial decision affecting their shared life.\n"
