Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They decided to use this money for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is owned by the author (from their grandma) and they hired a contractor to do the work. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the money could have been used for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The project has also disrupted their living situation, leading the fianc\u00e9 to move out and consider ending the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Even though the author owns the house and the bonus is their income, a significant life decision like this, especially one affecting a shared home, should involve the partner. The fianc\u00e9 feels excluded and hurt, which is a valid emotional response. While the author might see the bonus as \"found money,\" the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning and shared responsibilities are legitimate. The author didn't consult with their fianc\u00e9, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. \n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, major financial decisions should be made together. The author's unilateral decision, despite the fianc\u00e9's objections, contributes to the conflict. Even if the author has the legal right to make the changes, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The project's disruption (tore down walls, foundation work) affects their shared living space, making the situation more complex. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal sense, relationally, they failed to consider their partner's feelings and the importance of joint decision-making. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
