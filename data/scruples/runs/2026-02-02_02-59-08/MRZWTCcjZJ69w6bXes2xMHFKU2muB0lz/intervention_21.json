Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple where the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while, which they see as \"found money.\" They used it for a personal project, a secret room, without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they thought the money could be used for more responsible purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The project is causing significant structural changes to the house, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, and they're considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nSo, the main issues here are communication and shared financial responsibility. The author might argue that the bonus was a one-time thing and they had the right to spend it as they wished since it's their house. But the fianc\u00e9 feels that major financial decisions should be discussed, especially when it affects their shared living space and future plans.\n\nIn relationships, especially when engaged, financial decisions that have a big impact on both partners are usually expected to be mutual. Even though the author owns the house, making structural changes that affect their partner's comfort and the overall finances of their future marriage could be seen as not considering the partner's perspective. The fianc\u00e9's anger is justified because unexpected large expenses without discussion can lead to trust issues and conflict. The author might have acted impulsively without considering the fianc\u00e9's concerns and the broader implications on their relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not discussing the use of the bonus and proceeding with such a significant project unilaterally.\n"
