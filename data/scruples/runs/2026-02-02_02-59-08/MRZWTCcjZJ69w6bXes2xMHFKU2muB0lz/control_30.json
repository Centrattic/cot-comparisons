Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the author got a big bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think it's irresponsible and they could have used that money for other purposes like paying debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and the house is theirs, so they can do what they want with it.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that the bonus was unexpected and they own the house, so they have the right to modify it. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a shared responsibility since they're getting married. Even if the house is the author's, the project is affecting the entire living space, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there. Also, financial decisions in a relationship usually require communication and mutual agreement, especially when it's a large expenditure. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows how serious the conflict is. The author might not have consulted their fianc\u00e9 before making such a big decision, which can be seen as selfish. Even though the author owns the house, relationships involve compromise. So, while the author might not be legally wrong, emotionally and relationally, they might have overstepped. The answer likely leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared future.\n"
