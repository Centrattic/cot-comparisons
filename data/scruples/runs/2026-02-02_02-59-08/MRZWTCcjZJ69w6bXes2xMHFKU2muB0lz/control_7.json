Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The author got a five-figure bonus from their new job, which is great. They wanted to create a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement staircase, so they hired a contractor. Now, their fianc\u00e9 is really upset about it and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright, inherited from their grandma. So legally, they can do what they want with the property. But the issue isn't about legality; it's about the relationship. The fianc\u00e9 is angry because the bonus wasn't used for debt or wedding costs, and the construction is making the house uninhabitable. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the bonus was a one-time opportunity and they wanted to use it for a personal dream. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. In a relationship, especially when planning a future together, big financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is a partner in the relationship, and major renovations that affect their shared living space should probably be discussed. \n\nThe fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now moving out and the relationship is in jeopardy suggests that this decision had a significant impact. The author might have thought it was a personal project, but if their partner is living there, it affects both of them. The contractor work causing the house to be unusable is a practical problem too. \n\nSo, even though the author had the right to use their bonus, not communicating with their fianc\u00e9 about this big project probably made it seem dismissive of her concerns. The key point here is about shared financial responsibility and respect for the partner's feelings. The author might not be \"wrong\" legally, but in the context of their relationship, they might have failed to consider their fianc\u00e9's perspective, leading to her feeling disrespected or unheard. That could make them the asshole in the relationship context.\n"
