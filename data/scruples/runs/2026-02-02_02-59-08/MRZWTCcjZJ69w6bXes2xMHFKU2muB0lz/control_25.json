Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for a while. They wanted to build a secret room, hired a contractor, started tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinks it's irresponsible, and they're now considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, the author owns the house outright, inherited it from their grandma. They argue the bonus was \"found money\" and wanted to use it for fun. The fianc\u00e9 feels they should have discussed it and used the money for other priorities like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved out.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility, communication, and respect for each other's priorities. The author acted on their own without consulting the fianc\u00e9, even though they're engaged. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations that affect the structure would likely impact both partners, especially since they're planning to get married. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is that big financial decisions should be made together. The author's defense is that the bonus was a one-time thing and they wanted to use it for a personal project. But in a relationship, especially when engaged, financial decisions can be a shared responsibility. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's concerns beforehand, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. \n\nAlso, the renovation is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which adds practical stress. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" might not fully acknowledge that the fianc\u00e9 is part of their life now, and such a big project would affect both of them. \n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The key here is whether major financial decisions should be discussed in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests that this was a deal-breaker because of lack of communication and shared planning. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require compromise and mutual decision-making, especially when it comes to finances and major life projects. The author's actions, while understandable as a personal desire, didn't take into account the fianc\u00e9's priorities and feelings, leading to a serious conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process, which is crucial in a committed relationship. The bonus money was used without considering shared goals, which the fianc\u00e9 feels is irresponsible. Even if the money was a bonus, the way it was spent without discussion has caused significant harm to the relationship.\n"
