Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after a long period of unemployment. They own the house outright, inherited from their grandma, so they have legal right to modify it. The contractor has already started tearing walls and digging the foundation for a secret room with a bookshelf door. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinks it's irresponsible, and wants the money used for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not happen again, and that it's their house. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved in with her sister and the relationship might end.\n\nSo the main conflict is about the use of the bonus money and the modifications to the house. The author has legal authority, but the relationship aspect is more important here. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without her input, even though the author might not have discussed it. They are getting married, so big financial decisions should be mutual. Even if the author has the legal right, the emotional and relational impact is significant. The author's argument about \"found money\" might be valid, but the fianc\u00e9's concerns about shared responsibilities and planning are also valid. The fact that the work is already underway and making the house uninhabitable for her adds to the problem. It seems like the author didn't consider their partner's feelings and the shared future. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and used the funds without considering their fianc\u00e9's perspective.\n"
