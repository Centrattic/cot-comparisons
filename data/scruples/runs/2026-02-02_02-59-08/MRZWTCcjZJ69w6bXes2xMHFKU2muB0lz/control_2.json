Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, they got a bonus from a good job after being unemployed for a while. The bonus is described as \"found money\" they might not get again. They own the house outright, so legally they can do whatever they want. They hired a contractor, started renovations on the spare bedroom, which includes tearing walls and digging a foundation for a basement. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is furious, wants to call off the wedding. She argues that using the bonus was irresponsible\u2014they could have used the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. She also can't live in the house anymore because of the construction. The author says it's their house, so they can do as they please, but this has caused a major conflict.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared responsibility in a relationship and communication. Even though the author legally owns the house and the money is theirs, the fianc\u00e9 is involved in the life of the house and their future together. Using a significant amount of money for a personal project without discussing it with a partner, especially when there are financial goals or debts, can be seen as selfish. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now in a position where she can't live in the house and is considering ending the engagement suggests that the author didn't consider her needs or the impact on their relationship. \n\nWhile the author might not be legally wrong, in a relationship, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when the partner is affected by the outcome. The author's insistence that it's \"their house\" might overlook the fact that they're preparing to get married, which implies shared financial and living decisions. The fianc\u00e9 feels disrespected and her concerns about using the bonus for practical purposes versus a luxury project are valid. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate or consider their fianc\u00e9's perspective, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
