Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where one partner used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a significant bonus after being out of work for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which they've always wanted. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling it's irresponsible and that they should have used the money for more practical things like debt, wedding costs, or savings. She's even moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe house is owned by the author's grandma, given to them paid off, so they have legal authority. But the fianc\u00e9 feels this was a decision that should have been discussed. The key points here are communication and financial priorities. Even though the author has the legal right to modify the house, the relationship aspect is about mutual decision-making, especially when it's a shared home (though the author owns it). The fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid because major financial decisions affecting the home and their future together should be discussed. The author's actions caused a rift, leading to the potential end of the engagement. So while the author isn't legally wrong, their failure to communicate could be seen as a mistake in the relationship context. Hence, the answer might be A, but I need to check again. The author's argument is about using \"found money\" but the fianc\u00e9's perspective is about shared responsibilities. In relationships, even if it's your money, big projects impacting the partner's life should be discussed. So yes, the author is in the wrong for not discussing it first.\n"
