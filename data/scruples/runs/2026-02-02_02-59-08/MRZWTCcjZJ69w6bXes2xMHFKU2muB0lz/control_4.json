Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to build a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a bonus after being out of steady work, which is a significant amount (\"five figure\"). They used it to create a secret room, which involves structural changes to the house. The house was inherited from their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks spending the bonus was irresponsible, especially since they could have used the money for wedding expenses or paying off debt. She's so angry she's threatening to call off the wedding and has moved in with her sister.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author sees the bonus as \"found money\" and a one-time opportunity, so they wanted to use it for a fun project. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, values financial responsibility and planning for their future together. The author mentions it's their house, so they have the legal right to make changes, but the emotional and relational impact is huge.\n\nLegal ownership is on the author's side, but relationships involve more than just legal rights. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input wasn't considered, which is a big deal when planning a shared future. The secret room project caused immediate disruption (tearing down walls, making the house uninhabitable), which adds to her frustration. Even if the bonus is \"found money,\" using it in a way that affects their shared life plans without discussion could be seen as dismissive.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. They had the right to spend their bonus as they pleased, but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The fact that the project was done without the fianc\u00e9's input, leading to a breakdown in their relationship, suggests poor communication and disregard for her priorities. While the author might not be legally wrong, relationally, they are at fault for not discussing the decision beforehand, especially with a significant life event like a wedding on the horizon.\n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They should have discussed the bonus usage with their partner before making such a drastic decision, considering their shared financial goals and the impact on their relationship.\n"
