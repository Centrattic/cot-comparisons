Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house, which the fianc\u00e9 is really upset about. The key points to consider are the financial aspect, the communication between the couple, and the impact on their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want with it. But since they're engaged and planning to get married, this is a joint matter. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus money was used without discussing it with her. The bonus was a one-time thing, but the fianc\u00e9 argues that it could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding. The author sees it as \"found money\" to enjoy, but maybe the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible to spend such a large amount on a personal project when there are other financial priorities.\n\nCommunication seems to be a big issue here. Even though the author may have the legal right to spend the money, relationships require mutual agreement, especially on big financial decisions. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this suggests that the author didn't consider her perspective or feelings. The project has also made the house uninhabitable for her, which adds to her frustration.\n\nThe author might not be malicious, but they might be overlooking the importance of discussing major purchases with a partner, especially when the project affects the living space they both share. Even if the house is in the author's name, the engagement implies a partnership, and major financial decisions should involve both people. The reaction of the fianc\u00e9 indicates that this was a significant oversight in communication and consideration.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily a jerk, their actions led to a major conflict. The question is whether that makes them the asshole. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's lack of communication and consideration for her concerns probably contributed to the situation. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision, leading to a breakdown in their relationship.\n"
