Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after years of unemployment. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, especially since they could use the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, and they own the house outright.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author owns the house, so legally, they can do what they want. But the relationship aspect is crucial. The fianc\u00e9e is part of their life, and big financial decisions should ideally be discussed, especially when planning to get married. The project is causing them to live apart and considering breaking up. \n\nThe author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e before spending the bonus. Even though the bonus is their income, in a committed relationship, major expenses that affect shared living spaces (like tearing down walls) should be mutual decisions. The fianc\u00e9e feels disrespected and not involved in the decision-making process. \n\nWhile the author's intentions were to do something fun, the execution overlooked the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and the practical implications. The fact that the project is making the house uninhabitable and causing such tension shows a lack of consideration for the relationship's stability. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't legally wrong, the relational responsibility is there. They should have discussed the plan with their fianc\u00e9e first. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
