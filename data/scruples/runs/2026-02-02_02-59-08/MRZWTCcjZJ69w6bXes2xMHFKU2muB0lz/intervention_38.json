Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room, which has caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus from a job after being unemployed for years. They used the bonus to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, as the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's so angry she moved in with her sister and might break off the engagement.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. They also claim it's their house, so they have the right to do what they want. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels this was a major decision without discussion, especially in the context of their upcoming marriage.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issues here are communication and financial responsibility. Even though the author owns the house, significant home renovations can affect the property's structure and value, which might have implications for the future, especially since they are planning to get married. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels excluded from the decision-making process is a big red flag. In a committed relationship, especially one moving towards marriage, major financial decisions should be discussed together. The author made a unilateral decision that's impacting their partner's living situation and their shared future plans. \n\nThe author's argument that it's their house and the bonus is found money might have some merit in terms of ownership and personal choice, but relationships require compromise and mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, the wedding, and the stress are valid. By not considering her perspective and instead going ahead with the project, the author may have been dismissive of her feelings and the partnership aspect. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds another layer. Even if the author has legal authority, the emotional and practical impact on their partner is significant. The reaction from the fianc\u00e9 indicates that the author didn't take her feelings into account, which is a key part of a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely at fault for wanting to enjoy the bonus, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns likely places them in the wrong. The decision to proceed without discussion, especially on such a major project, shows a failure to respect the partner's viewpoint and the collaborative nature of their relationship as they approach marriage.\n"
