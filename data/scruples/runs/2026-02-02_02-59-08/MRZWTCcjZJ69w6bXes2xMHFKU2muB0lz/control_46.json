Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got a big bonus after being out of work for a while, and they used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and wants to use the money for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and that it's their house, so they have the right to do what they want.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they can renovate it. However, since they're engaged, there's a shared future involved. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, which is a red flag in relationships. Financial decisions, especially big ones, usually require mutual agreement when you're planning to marry. Even if the bonus is considered a personal windfall, using it for a major renovation without consulting the partner can cause conflict. The author's insistence on proceeding despite the fianc\u00e9's objections and the resulting move out by the fianc\u00e9 suggest that communication and partnership were issues here. While the author has the legal right to use their bonus, the relationship aspect is about respect and shared decision-making. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and financial priorities, leading to significant strain on the relationship. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and the decision impacted their partner negatively.\n"
