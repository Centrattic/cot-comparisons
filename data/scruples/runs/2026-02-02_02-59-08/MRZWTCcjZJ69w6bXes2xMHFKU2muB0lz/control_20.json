Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA problem. So the user got a bonus from a new job and used it to create a secret room in their house. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the user owns the house outright, given to them by their grandma. So legally, they have the right to make changes. The bonus was unexpected and might not recur. The user's reasoning is that it's \"found money\" to enjoy while they can.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9 is furious. They argue that the money could have been used for more practical purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. Also, the construction is making the house uninhabitable. The user's response is that it's their house, but since they're getting married, maybe they should have discussed it.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and the impact on the relationship. Even though the user has legal authority over the house, major renovations that affect living conditions should probably be discussed with a partner, especially since they're engaged. Using a significant bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective might be seen as selfish, even if it's their money. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding expenses are valid, as those are shared financial responsibilities in a marriage. The fact that the project is causing such strain suggests the user didn't consider the emotional and relational impact. So, while the user isn't legally wrong, they might be at fault for not communicating properly and prioritizing their own desire over the partner's needs and the relationship's stability. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
