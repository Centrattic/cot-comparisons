Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 spending a bonus on creating a secret room in their shared house, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, which involves significant construction. The house was inherited from the author's grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, arguing the money could have been used for debts, the wedding, or savings. The construction made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading her to move out and consider ending the engagement.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the factors. The bonus is described as \"found money,\" which the author sees as a one-time opportunity. However, even if it's a bonus, it's still earned money, and the fianc\u00e9 has a right to be involved in major financial decisions. Using a significant amount of money for a personal project without discussing it with a partner, especially when planning to get married, can be seen as irresponsible. Marriages require financial transparency and mutual agreement, especially when major expenses affect shared property.\n\nThe construction work has rendered the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which is a big deal. Even though the author owns the house, altering the structure in a way that affects their partner's living conditions is a problem. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding expenses might be valid, and the author didn't consider her perspective. The fact that this is a pre-marriage situation means that there's an expectation of shared financial planning. The author's actions could be seen as self-indulgent and dismissive of the partner's needs and the future of their marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it's their money and their house, and they wanted to use the bonus for a long-held dream. However, the context of being in a committed relationship with plans to marry changes the dynamics. The author didn't communicate or compromise, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, while perhaps extreme, is a response to feeling disrespected and excluded from major financial decisions.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author likely is in the wrong because they didn't negotiate with their fianc\u00e9 about a significant expense that affects their shared home and future. Even though they have legal ownership, relationships require mutual respect and discussion of such impactful decisions.\n"
