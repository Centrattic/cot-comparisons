Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author got a bonus from a new job, which they consider \"found money\" since they were out of work for years. They used it for a personal project, a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The house belongs to them, as it was given by their grandma, so they have legal authority to make changes. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible and they should have discussed it. The argument became so intense that she moved out and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they used their own money (bonus) on a project they've always wanted. They own the house, so legally it's their right. They might not get such a bonus again, so they wanted to enjoy it. \n\nFianc\u00e9's perspective: they are in a committed relationship, and major financial decisions should be discussed. Using a significant bonus without consultation might affect shared goals like paying off debt, wedding costs, or future savings. The changes to the house are making it hard for her to live there, which is a big deal. The fact that she moved out and the relationship is in jeopardy suggests that the author's actions were a big deal to her.\n\nEven though the author owns the house and the bonus is their own money, in a serious relationship like an engagement, financial decisions that impact both people should be made together. The author didn't discuss the use of the bonus, which was a five-figure amount. That's a substantial sum, and the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible. Also, the structural changes to the house (torn down walls, foundation work) are making the living situation difficult for her. \n\nSo even though the author has the legal right to make changes, the social and emotional context of the engagement is important. When you're engaged, you start making joint decisions, especially about shared living spaces and significant expenses. The author didn't consider their fianc\u00e9's feelings or financial priorities, leading to conflict. \n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication. The author made a big decision without consulting their fianc\u00e9, which could be seen as dismissive of her input and the partnership they're supposed to be building. The fact that she's now considering ending the engagement is a strong reaction, but it's rooted in her feeling that her partner isn't respecting joint responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, while the author isn't necessarily legally wrong, in the context of the relationship, they might be in the wrong because they didn't include their fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process, especially for a significant expense that affects their shared home. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions contributed to that by not discussing the plan beforehand.\n"
