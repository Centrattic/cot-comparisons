Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author got a bonus after a new job and decided to use it to create a secret room in their house. The house was inherited from their grandma, so they own it outright. The issue is with their fianc\u00e9 being upset about the decision. The fianc\u00e9 argues that the bonus could have been used to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author counters that the bonus was essentially found money and they should enjoy it now. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she's moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has legal ownership of the house and the bonus is their income, so technically they have the right to spend it as they wish. However, the fianc\u00e9 is a significant other, and the project is affecting their shared living space. The argument is about financial responsibility and communication.\n\nThe author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making the decision, which is a big deal. Even though it's their money and house, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions and home modifications can impact both partners. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs might be valid, especially if they had prior discussions about financial planning. The author might have overlooked the importance of mutual agreement on how to allocate the bonus.\n\nAlso, the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading her to move out. That's a significant consequence. While the author has legal rights, relationships require consideration and communication. The fact that the author is using a throwaway and the situation is causing such a rift suggests that there's a lack of communication or differing values.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might feel entitled to spend their bonus as they see fit, especially if it's a personal dream. But in a relationship, especially when planning a wedding, financial decisions often require compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction indicates that this decision went against their shared expectations or at least her expectations.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not discussing the bonus usage with the fianc\u00e9 and proceeding with a project that affects both of them. Even though the author has legal rights, the emotional and relational impact might place the responsibility on them to have communicated better. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared implications of the decision.\n"
