Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 spending a bonus on a secret room project, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, started tearing down walls and digging into the house. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinks it's irresponsible, and is considering calling off the wedding. The author argues it's their house, they own it, and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nHmm. The key points here are ownership of the house and shared financial decisions in a relationship. The house is owned by the author, so legally, they can make changes. But in a committed relationship, especially when planning a wedding, financial decisions might require mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e feels that major expenses without discussion are a problem. Even though the bonus is the author's, large projects that affect the shared living space and financial stability could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author might be seen as not considering the fianc\u00e9e's perspective. Even if they have the legal right, relationships require communication and compromise. The fact that the project is causing her to move out and end the engagement suggests that the author didn't take her concerns seriously. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments about using the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings are valid financial planning points. The author's response that it's \"found money\" might not address the fianc\u00e9e's need for financial security and joint decision-making.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right, in a relationship context, not discussing such a significant expense with their partner is a mistake. The level of conflict and the impact on their engagement suggests that the author didn't handle the situation well. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
