Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author took their bonus money to build a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that the money could have been used for debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's house was inherited, so they own it outright. Legally, they have the right to modify the house as they see fit. The bonus is a one-time, unexpected windfall, which the author considers as \"found money.\" However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that because they're getting married, major financial decisions should involve both parties. The conflict arises from the lack of communication and collaboration on such a big project, especially when it affects their shared living space and financial planning for the wedding.\n\nEven though the author owns the house, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The decision to undertake a significant renovation without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9, especially when using money that could be pooled for joint goals like the wedding or debt, is a red flag. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that the future spouse's input matters, especially when such large-scale changes impact the entire household. The fact that she's considering ending the engagement shows how serious she finds the issue. The author's stance that it's their house and the money is \"found\" may be true, but in a committed, long-term partnership, financial decisions that affect both partners' futures should be made together. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns and financial planning, leading to the conclusion that they are in the wrong.\n"
