Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a moderator, hence the throwaway account. They got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while, which is a big chunk of money. They wanted to create a secret room with a bookshelf door and a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is really upset, thinking the author used the bonus irresponsibly. She mentions that they could have used the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding costs, or save. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again and that it's their house, leading to intense arguments and the fianc\u00e9 moving in with her sister, possibly ending the 2-year relationship.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ownership of the house. The author says it's their house, given by their grandma. So legally, they own it and can make changes. But the fianc\u00e9 is involved in the relationship. Even if the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9 is supposed to be a partner in the marriage. Major renovations, especially those that disrupt the living space and use a significant amount of money, should probably be discussed with the partner. The author didn't mention discussing this with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding. That's a key point. \n\nThe bonus was a one-time, five-figure amount. The author sees it as \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about financial responsibility. The author's reasoning is that it's a fun project, but the fianc\u00e9 feels the money could have served better purposes. The author used the bonus without consulting their fianc\u00e9, which might be seen as disrespectful, especially since they're about to get married. \n\nMarriage usually involves shared financial decisions. Even if the house is the author's, the scale of the renovation (tearing down walls, digging into the foundation) would affect the entire house. If the fianc\u00e9 can't live in the house during the construction, that's a significant disruption. The author might have thought it's their house, but the financial and living impact on the fianc\u00e9 is real. \n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and financial implications on their partner without prior discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, and the author's decision to proceed without considering her input might be the problem. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they made a major financial and structural decision unilaterally, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. The key issue is communication and shared decision-making in a committed partnership.\n"
