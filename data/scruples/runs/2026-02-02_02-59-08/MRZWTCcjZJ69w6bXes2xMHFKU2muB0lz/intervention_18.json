Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for years. They used that money to build a secret room, which involves major construction. They own the house outright, so they have legal rights to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because the money could have been used for other priorities like paying debts, the wedding, or saving. She's so upset she moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" and they had the right to spend it. But the key issue here is the communication with their partner. Even though it's their house, relationships involve shared financial decisions, especially when major life events like a wedding are coming up. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 about the use of the bonus, which caused significant stress and possibly financial strain. The construction also made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, adding to the problem.\n\nSo, while the author legally has the right to spend their bonus as they wish, in a committed relationship, big financial decisions should be discussed with the partner. Not doing so can lead to conflict, especially when those decisions impact shared goals like a wedding. The author's actions led to a major fallout, which suggests they didn't consider their partner's perspective and priorities. That makes them at least partially responsible for the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
