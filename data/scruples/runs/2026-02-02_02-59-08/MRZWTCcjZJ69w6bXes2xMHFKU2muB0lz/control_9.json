Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author got a big bonus after landing a good job. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own because it was left to them by their grandma. They hired a contractor, started digging into the foundation, and now their fianc\u00e9 is really upset. She's considering calling off the wedding because she thinks it was irresponsible to use the bonus for this project instead of using the money for more practical things like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and that they have the right to do what they want with their house. The fianc\u00e9 has moved out, and the relationship might end.\n\nFirst, the author's side: They own the house and the bonus was their income. They had the financial means to do this project. The bonus was unexpected and might not recur, so they wanted to enjoy it. They might see it as their right to use their money as they wish.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: Even though the house is in the author's name, they're getting married. She might feel that major financial decisions should be made together, especially since they're planning to marry. The project is causing them to live in an unstable environment (construction), which could affect their wedding plans and financial stability. She might be worried about future responsibilities and the debt from the project.\n\nNow, considering the key points:\n\n1. Ownership of the House: The author owns the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, relationships involve shared responsibilities, even if the house isn't jointly owned yet. The fianc\u00e9 is part of a long-term commitment, so her feelings and concerns might be valid.\n\n2. Use of Bonus Money: The bonus was a personal income, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning a wedding, it's expected to discuss major financial decisions. The author might not have considered that the fianc\u00e9 would need that money for the wedding or other shared goals.\n\n3. Impact on the Relationship: The project caused significant conflict, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out. The author might not have realized how important it was to her to discuss financial matters together. The construction is making their living situation difficult, which adds stress during wedding planning.\n\n4. Communication: The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making the decision. Even if they have the legal right to use the bonus, the lack of communication and consideration for her perspective could be seen as a mistake.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable to want to use a bonus for a personal project, in a relationship, especially when engagement is involved, financial decisions that significantly impact the other person should be made collaboratively. The author's actions may have overlooked the fianc\u00e9's financial priorities and the importance of teamwork in a relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering breaking off the wedding due to this issue shows how severe the impact is.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally in the wrong (they own the house and the money), socially and in the context of a relationship, not discussing major financial decisions with their fianc\u00e9, especially one that affects their shared living situation and wedding plans, could be seen as a mistake. The contractor work causing them to not live in the house adds to the disruption.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly, and their actions have caused significant distress to their fianc\u00e9, affecting their relationship and future plans. Even though they had the right to spend the money, the way it was done without considering the other person's perspective is the issue.\n"
