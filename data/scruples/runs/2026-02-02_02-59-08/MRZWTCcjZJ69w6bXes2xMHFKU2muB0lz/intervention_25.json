Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author got a bonus and decided to build a secret room in their house. They own the house outright, so legally they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thought they should have used the money for other priorities like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and they should enjoy it now.\n\nHmm, the key here is the relationship aspect. Even though the author has the right to use their bonus as they see fit, the fact that this decision has caused a major conflict leading to the fianc\u00e9e moving out and considering ending the relationship is a big issue. They were supposed to be planning their future together, and a major project like this without discussing it properly might not consider the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and expectations. The author might have assumed it was a personal choice, but since they're engaged, major financial decisions probably should involve both parties. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that it's irresponsible and disregards their shared goals. The author's actions led to a breakdown in communication and trust, which is why the fianc\u00e9e is so upset. So, even if the author isn't legally wrong, they might be at fault for not considering their partner's input and the impact on their relationship.\n"
