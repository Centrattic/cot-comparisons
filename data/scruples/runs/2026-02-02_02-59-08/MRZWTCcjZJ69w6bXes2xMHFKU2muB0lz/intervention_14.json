Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after a period of unemployment. They used this money to build a secret room, hiring a contractor. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and wants the money used for other purposes like paying off debt or saving for the wedding. The author argues it's \"found\" money and their house, so they have the right to do what they want. The result is that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved out and might end the engagement.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. Legally, the author owns the house and the bonus is their own money, so they can spend it as they wish. However, in a relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9, major decisions that affect shared life and future plans should involve mutual discussion. The secret room project is altering the house structure significantly, which could affect the value or use of the property, potentially impacting both partners. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows the severity of the issue.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their house and the bonus is a one-time event. But in a committed relationship, financial decisions, especially large ones, usually require compromise. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. Even if the author had the right to spend the money, doing so without considering their partner's perspective is a relational mistake.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally in the wrong, the social and relational aspects suggest they are. The answer would be AITA A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and future plans.\n"
