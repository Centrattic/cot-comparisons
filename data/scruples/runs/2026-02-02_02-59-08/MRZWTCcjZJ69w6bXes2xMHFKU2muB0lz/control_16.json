Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who took a bonus from his job to create a secret room in his house using a bookshelf door. His fianc\u00e9e is upset and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright since it was given by his grandma. So legally, he has the right to modify it. But the main issue is the relationship conflict. The bonus was a one-time thing, and he saw it as \"found money.\" His fianc\u00e9e disagrees, thinking they should use the money for more practical purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. She's also unhappy with the construction making the house uninhabitable.\n\nNow, even though legally he can do whatever he wants with his property, relationships require mutual discussion and agreement. The problem is that he made a big decision without consulting her, leading to serious consequences. The fact that she's considering ending their engagement shows how much this has hurt her feelings. Even if the money was his bonus, big projects that affect shared living spaces should be discussed with a partner. The construction disrupting their daily life adds to the problem.\n\nSo while he's not legally wrong, in a relationship, major financial decisions and home modifications that affect both partners should be discussed. His actions might have been self-indulgent without considering her needs and the partnership aspect. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not involving her in the decision-making process.\n"
