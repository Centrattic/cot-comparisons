Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 spending a bonus on a secret room project without consulting their partner, leading to a major conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author got a five-figure bonus from a job they just landed. They wanted a secret room in their house, so they hired a contractor, started construction, and now the fianc\u00e9 is furious. The fianc\u00e9 wants the bonus money to be used for debts, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was \"found money.\"\n\nNow, considering the relationship aspect. The couple is engaged, which implies they've made significant commitments to each other. Even though the house is owned by the author, it's their shared home. Making major changes without discussing them with a partner, especially when the funds are part of their combined financial future, can be seen as a breach of trust and communication. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and shared goals are valid. The author's decision to proceed without discussion might have overlooked the partner's expectations and the collaborative nature of a marriage. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering calling off the wedding shows how serious the issue is. While the author might see the bonus as their own money, in a committed relationship, big financial decisions often require mutual agreement. So, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and dismissive of their partner's input, which is a key factor in determining if they're in the wrong.\n"
