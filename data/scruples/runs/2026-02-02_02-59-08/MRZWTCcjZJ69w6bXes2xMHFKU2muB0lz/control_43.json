Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while and received a five-figure bonus. They used that bonus to hire a contractor to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks the bonus should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. She's so upset she moved out and is considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author used their own bonus money for a personal project. The house is their property, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9e is involved in the situation, and the project is causing them to live apart, which is causing significant relationship strain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is spending their own money on their own property. They might argue that the bonus is a windfall and they have the right to spend it as they wish. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is involved in the relationship, and major financial decisions might require discussion, even if it's their own money. The fact that the project is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9e adds another layer of complexity. Even though the author owns the house, making modifications that affect the fianc\u00e9e's ability to live there could be problematic, especially in a committed relationship nearing marriage.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions often require communication and mutual agreement. The author might have acted unilaterally without considering the fianc\u00e9e's perspective, leading to conflict. While the author is legally allowed to spend their bonus as they like, the social expectation in a committed relationship might be to discuss major expenditures that impact both partners. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is considering ending the engagement suggests that the author's actions have caused significant harm.\n\nSo, balancing legal rights against relationship responsibilities, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's concerns and the impact on their relationship. Even though it's their money and house, the decision had a major effect on the relationship, which could be seen as irresponsible from the fianc\u00e9e's viewpoint.\n"
