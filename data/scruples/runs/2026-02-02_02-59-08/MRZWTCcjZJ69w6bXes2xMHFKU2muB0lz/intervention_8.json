Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved major renovations. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thought the money should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was \"found money.\"\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and shared financial decisions. Even though the author owns the house, they're engaged, so big financial decisions might need mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input wasn't considered, which led to her moving out and considering ending the relationship. \n\nThe author might not be wrong in wanting to do something fun with their bonus, but the way they went about it without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 could be the issue. Using \"found money\" as a reason might not address the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning. Also, major renovations affecting the livability of the house could be a valid point for her frustration.\n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely wrong, the lack of communication and the impact on the relationship makes me think they are at least somewhat in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
