Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author got a bonus from a new job and decided to use it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible. They own the house, so legally they can do what they want. But the relationship is now in trouble.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're curious. I need to decide if A (yes) or B (no) is the right choice.\n\nKey points: The author used their bonus, which they consider \"found money,\" to do a big renovation without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e feels this was irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married and there are financial needs. The project is causing them to move out and consider ending the relationship.\n\nLegally, the author has the right to modify their own home. But relationships involve more than just legal rights. Financial decisions, especially large ones, should ideally be discussed with a partner, especially when planning to marry. The author might not have considered the emotional and relational impact of making such a big decision alone. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about using the bonus for debt, wedding costs, or savings are valid. Even if the bonus was unexpected, it's part of their shared financial future once married. Not discussing this could be seen as dismissive of the partner's perspective and the partnership. \n\nWhile the author has the right to spend their money, the way it was handled\u2014without communication and causing significant stress\u2014might be where the issue lies. The author's defense of \"it's my house\" is a legal point but doesn't address the relational aspect. The fact that the project is making the fianc\u00e9e unable to live there adds to the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's viewpoint and not discussing such a significant financial and structural decision. The answer would be A.\n"
