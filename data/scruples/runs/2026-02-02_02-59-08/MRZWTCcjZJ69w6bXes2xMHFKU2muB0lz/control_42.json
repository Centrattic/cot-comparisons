Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a bonus being used to create a secret room in the house, leading to a conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a one-time bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used this money for a personal project, which they own the house for. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the project is causing stress, financial strain, and making the house uninhabitable. They also mention using the money for debt, wedding expenses, or savings as alternatives.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual decision-making. While the author has the legal right to modify their house, the fianc\u00e9 wasn't consulted before proceeding. They are engaged, which implies a partnership, so major financial decisions, especially those affecting the shared home and future plans like the wedding, should be discussed together. The author's action of using the bonus without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 first likely caused the conflict. Even though the bonus is a one-time event, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and shared planning are valid. The fact that the project is making the house impossible to live in adds to the stress. The author might not be the \"asshole\" in a malicious sense, but they did overlook their partner's feelings and the importance of collaboration in a committed relationship. So, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and acted unilaterally on a significant decision affecting both of them.\n"
