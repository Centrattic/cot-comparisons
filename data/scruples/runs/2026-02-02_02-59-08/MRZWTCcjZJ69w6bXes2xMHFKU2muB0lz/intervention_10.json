Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They wanted to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, so they hired a contractor. They own the house outright since it was inherited from their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to spend it as they like. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved out and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case. I need to decide if the answer is A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break this down. The author made a big decision without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9. Even though they own the house, a major renovation like digging up the foundation and tearing walls affects the entire home. If they're getting married, financial decisions should be joint. The bonus was a windfall, but using it for a personal project might not consider the other person's priorities. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that there was no discussion, which is a key point in relationships. The author's argument that it's their house might have legal grounds, but relationships require compromise and communication. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved out suggests this was a significant breach in their partnership. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they earned the bonus and wanted to use a windfall for a personal dream. However, in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions should involve both parties. The lack of communication and the impact on the house (which they'll both live in) is a big issue. The author didn't consider their partner's valid concerns about debt, wedding costs, and future savings. Even if the bonus is seen as extra money, the way it was spent without discussing it with the fianc\u00e9 is problematic. \n\nSo, the main issues here are communication and consideration of the partner's needs. The author might not be a \"bad person\" but their actions disregarded the fianc\u00e9's input and the shared financial goals of the relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate properly and made a major financial decision that affects both of them without considering their partner's perspective.\n"
