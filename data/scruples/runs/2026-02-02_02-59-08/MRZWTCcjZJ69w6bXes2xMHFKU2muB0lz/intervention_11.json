Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author used a bonus to create a \"secret\" room in their house, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author owns the house outright and has legal authority to modify it. However, they're engaged to someone who's now upset about the financial decision. The main issues are financial responsibility, communication, and the impact on their relationship.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as selfish if they didn't discuss the major expense with their fianc\u00e9. Even though the bonus is a one-time windfall, in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married, big financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels the need to move out and consider ending the engagement shows the seriousness of the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the bonus was unexpected and they wanted to enjoy it. But the problem here isn't just the spending\u2014it's the lack of communication and considering the partner's perspective. The construction also made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which adds practical stress.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, the social and relational aspects suggest that they should have discussed the decision with their fianc\u00e9. Not doing so could be seen as disregarding the partner's feelings and financial priorities, which is a common AITA scenario. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they acted unilaterally on a major financial decision affecting their partner.\n"
