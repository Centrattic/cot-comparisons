Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author took a bonus from their job and decided to use it for a personal project. They mention the bonus was a one-time, unexpected amount, which they consider \"found money.\" They own the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels this was irresponsible. She wanted the money used for shared expenses like debt, the wedding, or savings. The author didn't consult her beforehand, leading to a major argument and her moving out.\n\nThe key points here are communication and shared financial planning in a relationship. Even though the author legally has the right to use their bonus as they wish, relationships often require discussing major financial decisions, especially when planning to get married. The author's decision to proceed without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 shows a lack of consideration for their partner's perspective and the shared future they're building. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about responsibility and shared financial planning are valid, especially when planning a wedding. The author's actions have caused significant stress and possibly the end of the relationship, which suggests that their approach was flawed, even if their actions were legally permissible. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate properly and failed to consider their partner's valid concerns in a committed relationship.\n"
