Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room, which caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author did own the house outright since it was given by their grandmother. So legally, they had the right to make renovations. However, the key issue here is the relationship aspect. The author's fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for other priorities like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The author sees the bonus as a one-time opportunity to fulfill a personal dream, while the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and unconsulted.\n\nEven though the house is the author's, the relationship context matters. Decisions that affect shared financial responsibilities, especially when planning to get married, should ideally involve both partners. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which led to significant conflict. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering breaking off the wedding suggests that this was a major breach of trust or communication.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bonus was \"found money,\" but in a committed relationship, especially pre-marriage, financial decisions should be made collaboratively. The unilateral decision to use the bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective can be seen as selfish, even if legally they have the right to spend their own money. The emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9 is significant, leading to her moving out and the relationship being in jeopardy. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, in terms of relationship responsibilities and communication, they might be at fault for not discussing the use of the bonus and not considering their partner's concerns. The fianc\u00e9's anger is justified given the potential impact on their shared future plans. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not involving their partner in the financial decision-making process.\n"
