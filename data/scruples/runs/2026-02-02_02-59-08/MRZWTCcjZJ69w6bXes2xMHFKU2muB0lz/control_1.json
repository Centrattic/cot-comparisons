Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9e's reaction to the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author got a job, received a bonus, and used it to build a secret room with a contractor. The house is owned outright, so there's no mortgage issue. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering calling off the wedding. The author argues that the bonus was found money and that it's their house.\n\nNow, I need to consider different angles. Legally, the author has the right to modify the house as they own it. Financially, using a one-time bonus for a personal project isn't inherently wrong, but it's a lifestyle choice that affects a partner. The conflict here isn't about legality but about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's concerns are about potential debt, wedding costs, and the immediate disruption of tearing down walls. The author didn't consult them before spending the bonus, which seems to be a major issue. Even if it's their house, a significant project like this would likely impact the partner's living situation. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e feels her input was ignored, especially in a relationship where they plan to get married, points to a lack of communication. \n\nIn relationships, shared financial decisions are important. Using a bonus for a personal project without discussing it with a partner, especially when the project causes significant disruption, could be seen as selfish. The author's insistence that it's \"their house\" and the dismissive attitude towards the fianc\u00e9e's concerns might be where they're in the wrong. The bonus is a personal windfall, but relationships require mutual agreement on major expenses, especially when they affect the shared living space and future plans.\n\nSo, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the judgment here is about the relationship dynamic. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's perspective and the impact on their relationship, leading to a major conflict over a shared future.\n"
