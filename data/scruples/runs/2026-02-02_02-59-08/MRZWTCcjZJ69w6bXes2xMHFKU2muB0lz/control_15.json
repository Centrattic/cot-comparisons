Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. They own the house outright, so legally they can do what they want. But the relationship is suffering because of this.\n\nFirst, the bonus was a one-time thing, which the author sees as \"found money.\" They wanted to use it for something they wanted, a secret room. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks they should have used the money for more practical purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She also can't live in the house during the construction, which is causing her to move in with her sister. The author's argument is that it's their house and they can do what they want with their bonus. \n\nBut here's the thing: even though the house is the author's, they are engaged. That means they are in a committed relationship where financial decisions might need mutual discussion, especially if it affects the other person's life. The fianc\u00e9 is part of their future, so big decisions that impact shared living spaces or financial stability could require her input. The author didn't consult her before starting the project, which led to her feeling disrespected. \n\nEven though the author has the legal right to modify the house, relationships require communication and consideration. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she's considering breaking off the engagement suggests that the author didn't take her feelings into account. The construction is making it impossible for her to live there, which is a significant inconvenience. \n\nSo, while using a bonus for a personal project isn't inherently wrong, not discussing it with the fianc\u00e9 and causing such a major conflict might be where the author went wrong. The key issue is the lack of communication and mutual decision-making in a committed relationship. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the impact on their relationship.\n"
