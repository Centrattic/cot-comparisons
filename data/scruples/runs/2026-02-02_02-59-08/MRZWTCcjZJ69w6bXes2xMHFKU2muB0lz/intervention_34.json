Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author got a big bonus after returning to work. They wanted to build a secret room, which they funded entirely from the bonus. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal rights to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't consult them, and the project has caused significant disruption. The fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and shared financial responsibility. Even though the author used their own bonus money, the project affects the entire home, which presumably the couple was planning to live in together. By not discussing the plans with the fianc\u00e9 beforehand, the author may have overlooked the partner's feelings and financial priorities. The fianc\u00e9 feels that their input was disregarded, leading to the breakdown in their relationship.\n\nWhile the author has the legal right to modify the house, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The author's actions, though understandable as a personal dream, may have been selfish in not involving their partner in the decision. The fact that the project caused the fianc\u00e9 to move out and consider ending the engagement suggests that the author's actions were a significant mistake in terms of relationship management.\n\nSo, considering both the financial and emotional aspects, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and consider their partner's perspective, leading to serious consequences for their relationship.\n"
