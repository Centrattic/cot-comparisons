Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after years of unemployment, which they consider \"found money.\" They own the house outright because their grandma gave it to them, so legally, they have the right to make changes. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't discuss this with them. The fianc\u00e9 feels the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. The project has become so disruptive that the fianc\u00e9 can't live in the house anymore and is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to weigh both sides. Legally, the author has the right to their bonus and the house. The bonus is their personal income, so using it as they see fit isn't illegal. But in a relationship, especially one where they're planning to get married, there's an expectation of shared financial decisions. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which might be the key issue here. The bonus was used for a personal project that's causing significant disruption to the relationship and their living situation. Even though the author owns the house, making such a large structural change without discussing it might be seen as not considering the partner's feelings or the future of their marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the bonus was unexpected and the author wanted to treat themselves after a period of unemployment. The idea of a secret room is a personal dream, and since the house is theirs, they might feel it's their right to make such a change. But the problem isn't just the use of the money\u2014it's the fact that the project was done without the fianc\u00e9's input, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about practical uses for the bonus and the current living situation are valid. Even if the author has the legal right, emotionally and socially, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions affecting the shared home should involve mutual agreement.\n\nSo, the main points are: legal ownership vs. relationship responsibilities, the nature of the bonus as a one-time windfall, and the lack of communication. While the author isn't necessarily at fault legally, the relationship aspect suggests that not discussing such a significant project and its financial implications with a fianc\u00e9 is a mistake. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme (moving out, considering calling off the wedding), but their concerns might be rooted in feeling disrespected as a partner. The author should have at least talked to their fianc\u00e9 about the plans, even if the bonus was their money. The disruption to the house and the partner's life is another factor\u2014structural changes can be invasive and affect the home they're supposed to share.\n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because despite legal rights, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's perspective in such a major decision is a relationship issue. The fianc\u00e9's feelings about the financial priorities and the living situation are important and should be addressed through discussion rather than unilateral action.\n"
