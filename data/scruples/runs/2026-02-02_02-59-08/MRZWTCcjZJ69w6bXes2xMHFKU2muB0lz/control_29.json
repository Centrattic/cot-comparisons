Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus from a new job after being out of work for a while. They used that bonus to build a secret room in the house, which they own outright since it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think using the bonus was irresponsible and could have been used for other things like paying off debt, funding the wedding, or saving. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to enjoy it, plus they own the house so it's their decision.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are the financial responsibility, the engagement context, and the impact on their relationship. \n\nThe author has the legal right to modify their house since they own it. So from a legal standpoint, they're not wrong. But financially, the question is whether using the bonus was irresponsible. The bonus isn't part of their regular income, so maybe the author sees it as discretionary. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that as a couple preparing to get married, major financial decisions should be discussed. Even though they aren't married yet, financial compatibility is important in a relationship, especially when it comes to big expenses that affect shared living situations.\n\nThe fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this is a big deal. The author's actions led to such a conflict that she's moved in with her sister. The secret room is a personal project, but it's causing significant stress in the relationship. The author might have assumed they could make the decision independently, but in a serious relationship, especially an engagement, major financial decisions often require mutual agreement. \n\nAlso, the modification is extensive\u2014digging into the foundation and tearing walls. This affects the structure of the house and could have hidden costs or issues. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for more practical purposes (debt, wedding) might be valid, especially if they have financial goals as a couple. The author's argument that it's \"found money\" might not consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective on shared financial responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, even if the author has the right to do it legally, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's feelings and priorities is a problem. The author might not be the asshole legally, but in terms of relationship responsibility, they might have made a mistake by not discussing it beforehand. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their fianc\u00e9's feelings and the shared financial planning in a serious relationship, leading to a major conflict. Even though they have legal ownership, the relationship aspect is where the issue lies.\n"
