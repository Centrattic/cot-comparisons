Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a big bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which their fianc\u00e9 is upset about. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married and there are other financial priorities like paying off debt, the wedding, and saving. The author argues that the bonus is \"found money\" and they have the right to spend it as they like since they own the house.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's argument is that the bonus was a one-time thing and they have the legal right to modify their own house. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that major financial decisions should be made together, especially since they're close to marriage. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 has moved out and is considering ending the relationship suggests the conflict is serious.\n\nThe main issue here is financial decision-making in a committed relationship. Even though the author legally owns the house, significant projects that affect the entire house (like tearing down walls and digging into the foundation) might impact the fianc\u00e9's use of the home. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about shared financial responsibilities and planning for marriage are valid. In many relationships, couples discuss major expenses, even if one partner is the legal owner. The author's decision to proceed without consultation might have disregarded the fianc\u00e9's feelings and the partnership aspect.\n\nAlso, the bonus, while a windfall, was earned income. The argument that it's \"found money\" might not hold if the job was stable enough to provide such a bonus. The fianc\u00e9's points about using it for debt or the wedding are practical considerations for a future spouse. The author's unilateral decision to spend it on a personal project caused significant distress, leading to a potential breakup. That seems like a major consequence.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to use their money, the way they went about it\u2014without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9, especially given their impending marriage\u2014likely caused the problem. The key here is the lack of communication and considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve their partner in such a significant financial decision that affects their shared life.\n"
