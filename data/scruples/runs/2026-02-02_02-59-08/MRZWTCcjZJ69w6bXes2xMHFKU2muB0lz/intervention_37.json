Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They decided to use that bonus to create a secret room in their house, which involves tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. They own the house outright, so legally they can do whatever they want. But their fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinking it was irresponsible. She wanted the money used for paying debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they should enjoy it. Now the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because she can't live in the house anymore, and they've moved apart.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Legally, the author is in the right because they own the house. But relationships aren't just about legalities. The key issue here is communication and mutual decision-making. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 about such a major financial and structural decision. Even though it's their bonus money, using it for a personal project that affects their shared home (even if they own it) without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 is a big deal. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid because they are planning to get married, which implies shared financial planning. The author's project isn't just a small expense; it's a significant alteration to their home, which affects both of them. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now forced to move out because of the construction shows how disruptive this is. \n\nThe author might see the bonus as a one-time windfall, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning a marriage, major expenditures should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 feels that the money could have been used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding. The author's dismissal of her concerns and the unilateral decision-making are probably the root of the problem here. \n\nSo while the author isn't legally wrong, in a relationship context, they neglected to communicate and consider their partner's priorities. That's where the \"asshole\" factor comes in. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
