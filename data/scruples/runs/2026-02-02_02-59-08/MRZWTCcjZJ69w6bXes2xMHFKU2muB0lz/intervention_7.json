Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 using their bonus money to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9e who wants to call off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a few years. The bonus is five figures, which is a lot. They wanted to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, hired a contractor, started tearing walls and digging the foundation. The house is their grandma's, given to them, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9e is angry, saying it was irresponsible to use the bonus instead of paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She's now living with her sister and considering ending the relationship.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and shared life decisions in a relationship. The author argues the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to spend it on something fun. The fianc\u00e9e thinks it's irresponsible because they're about to get married, and such a big project could have financial implications. Also, the construction is making the house uninhabitable for her.\n\nEven though the author owns the house, when you're engaged and planning to get married, major financial decisions should be discussed with a partner. The bonus is a significant amount, and the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and savings are valid. The fact that the author went ahead without discussing it and now the fianc\u00e9e feels her input was ignored is a big issue. \n\nThe idea of a \"secret room\" is a personal desire, but in a committed relationship, especially one on the brink of marriage, both partners' priorities should be considered. The author's actions may have been impulsive and self-centered, not considering the fianc\u00e9e's perspective. The contractor work causing the house to be unusable is another problem because it affects their shared living space and the fianc\u00e9e's comfort.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, they might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate with their fianc\u00e9e about a major financial decision that impacts both of them. In a relationship, especially pre-marriage, financial transparency and mutual agreement are crucial. The author's defense of using \"found money\" might not hold weight if it's causing significant strain and disregards the partner's priorities. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is understandable given the potential long-term financial implications and the immediate disruption to their living situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's views and the impact on their relationship when making a large financial decision.\n"
