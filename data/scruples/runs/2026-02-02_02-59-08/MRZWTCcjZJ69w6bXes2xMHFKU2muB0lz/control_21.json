Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They used this money to build a secret room, which involves significant construction. The house was given to them by their grandma, paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. She wanted to use the money for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again and that it's their house.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about financial responsibility and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author did use their own money, which they legally have the right to do since they own the house. But the fianc\u00e9 is part of the relationship, and major financial decisions might need discussion, especially when planning to get married. The construction is also affecting their living situation, making it hard for her to stay in the house.\n\nThe author says it's their house, but when you're engaged, shared living spaces and financial planning become important. Even if the house is in their name, big projects that affect both partners' lives should probably be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input wasn't considered, which is a valid relationship concern. The author might not be legally wrong, but emotionally and relationally, they might have made a mistake by not involving their partner in the decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because they didn't communicate properly. If B (no), because they have the right to their money and the house. But since the fianc\u00e9 is affected and they're planning to get married, the answer might lean towards A. But I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that it's their money and house, but relationships require compromise. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is about financial planning and shared responsibilities. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not discussing it beforehand. So, answer A.\n"
