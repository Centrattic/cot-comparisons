Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus. They used it to build a secret room, which the contractor started working on by tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the bonus should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time opportunity to have fun with it.\n\nKey points to consider: The house was inherited and owned by the author, so legally, they have the right to modify it. However, they are engaged and living together, so financial decisions should ideally be mutual. The partner feels the project was impulsive and ignored shared financial goals. The project has made the house uninhabitable for the partner, leading to her moving out with her sister.\n\nThe author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time chance. But in a committed relationship, major expenditures\u2014especially ones that affect the shared living space\u2014should be discussed. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 before starting the project, leading to significant conflict. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how serious the breach of trust is.\n\nEven though the author legally owns the house, relationships require communication and compromise. Using a bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's concerns and the impact on their shared life might be seen as selfish. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about financial planning and the immediate disruption caused by the construction.\n\nSo, while the author's actions are legally permissible, the social and relational aspects are where they might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
