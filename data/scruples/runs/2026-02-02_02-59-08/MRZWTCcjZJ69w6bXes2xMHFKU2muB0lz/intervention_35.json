Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used this bonus to build a secret room with a contractor, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. She's so upset she's moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author owns the house outright, so they have legal rights to modify it. The bonus is described as \"found money\" that might not come again. The author's reasoning is that it's their money to spend as they see fit. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major financial decisions should be discussed, especially since they're engaged and planning to merge their lives.\n\nFactors to consider: communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a significant financial commitment. Even though it's their money, in a relationship, especially one where they're planning to marry, major expenses can affect both partners. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made unilaterally, which can be a point of contention. The construction is also causing them to be unable to live in the house, adding to the stress.\n\nThe author's stance is that the bonus was a one-time thing and they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are about financial responsibility and shared planning. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but in a relationship, mutual respect and communication are important. Disregarding the partner's financial priorities without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the action is legally permissible.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether the author should have discussed the use of the bonus with their fianc\u00e9 first. Since they didn't, and the decision caused a major rift, it's possible the author is in the wrong in terms of relationship dynamics, even if they have legal right. Relationships often require compromise and shared decision-making, especially regarding finances when planning a future together.\n"
