Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person using a bonus to create a secret room, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus, which they consider \"found money.\" They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. They own the house outright, so legally, they can make changes. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they might have needed the money for other things like debt, the wedding, or saving. She's also upset about the construction affecting their living situation. They're now separated, and the engagement might be over.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before spending the bonus. Even though the house is theirs, big projects that affect shared living space should probably be discussed with a partner, especially when there's a wedding and shared financial goals. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is worried about debt and the wedding costs suggests that they had different priorities. The author saw the bonus as a one-time opportunity, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible not to consider their joint future. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but relationally, not discussing such a major expense could be seen as selfish or dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns. So, even though the author has the right to spend their bonus, the lack of communication and considering the partner's perspective might make them the asshole. So the answer is A.\n"
