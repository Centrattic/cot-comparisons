Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a major conflict with his partner. \n\nFirst, the author received a bonus after being out of work for a few years. He used it to start a significant home project, which his fianc\u00e9 is upset about. She's angry because she thinks the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. She's even moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author owns the house outright because it was given to him by his grandma. He had the legal right to modify it. However, the project is causing significant stress in the relationship. The partner feels that the decision was made without discussion, which is a big issue in a relationship. \n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. While he legally has the right to modify the house and the bonus was a windfall, relationships require communication and mutual respect. Even if the money is his, big financial decisions that impact the relationship and shared future (like wedding costs) should be discussed. The partner's concerns about using the money for debt or the wedding are valid, and the author didn't consult her before proceeding. \n\nThe project is already causing the house to be unlivable, which is a huge inconvenience. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship shows how serious the issue is. So, while the author might not be legally wrong, in a relationship context, not discussing such a major expense that affects both of them is a mistake. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider his partner's perspective and the impact on their relationship.\n"
