Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author received a five-figure bonus from their new job after being out of work for years. They decided to use this bonus to build a secret room with a bookshelf door and a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was inherited from their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time opportunity.\n\nNow, I should evaluate both sides. The author has the legal right to modify their property, and the bonus wasn't part of their regular income. They did use their own money, so there's no financial obligation to the fianc\u00e9. However, the project is causing significant stress and upheaval in their living situation, leading the fianc\u00e9 to move out and consider ending the engagement. The author might be overlooking the emotional impact and the shared future they're planning by not discussing major financial decisions with their partner.\n\nFinancial responsibility is subjective. The author sees the bonus as a windfall to enjoy, while the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a resource that should be managed for future needs. In a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, major financial decisions often require mutual agreement. Ignoring the partner's concerns, especially when it leads to such a drastic outcome as breaking up, suggests a lack of communication and consideration for the partner's perspective.\n\nHowever, the author isn't legally obligated to consult their fianc\u00e9, but ethically, partnerships often involve shared decision-making. The key here is the effect on their relationship. The author's actions have caused significant distress, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out. That's a severe consequence. Even if the author has the legal right, the emotional toll and lack of discussion could be seen as the problem.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for spending their own money on their property, the way they handled the situation\u2014without considering their partner's feelings and the implications on their relationship\u2014might place them in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's unilateral decision contributed to the conflict. Balancing both perspectives, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the relationship impact despite legal ownership.\n"
