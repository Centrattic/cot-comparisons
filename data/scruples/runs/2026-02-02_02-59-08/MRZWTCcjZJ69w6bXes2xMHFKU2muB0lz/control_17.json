Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user got a bonus from a good year at work, which they considered \"found money.\" They used it to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's so mad she moved out and might end the wedding.\n\nFirst, the user owns the house, so legally, they can do what they want. But relationships involve more than legal rights. The user didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a problem. Even if the money is theirs, major home renovations, especially ones that disrupt the structure and make the house uninhabitable, should be discussed with a partner they're about to marry. The contractor work is already causing issues, and the fianc\u00e9e feels her needs (wedding costs, debt) are being overlooked. The user's stance is that it's their bonus to spend, but relationships require compromise. The key here is communication and mutual respect for each other's priorities. The user might not be in legal wrong, but emotionally and relationally, they failed to consider their fianc\u00e9e's perspective, leading to a major conflict. So, the answer is A.\n"
