Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author got a bonus from a new job and used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks spending the bonus was irresponsible, especially since they're planning a wedding and have debts. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they can do what they want. Now, their relationship is in trouble, and she's moved out, considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility, communication, and respect in a relationship. The author owns the house, so legally, they can renovate it. But the issue isn't just about legal rights; it's about the relationship dynamics. The fianc\u00e9 is part of the shared life, and major financial decisions, especially those affecting the home they live in, should probably be discussed. Even if the author owns the house, the renovations are making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, which adds stress. \n\nThe bonus was a one-time thing, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it should have been used for more pressing matters like debt or the wedding. The author's argument is that it's their money to spend as they like, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, big financial decisions might need mutual agreement. The fact that the author didn't consult her and went ahead with the project could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and priorities. Even if the author isn't obligated legally, emotionally, it's a different story. The fianc\u00e9's anger and the potential breakup suggest that the author's actions hurt the relationship, which is a significant consequence. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, in the context of their relationship, not communicating and making a unilateral decision that affects both of them might make them the asshole. Relationships require compromise and consideration, even when it comes to personal desires. The author's insistence on doing it their way without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
