Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted to build a secret room, which they had always wanted. The house was their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. They hired a contractor, started tearing walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinking it's irresponsible, and they might break off the wedding. She mentions using the money for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" they might not get again, and it's their house.\n\nSo, the main points are: legality vs. financial responsibility and relationship dynamics. Legally, the author has the right to modify their own property. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. The author didn't discuss this with her before starting the project, which might be a bigger issue. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations that affect the living situation of the fianc\u00e9 (who lives there) should probably be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 can't live in the house now because of the construction adds to the problem. Also, using a bonus that was meant to be shared in a committed relationship without prior agreement could be seen as selfish. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" might be valid, but relationships require compromise. Not considering the partner's perspective and the shared financial responsibilities (like the wedding and debt) could make the author at fault. So, even though legally they're okay, in terms of relationship responsibility, they might be in the wrong.\n"
