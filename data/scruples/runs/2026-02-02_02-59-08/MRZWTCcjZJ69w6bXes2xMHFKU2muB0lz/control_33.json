Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the setup is that the author got a bonus from a new job and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about it, leading to potential breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns the house outright since it was inherited from their grandma. They used their bonus, which they consider \"found money,\" to fund this project. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they were supposed to be discussing finances, and this project is causing them to live apart, with her considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nSo, legal ownership is on the author's side. They have the right to modify their own property. But relationships involve more than just legal rights. The main issue here is financial responsibility and communication. The author spent a significant amount of money from their bonus without the fianc\u00e9e's input. Even though it's their bonus, in a committed relationship, especially when planning a wedding, big financial decisions should be discussed. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because they could have used the money for other priorities like paying off debt or wedding expenses, which could ease her family's financial burden. The author's argument is that the bonus is a one-time thing and they wanted to use it for a personal dream. However, not considering their partner's perspective and the impact on their shared future (like the wedding plans and living situation) could be seen as selfish.\n\nEven though the author has the legal right to make changes to the house, the emotional impact and lack of communication are significant. The fact that the project is so disruptive (torn walls, foundation work) is making it hard for the fianc\u00e9e to live there, which adds to the tension. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author may have acted on their own desires without considering the partner's needs and the shared financial goals. So while legally they may not be wrong, in terms of relationship dynamics, they might be at fault for not discussing the decision and considering the consequences on their partner and the marriage plans.\n"
