Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a big argument with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for years. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they thought the money should have been used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The fianc\u00e9 even moved out, considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering relationships, finances are a big part. Even if the author has the legal right to use the house, the financial decision affected their partner. The bonus might be seen as \"found money,\" but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions usually require discussion. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which caused a breakdown in communication. The project also made the house uninhabitable for the partner, adding to the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, in a relationship context, not discussing such a significant expense that impacts shared life is a misstep. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and shared goals are valid. The author's actions disregarded the partner's priorities, leading to serious consequences. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and the relationship's shared financial planning.\n"
