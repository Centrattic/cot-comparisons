Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author received a bonus after being unemployed for a while, and they decided to use that money for a personal project. The house is owned by them outright, so they have legal control. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money could have been used for more practical things like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, and it's their house to do with as they please.\n\nNow, considering the relationship aspect. They're engaged, so there's an expectation of shared financial planning. Even though the house is the author's, big projects like this can affect the entire relationship. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which is a major point. In any relationship, even if you have the legal right to do something, how it affects the partner matters. The fianc\u00e9 feels disrespected and unheard, leading to her moving out and considering ending the engagement. \n\nThe author's actions led to significant stress and possible breakdown of the relationship. While the bonus is their money, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns seems to be the main issue. The author might not be legally wrong, but emotionally and in terms of relationship dynamics, they might be at fault here. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and the impact on their relationship, even if they had the right to spend the money as they wanted.\n"
