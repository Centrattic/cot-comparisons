Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author uses earbuds and then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to talk quieter. The author responds politely but points out her loudness. Then, the woman claims her rights, and the author retaliates by playing a loud music video. The woman storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public behavior. Generally, in public spaces like airports, people are expected to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The woman was watching her show loudly, which is considered rude. The author initially used earbuds, which is appropriate, but then made a phone call. Phone calls in public can be disruptive, but maybe it's more accepted if done quietly. However, the woman's interruption was maybe unwarranted since the author was using earbuds and the call might not have been loud. \n\nThe author's response was to point out the woman's loudness, which is fair since she was violating the norm. Then, when the woman insists she's right, the author retaliates by playing loud music. This action is problematic because it's a form of payback that escalates the situation. Even though the woman started it, the author's action of playing loud music full volume without headphones is also rude and goes against the same norms they were following earlier. \n\nSo, while the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's retaliation makes them equally at fault. The author should have either ignored the situation after a polite reminder or escalated to airport staff instead of retaliating. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their own actions, even if the initial behavior of the woman was inappropriate.\n"
