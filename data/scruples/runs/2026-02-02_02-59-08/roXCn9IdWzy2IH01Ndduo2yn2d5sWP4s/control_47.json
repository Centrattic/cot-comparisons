Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement at the airport between the author and an older lady.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The lady sits next to the author, watches a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then, the author makes a phone call using the earbuds. The lady interrupts to ask the author to talk quietly. The author responds politely, pointing out that the lady's behavior is actually rude. Then the author pretends to agree and plays a music video full volume, which causes the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the author's actions were justified. The lady was being inconsiderate by watching her show loudly in a public place. The author tried to address it politely first. When the lady dismissed the author's point, the author escalated the situation by playing loud music. \n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. The author's initial action of using earbuds and making a call might be within their rights. However, when the author retaliates by playing loud music, that's an escalation. Even though the lady was being rude, the author's response could be seen as taking it too far. The author's actions caused the lady to get angry and leave. \n\nIn public spaces, both parties should consider each other's comfort. While the lady was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music in retaliation is equally inconsiderate. So, the author might be at fault for not handling the situation more calmly. Even if the lady was wrong, the author's actions could be considered a form of revenge, which isn't appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the conflict.\n"
