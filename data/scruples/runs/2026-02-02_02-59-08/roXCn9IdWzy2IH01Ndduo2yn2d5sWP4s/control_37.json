Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady playing her show loudly on an iPad at the airport, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume to retaliate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady was clearly being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is rude in public spaces. The author initially tried to handle it politely by putting on earbuds, which is a reasonable response. When the lady interrupted the author's phone call, the author confronted her, pointing out her own rude behavior. The lady then doubled down, claiming her right to enjoy her show without interruptions.\n\nThe key moment is when the author decided to retaliate by playing a loud music video. While the author had a point about the lady's behavior, retaliating in kind might not be the best approach. Both parties were being rude in their own ways. The lady for not using headphones, and the author for playing loud video. Even though the author was responding to the lady's actions, it's generally expected to maintain civility even when correcting others. The author's action caused the lady to storm off, which escalated the situation. \n\nSo, even though the lady started it, the author's response was also inappropriate. The correct approach would have been to continue using earbuds or perhaps inform airport staff. Retaliating with the same behavior doesn't resolve the issue and makes the author equally at fault. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
