Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport with an older lady who's watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author argues politely and then plays a music video full volume as a response. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The lady is being disruptive by watching her show at a loud volume without headphones. The author tries to handle it calmly by putting in earbuds and then when confronted, they respond with reasoning. The key point here is the author's retaliation by playing a music video loudly. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPublic spaces usually have unspoken rules about noise. Using devices without headphones is generally considered rude, especially in places like airports. The lady violated that, so the author had a reason to be upset. However, when the author was told to quiet their call, they responded by playing a loud music video. Even though they used the same tactic, the author's action was a direct retaliation. \n\nNow, the core issue is whether the author's response was justified. The author's initial reaction was to point out the lady's mistake politely, which is reasonable. But then escalating by playing loud video is a form of revenge and not a calm resolution. Even if the lady was wrong, responding in kind could be seen as equally rude. The author might be within their rights to defend themselves, but the method of response could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the lady had a right to be in the airport, but so does the author. The author's use of earbuds was a good first step. When the lady confronted them, the author's verbal response was appropriate. But then the decision to play loud media as a form of \"taste of her own behavior\" might cross into being disrespectful. It's a tit-for-tat approach which isn't the best way to handle conflicts in public. \n\nSo, even though the lady started it, the author's retaliation could be seen as equally inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it. However, some might argue that it's a justified response to a rude action. But generally, responding with a similar public disruption is not considered appropriate. Hence, the answer might lean towards A (yes), as the author took a retaliatory action that was disrespectful, even if the initial issue was the lady's fault.\n"
