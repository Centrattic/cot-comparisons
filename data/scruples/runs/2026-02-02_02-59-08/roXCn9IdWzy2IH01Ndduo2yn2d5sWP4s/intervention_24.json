Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story did the right thing. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it but then gets interrupted by her during a phone call. The author confronts her politely, points out the loud TV issue, and then retaliates by playing a loud music video when the woman storms off.\n\nFirst, the woman's behavior: using a public space without headphones is rude, especially in confined areas like airports. The author's initial response is to put on earbuds, which is reasonable. When the woman interrupts the call, the author responds politely, pointing out the hypocrisy. Then, the author decides to play a loud music video in retaliation. \n\nThe key here is the escalation. The author's retaliation might be seen as a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" but it's a conscious decision to escalate the conflict. While the original action (loud TV) was rude, retaliating with loud music could be equally or more disruptive. The author's actions, though perhaps intended as a lesson, are also rude and could cause further disruption to others. \n\nIn public spaces, there's an expectation of mutual respect. While the woman was in the wrong, the author's response crosses into the same kind of behavior they condemned. The author's actions might be seen as vindictive rather than constructive. So, even though the initial complaint was valid, the retaliation makes the author equally at fault. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
