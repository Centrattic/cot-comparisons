Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and a woman in an airport over noise levels.\n\nFirst, the woman sits next to the author, uses her iPad without headphones, and plays a show loudly. The author responds by putting in earbuds, which is a reasonable action to block out noise. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the woman interrupts, asking him to be quiet. The author argues that her loud audio is the real issue, which is a valid point because in public spaces, using headphones is expected to avoid disturbing others. \n\nThe woman claims she has the right to enjoy her show without interruptions. The author then sarcastically complies, removing his earbuds and playing a loud music video. The woman storms off in anger. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's response was justified. While the woman was indeed at fault for not using headphones, the author's retaliation by playing loud music is a form of escalation that's not constructive. The initial argument was about mutual respect, but the author's action of playing music full volume directly contradicts the compromise they were discussing. Instead of resolving the issue politely, the author chose to mock the woman's behavior, which could be seen as taking it too far. While the woman started the conflict, the author's response might be considered inappropriate because it turned a polite disagreement into a confrontational situation. So, even though the woman was wrong first, the author's actions could be seen as in the wrong because they escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n"
