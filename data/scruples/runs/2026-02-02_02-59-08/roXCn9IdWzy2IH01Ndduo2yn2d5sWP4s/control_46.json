Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport. An older lady sits next to the author, watches a show on her iPad loudly. The author puts on earbuds but then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts and tells the author to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out that the lady is the one being loud and then, as a joke or retaliation, plays a video full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, the lady was indeed being rude by watching a show loudly in public. Airports are public spaces where people expect quiet environments, so using headphones is standard. The author's initial reaction of using earbuds and ignoring the noise seems reasonable. When the lady confronts the author, the author correctly points out the lady's wrongdoing. However, the key issue is the author's response after agreeing they're wrong. The author says they're wrong, then plays a music video loudly. Even though the author was corrected the lady's behavior, they took it a step further by doing the same thing. This seems like retaliation, which could be seen as escalating the situation. Even if it was meant as a joke or to show her hypocrisy, it's not a respectful way to handle the conflict. The lady's right to watch her show without headphones might be debatable, but the author's action of playing loud video after the confrontation is definitely rude and unprofessional. So, even though the lady was in the wrong initially, the author's response crosses a line. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their retaliatory action.\n"
