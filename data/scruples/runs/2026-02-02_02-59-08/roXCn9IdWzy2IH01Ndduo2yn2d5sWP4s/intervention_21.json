      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about the author and an older lady at the airport. The lady is watching a show loudly, and the author is using earbuds. Then the author makes a phone call, which the lady interrupts by asking them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that the lady's behavior is more disruptive, and then as a \"taste of her own medicine,\" the author plays a music video loudly on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who is in the wrong. The initial problem is the lady's loud iPad. The author uses earbuds first, which is the right move, but then when she's asked to be quiet during a call, the author confronts her. The author's response seems justified because making a phone call isn't inherently rude, and the lady's volume is the issue. However, the author's retaliation by playing loud music is where it gets tricky. \n\nEven though the lady was being inconsiderate, the author's reaction of playing loud music might be seen as escalating the conflict. The author is using a kind of \"you too\" argument, but the actions taken (playing music loudly) are similar to the lady's behavior. So, while the lady started it, the author's response could be seen as equally inconsiderate. The question is whether the author's retaliation is justified or if it's just a tit-for-tat approach that's not appropriate in a public setting. \n\nPublic spaces do require mutual respect. Even if someone else is being rude, responding with similar behavior might not be the best approach. The author could have handled it differently, but the act of retaliating with loud noise mirrors the problem they were accusing the lady of. So, while the lady was definitely at fault first, the author's action might be seen as equally wrong because they chose to engage in the same disruptive behavior. Therefore, the author's action, though a form of \"getting back\" at the lady, isn't justified and could be considered in the wrong.\n"
