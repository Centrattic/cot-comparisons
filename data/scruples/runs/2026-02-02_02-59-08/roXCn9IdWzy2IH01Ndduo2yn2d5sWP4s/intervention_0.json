Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly as well. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The older lady is being inconsiderate by using her iPad without headphones, which is disruptive in a public space. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by defending their action and then retaliates by playing loud music. \n\nThe key points here are about public etiquette and proportionality in response. The woman's behavior is rude, but the author's retaliation could be seen as escalating the situation. Even though the author was justified in pointing out the woman's inconsiderate behavior, playing loud music in response might be seen as equally rude. Retaliation with the same behavior doesn't resolve the issue and can make the situation worse. \n\nThe author's action of playing loud music despite having earbuds might be considered an overreaction. While the woman was in the wrong first, the author's response could be seen as equally inconsiderate. So, even if the initial complaint was valid, the way the author handled it might be problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a similar manner instead of resolving the conflict politely.\n"
