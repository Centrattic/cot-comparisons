Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, instead of confronting her directly, decides to play a music video on their own device after being asked to stop their phone call. The woman then gets angry and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was clearly being inconsiderate by using her iPad without headphones. The author initially tried to handle it politely by putting in earbuds and then by pointing out the problem. When the woman complained, the author responded by pointing out her rudeness. Then, the author escalated the situation by playing loud music themselves as a form of retaliation. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's response was justified. The woman was wrong in not using headphones, but the author's retaliation by playing loud music could be seen as equally rude. Even though the author was defending their own behavior, using the same inconsiderate action (playing loud music) might not be the right approach. It's possible that the author's response was a form of giving the woman a taste of her own medicine, but this doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nIn public spaces, it's generally expected to be considerate of others. If the author wanted to teach the woman a lesson, there might be more appropriate ways to do so, like calmly explaining the issue without reciprocating the loud behavior. The author's action could be seen as escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was justified because the woman was being rude first. But in terms of right and wrong, retaliation with similar inconsiderate actions is still wrong, regardless of the provocation. The author's actions could have been a way to make a point, but it's not a justified response in a public setting where mutual respect is expected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to play loud music in response was inappropriate and rude, making them at fault even though the initial provocation was from the other party.\n"
