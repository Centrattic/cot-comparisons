Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds but then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely, pointing out the lady's loud volume is the issue. Then, he takes it further by playing a music video full volume, causing her to leave angry.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but wants confirmation. Let's consider the moral and social norms here. \n\nFirst, the lady was being loud, which is rude in public. The author first tries to ignore it, which is reasonable. Then, when he makes a call, she confronts him. The author's response is to point out her own behavior, which is fair. But then he escalates the situation by playing his own loud video. Even though he was defending himself, retaliating with similar behavior might cross the line. \n\nEven if the lady was in the wrong initially, the author's response could be seen as a form of revenge. While it's true she was being rude, playing loud media in return might not be the right way to handle it. The author's actions led to a confrontation and someone leaving upset. So, even if the author had a point, his method of response could be considered wrong. \n\nIn public spaces, mutual consideration is usually expected. Retaliation can be seen as equally rude, even if the original action was worse. The author's actions might be seen as a justifiable stand, but playing loud music in response is likely to be viewed as escalating the conflict unnecessarily. So, the author's actions, while perhaps in response to the lady's rudeness, may be in the wrong because they caused further disruption and an angry reaction.\n"
