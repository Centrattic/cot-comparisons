Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is at the airport, and an older lady sits next to them and watches a show on her iPad loudly. The person puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then when they make a phone call, the lady interrupts and tells them to talk quietly. The person responds by telling her that watching TV loudly is rude and suggests people use headphones. The lady argues she has a right, and the person sarcastically agrees, then plays a music video full volume on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette. Both parties are doing something that's considered rude in public. The lady is using her device on loud, which most people would agree is impolite. The person initially tries to ignore it, then when confronted, they retaliate by doing the same. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The lady started by being rude, but the author's response was to escalate the situation by playing something loudly as well. Even though the author was defending their phone call (which is generally acceptable), retaliating by playing loud media might cross into being equally rude. So even if the lady was wrong first, the author's action of playing their own loud video is also rude. \n\nIn public spaces, the expectation is that people should respect others by not causing disturbances. While the lady was wrong for the initial behavior, the author's retaliation isn't justified. It's a tit-for-tat situation, but both actions are against social norms. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. Since the author chose to respond with the same behavior, even if it was in response, they are also at fault for escalating the conflict in a public setting. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because retaliating with the same behavior is not acceptable, even if the other person was wrong first. The proper response would be to address the issue politely but not to escalate it by doing the same thing.\n"
