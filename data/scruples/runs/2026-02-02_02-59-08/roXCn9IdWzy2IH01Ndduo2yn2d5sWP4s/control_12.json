Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was in the wrong when they retaliated against the woman who was being loud on her iPad. \n\nFirst, the scenario: the woman is in the airport, a lady sits next to her, watches a show loudly. The author uses earbuds and ignores it until she makes a phone call. The woman interrupts, asking her to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the woman's loud TV and then, in a sarcastic way, plays loud music herself, leading the woman to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette. Both parties are in a public space where noise levels matter. The woman starts by being disruptive, which is clearly rude. The author initially tries to ignore it, which is a reasonable first step. When confronted, the author defends herself by pointing out the woman's own mistake. Then, instead of de-escalating, the author escalates by playing loud music, which is her retaliation.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The woman was indeed being rude first, but the author's response was to copy the behavior. While the author's initial defense might be seen as justified, the act of playing loud music in retaliation is equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, so even if someone is at fault, retaliating in kind doesn't solve the problem and can make it worse. The author's action could be seen as not the wrong choice in terms of responding to the initial rudeness, but the method of doing so by mirroring the behavior might be considered equally inappropriate. So, the answer hinges on whether retaliation is acceptable. If the author's action is considered provocation rather than self-defense, then she might be at fault. Alternatively, if it's seen as a justified comeuppance, then not. However, in terms of right and wrong, both parties acted in ways that disrupted others, but the author's response was a direct escalation. Therefore, the author could be seen as equally at fault for the escalation, even if the initial problem was the woman's. So the answer might be A, but there's nuance here. Wait, the options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no). Considering that the author's action was a direct response to the woman's behavior, but in public settings, using loud devices is against norms. The woman was wrong first, but the author's retaliation is also against the norms. So both are wrong, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author chose to retaliate in kind, which is equally rude, then technically, the author is also in the wrong. Hence, answer A.\n"
