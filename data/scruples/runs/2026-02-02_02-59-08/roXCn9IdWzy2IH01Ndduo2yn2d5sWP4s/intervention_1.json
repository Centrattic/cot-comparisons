Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the story did something wrong. The scenario is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman asks him to talk quietly. The author responds politely, points out her volume issue, and then when she accuses him of being rude, he plays a music video loudly on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, the initial situation: the woman is using a device without headphones, so her actions are indeed disruptive in a public space. The author's first reaction is to put on earbuds, which is a reasonable self-remedy. Then, when she interrupts his call, he confronts her politely, which seems fair. However, the key point is his retaliation. He escalates the situation by playing music loudly in response to her, even after agreeing he was wrong. Even though he might have a point about her being rude, his action of playing the video at full volume is a direct and disproportionate response. Public spaces require mutual respect; while the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's retaliation crosses a line. Retaliation isn't a constructive solution and can be seen as equally rude. So, even if he felt justified, his action was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for responding with similar disruptive behavior.\n"
