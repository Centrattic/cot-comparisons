Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about someone in an airport dealing with a loud woman watching a show. The author initially ignores the noise but then uses earbuds to make a call. The woman interrupts and tells them to be quiet. The author responds politely, points out the woman's loudness, and then plays a music video full volume on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions were wrong. The main points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The woman was being loud, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author, instead of just complying with the request to be quiet, decides to mirror the woman's behavior as a form of revenge or to show her the fault in her actions.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's response was appropriate. While the woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones, the author's retaliation by playing loud music might escalate the situation. Even though the author was pointing out the hypocrisy, taking the same action could be seen as equally rude. Both parties were being disruptive, but the author's actions might be seen as a deliberate provocation rather than a peaceful resolution.\n\nIn public spaces, the expectation is to be respectful of others' space and noise levels. While the woman was wrong to be loud, the author's response of playing loud music could be considered a breach of the same courtesy. So even if the author was trying to show the woman her mistake, the method might be seen as overreacting. Therefore, the author's action could be viewed as wrong because it didn't resolve the issue respectfully and instead caused more conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they retaliated in a way that's equally disruptive, even if they had a point initially.\n"
