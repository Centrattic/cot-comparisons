Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores her but then when she interrupts during a phone call, the author retaliates by playing a music video loudly. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the assistant's opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The lady was using her iPad loudly, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author used earbuds to avoid the noise and then made a phone call, which the lady found disruptive. The author's response was to play a music video loudly without earbuds, leading to the lady leaving in anger.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual rudeness. The lady's initial action was disruptive, so the author had a reason to be upset. However, the author's retaliation by playing loud media was also rude and escalated the situation. While the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response was equally inconsiderate. The author's action of playing music loudly in response isn't acceptable either, as it's a public space where noise should be minimized. \n\nEven though the lady started it, the author's retaliation doesn't justify their own rude behavior. The appropriate action would have been to address the issue calmly without reciprocating the noise. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for responding in kind rather than maintaining composure and perhaps asking the lady to lower her volume again or moving away. The fact that the author admitted fault initially but then took a vengeful action shows a lack of self-control. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
