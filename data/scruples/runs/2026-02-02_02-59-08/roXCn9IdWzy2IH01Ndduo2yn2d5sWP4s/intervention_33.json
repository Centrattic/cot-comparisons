Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, he responds by playing a music video full volume on his iPad, which makes her storm off.\n\nThe author's actions here are a bit of a tit-for-tat response. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is a common etiquette in public places. The author used earbuds to avoid the noise but when confronted, he decided to play a video loudly. That seems like a disproportionate reaction. Even though the lady was at fault, retaliating by doing the same (or worse) might not be the right approach. It's like the old saying, \"Don't make someone else angry by doing what they did to you.\" \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, which makes sense. The key point is about escalation. The lady's behavior was rude, but the author's response was also rude. It's a situation where both parties acted inconsiderately, but the author's action directly caused the lady to get up and leave. So, while the lady started the problem, the author's response is the immediate cause of the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
