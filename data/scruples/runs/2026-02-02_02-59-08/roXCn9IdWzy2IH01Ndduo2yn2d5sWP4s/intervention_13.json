Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is loudly watching a show on her iPad. The author uses earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask the author to speak quieter. The author responds politely, points out the woman's loudness, and then retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which is common in public places. The author tried to be polite and even pointed out the issue. However, the author's retaliation by playing the music video full volume seems to escalate the situation. While the author might feel justified in pointing out hypocrisy, responding in kind can be seen as equally rude. Public spaces do require mutual respect, and reacting with the same rude behavior might not be the best approach, even if provoked. So, while the woman started it, the author's action could be seen as wrong because it's not resolving the issue but escalating it. The correct answer here is A (yes, in the wrong) because the author's response was inappropriate and unprofessional, even if they had a point initially.\n"
