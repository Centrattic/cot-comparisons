Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author is making a phone call. The woman interrupts the author to ask him to be quieter. The author responds by pointing out that her behavior is actually the issue, and then retaliates by playing a music video loudly, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and etiquette in public spaces. Generally, airports are public areas where people are expected to be considerate of others. Using electronic devices without headphones can disturb others, so the woman's initial action might be considered rude. However, the author's response to her complaint was to play music loudly, which could be seen as a form of retaliation.\n\nI should evaluate both parties' actions. The woman didn't use headphones, which is against common etiquette. The author, when confronted, instead of just stopping the call or politely explaining, chose to escalate the situation by playing loud music. Even though the author might feel justified because the woman was being inconsiderate, retaliation with similar behavior isn't usually considered the right approach. It could be seen as an overreaction, even if the initial problem was the woman's fault. The author's action of playing music loudly might have been a way to teach a lesson, but it's not a socially accepted method. So, while the woman started it, the author's response might still be considered inappropriate in a public setting. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not handling the situation more calmly and instead choosing to retaliate.\n"
