Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where an older woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, the woman interrupts the author's phone call, asking him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loud volume and then, in a twist, plays a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The woman was using her iPad loudly in a public space. The author uses earbuds to avoid the noise, which is a reasonable action. Then, when she interrupts his call, he confronts her politely. His response is valid because public spaces require consideration for others. However, his retaliation by playing loud music seems to escalate the situation. \n\nThe author's initial actions (using earbuds) are passive but justified. The woman's behavior is indeed inconsiderate. However, when the author plays the music video, even if it's a form of teaching her a lesson, it's not a proportional or appropriate response. Retaliation with similar inconsiderate behavior doesn't resolve the issue and could be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo, while the woman was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response crosses the line. It's important to address inconsiderate behavior respectfully but not to mirror it. The author's action is a form of tit-for-tat, which might be satisfying in the moment but isn't a mature way to handle the situation. \n\nTherefore, even though the woman was at fault, the author's decision to play loud music makes him the one in the wrong. The correct answer should be A, but wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Let me double-check. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes) because his retaliatory action was inappropriate, even if the woman was wrong first.\n"
