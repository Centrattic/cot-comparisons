Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is wrong. The scenario involves a person at an airport dealing with someone else being loud on an iPad. The main conflict here is about mutual accusations of rudeness.\n\nSo the older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds politely but points out the lady's rudeness. The key part is when the author, in a sarcastic manner, says they're wrong and proceeds to play a music video loudly, causing the lady to leave in anger.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong. Let me consider the actions. The author's response was to play loud music after the lady's complaint. Even though the author was being polite initially, retaliating with loud music might escalate the situation. The airport is a public space where people expect certain norms of behavior. While the lady was indeed being loud, the author's response could be seen as equally rude. The author's action of playing music full volume without earbuds is a direct retaliation, which might be considered inappropriate because it's a public space where mutual respect is expected. So even if the initial action of the lady was wrong, the author's response might cross the line into being inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not maintaining composure and instead responding in kind. So the answer would be A.\n"
