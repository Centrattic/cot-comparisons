Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is at an airport, right? The user is sitting next to an older lady who's watching a show on her iPad loudly. The user puts in earbuds and ignores it initially. Then when the user makes a phone call using earbuds, the lady interrupts and asks them to be quiet. The user responds by pointing out that the lady's own behavior is rude, and then as a form of retaliation, the user plays a music video full volume on their own iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking for opinions. The initial answer given by the person is that they think the author is in the wrong, but they want others' thoughts.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The lady was indeed being inconsiderate by playing her show loudly without headphones. That's generally frowned upon in public spaces because it affects others. The user's first reaction is to use earbuds, which is a reasonable way to handle the situation without confrontation. Then when the lady interrupts during the phone call, the user's response is to point out her own rudeness, which could be seen as a fair rebuttal. But the user then escalates the situation by playing a loud music video, which is a direct and public retaliation. \n\nThe key issue here is the escalation. While the lady was at fault initially, the user's response of playing loud music is a tit-for-tat approach that creates a hostile environment. Even if the user believes they were justified, using the same method of inconsiderate behavior (loud noise) as the lady did could be seen as equally wrong. It's a cycle where both parties engage in disruptive actions. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, resolving conflicts in public should ideally be done through polite communication or, if necessary, involving an authority. Retaliating with the same kind of behavior doesn't address the root issue and can lead to a worse outcome, as seen here with the lady storming off. The user's action, while perhaps a humorous or satisfying response, is still inconsiderate and escalates the conflict. \n\nTherefore, even though the lady started the problem, the user's retaliation makes them equally at fault in terms of public conduct. So the author is in the wrong because they responded in a way that mirrored the initial inconsiderate behavior, thereby escalating the situation unnecessarily.\n"
