Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe setup is that an older lady sits next to them at the airport, watches her show on an iPad very loudly. The writer initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the writer makes a phone call, the lady interrupts them, asking them to talk quietly so she can hear her show. The writer responds by telling her that making a phone call isn't rude, but watching a show loudly is, which is why people use headphones. The lady insists she has the right to enjoy her show. Then the writer takes out their own iPad and plays a music video full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, let's break down the actions. The lady is being inconsiderate by not using headphones, which the writer points out. The writer then gets interrupted and responds by pointing out the lady's rudeness. Then, after the lady accuses the writer of being rude, the writer retaliates by playing a loud music video. The key is whether the writer's retaliation was appropriate or if it crossed a line.\n\nThe writer's initial response was to point out the lady's behavior, which is reasonable. But when the lady continues, the writer escalates the situation by playing loud audio themselves. This seems like a direct retaliation. Even though the lady was being inconsiderate, the writer's action of playing loud music on their own device could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces often have rules about using headphones for media, and the writer violated that by playing it out loud. The lady might have been wrong for not using headphones, but the writer's response was also inappropriate. So, in this case, the writer's action of retaliating with their own loud behavior was wrong, even if the initial issue was the lady's fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
