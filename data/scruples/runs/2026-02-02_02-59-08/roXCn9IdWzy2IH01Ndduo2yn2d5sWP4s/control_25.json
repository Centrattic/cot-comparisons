Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author, instead of confronting her, puts on earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loudness and then retaliates by playing a music video full volume, causing her to leave.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. The woman was using her device loudly, which is indeed rude in public spaces. The author tried to handle it politely by using earbuds and then addressing the issue calmly. However, when the woman criticized the phone call, the author escalated the situation by playing loud music. \n\nNow, while the woman was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music seems like a form of revenge. Even if the author felt justified, retaliating in kind might not be the right approach. The author could have continued to ignore the situation or perhaps asked her politely again to lower the volume. Instead, by playing loud music, the author mirrored the woman's behavior, making it a cycle of rudeness. \n\nIn public settings, it's important to maintain civility. The initial action of the woman was wrong, but the author's response, while perhaps a form of karma, doesn't set a good example. It's possible that the author's actions led to a worse outcome, as the woman left in anger. So, while the woman started it, the author's decision to retaliate could be seen as equally wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards 'Yes' because the author chose to respond with the same behavior they criticized.\n"
