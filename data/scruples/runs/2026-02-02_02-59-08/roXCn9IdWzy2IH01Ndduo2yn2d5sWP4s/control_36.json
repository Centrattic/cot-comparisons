Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author first ignores her and puts in earbuds. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask to talk quieter. The author responds politely but then points out the lady's loudness. The lady claims she has the right, and the author sarcastically agrees and then plays a music video loudly, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm, the key here is the sequence of actions. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author tried to handle it politely, then pointed out the lady's rudeness. Then, after the lady's accusation, the author's retort was to play loud video. So, the author's action might be seen as a tit-for-tat. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the lady was definitely at fault for not using headphones. The author was within their rights to make a phone call, as that's allowed in airports. The author's response to the lady's complaint was justified because they highlighted the lady's own rude behavior. But the final action of playing loud music seems like retaliation. Even though the author was in the right initially, the act of playing loud music themselves is also inconsiderate. So the author's action was a direct response, but it's a form of revenge. \n\nIn public spaces, even if someone else is being rude, responding with similar behavior could escalate things and is still considered rude. The author's initial response was polite and appropriate, but the final action of playing loud music crosses into their own rudeness. Therefore, the author's action here is not justified. So the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they responded with their own inconsiderate behavior.\n"
