Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by retaliating against the lady who was being loud on her iPad in the airport.\n\nFirst, the lady started by watching a show loudly. The author initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupted the author's phone call, the author responded politely but pointed out her loud behavior. The lady then accused the author of being rude. The author then escalated by playing a loud music video on their own iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nNow, the key points here are about public conduct and mutual respect. Both parties were in a public space where quiet behavior is expected. The lady's initial action was indeed rude by not using headphones. The author's first response was appropriate\u2014using earbuds and politely addressing the issue. However, when the author retaliated by playing loud music, that's where the problem lies. Retaliation with loud noise isn't a solution; it's just another form of public disruption. Even if the author felt wronged, responding in kind doesn't make it right. Both parties have an obligation to maintain a respectful environment. So, while the lady was wrong first, the author's action of playing loud music was also inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation rather than de-escalating it.\n"
