Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it but then when the woman asks them to use their earbuds during a phone call, the author responds by playing a music video loudly in retaliation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The woman is being disruptive by watching her show at full volume in a public space where headphones are typically used. The author, instead of addressing the issue calmly, uses sarcasm and then escalates the situation by playing a loud video in response. The key here is whether the author's retaliation is justified or if it crosses into being in the wrong.\n\nThe woman's initial behavior is definitely rude, but public spaces have norms about using headphones. The author's response, while humorous, is a form of revenge. However, in a public setting, playing loud videos is also disruptive. The author's actions were a deliberate provocation, which might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they were reacting to someone else's rudeness. \n\nLegally, both might have rights since it's a public area, but socially, the expectation is to be considerate. The author's reaction was disproportionate. Instead of addressing the issue directly or calmly, they chose to escalate it. Even though the woman was wrong first, the author's own actions were equally disruptive. So, the author is in the wrong because they responded in a way that was also rude and counterproductive, even if they felt justified.\n"
