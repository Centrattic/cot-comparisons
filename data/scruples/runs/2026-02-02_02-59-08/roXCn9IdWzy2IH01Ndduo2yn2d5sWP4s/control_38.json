Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, both parties did something that could be considered rude. The woman was using her device without headphones, which is disruptive in a public space. The author initially tried to ignore it but then made a phone call. When confronted, the author argued back and then escalated the situation by playing a loud music video. \n\nThe key points here are public behavior and mutual respect. The woman was indeed being inconsiderate by not using headphones. However, the author's response of playing loud music in retaliation is also inappropriate. Even though the author's actions were a form of payback, it's not a socially acceptable way to handle a conflict. \n\nIn public spaces, the expectation is to be considerate of others. Both parties violated that, but the author's escalation might be seen as more aggressive because they directly responded with their own loud behavior. However, the initial problem was the woman's loud show. The author's actions were a form of tit-for-tat, which is understandable but not justified. \n\nLegally and socially, both are at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author chose to retaliate in a way that matches the woman's disruption, they are equally at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response wasn't the correct way to handle the situation. Even if the woman was being rude, the author's method of responding wasn't appropriate; they should have perhaps escalated to an authority instead of retaliating.\n"
