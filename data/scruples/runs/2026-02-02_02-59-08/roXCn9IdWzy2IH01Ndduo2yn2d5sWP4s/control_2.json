Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The scenario involves a person in an airport who is annoyed by a woman watching a show loudly. The author initially tries to ignore it by using earbuds and then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts him to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely but points out her loud volume. She insists she's right, and then he retaliates by playing a loud music video, causing her to leave.\n\nFirst, both parties were disruptive in their own ways. The woman was using her iPad loudly, which is indeed rude in public. The author, when asked to be quiet, makes a point about her behavior, which is a valid response. However, when he responds by playing music loudly, that's a direct retaliation. Even though he was reacting to her initial rudeness, escalating the situation by doing the same thing is problematic. Public spaces require mutual respect; while the woman was wrong, the author's response was equally disruptive. So, while the woman started it, the author's action of playing loud music is also inconsiderate and escalates the conflict. Therefore, he's not in the right either.\n"
