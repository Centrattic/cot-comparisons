Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the lady interrupts and tells the author to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out that her loud show is actually rude and that's why people use headphones. Then the author plays a music video full volume on their own iPad without earbuds, causing the lady to get angry and storm off.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. First, the lady is being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author tries to address it politely but is met with defensiveness. The author then decides to retaliate by doing the same thing, but in a more public way. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for this retaliation.\n\nSo, the author's initial action was to use earbuds and ignore the noise, which seems reasonable. When confronted, they tried to explain the issue but the lady didn't back down. The author's response was to mirror the behavior, which escalated the situation. Now, retaliation in a public setting like this\u2014especially when the original issue was about being considerate\u2014might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the lady was wrong, responding with the same inconsiderate action (playing loud music) could be considered equally rude. The author's point was to show the lady her own behavior, but doing so by acting out the same behavior they criticized might not be the right approach. It's a form of tit-for-tat, which can be seen as unprofessional or immature. So, even if the lady was at fault first, the author's retaliation could be seen as wrong because they didn't resolve the issue respectfully. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
