Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author of the story uses earbuds and tries to make a phone call, but the woman interrupts, asking him to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out her loud behavior and then retaliates by playing a music video loudly on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was indeed using a device without headphones, which can be disruptive in public. However, interrupting someone on a phone call is also rude. The author's initial reaction was to politely ask her to lower her volume, but when she dismissed him, he escalated the situation by playing loud music. This retaliation, while humorous, is a clear act of revenge rather than a calm resolution. \n\nLegally, both parties have the right to be in the airport, but public spaces require consideration. Playing loud music in response to someone else's loudness isn't justifying the initial behavior. The author's action was a direct response to her, but it's still a form of public disruption. Even though the woman started it, the author's choice to retaliate in kind makes him equally at fault. \n\nThe key point here is that mutual rudeness doesn't make either side right. The author could have chosen to ignore the situation further or find another way to address it without reciprocating the noise. By playing music loudly, he escalated the conflict and caused her to leave angrily. So, even if the woman was wrong first, the author's action was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
