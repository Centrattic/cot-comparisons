Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then when making a phone call, the woman interrupts to ask him to be quiet. He responds by pointing out her loudness and then plays a music video full volume, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to analyze both sides. The woman was clearly being inconsiderate by playing her device loudly in public. The author's initial response was to put in earbuds and ignore it, which is reasonable. When the woman confronts him during his phone call, he points out her behavior, which is fair because phone calls on speaker are more disruptive than personal devices. However, the author's retaliation by playing a music video full volume seems excessive. Even if he was right about her being loud, responding in kind by playing something himself might not be the best approach. It could be seen as taking the conflict too far. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. While the woman was wrong for not using headphones, the author's response might escalate the situation unnecessarily. So, there's a balance here. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because the woman had no right to be so loud, but his reaction might be over the top. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, yes, then because his actions were retaliatory and not a proper response. If B, no, because he was defending against her initial rudeness. It's a bit of a gray area, but in terms of social norms, even if someone is being rude, responding with similar rude behavior isn't acceptable. So the author's action of playing loud music was wrong, making him at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
