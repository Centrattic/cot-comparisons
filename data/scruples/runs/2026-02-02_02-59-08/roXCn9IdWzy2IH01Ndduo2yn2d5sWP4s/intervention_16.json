Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching her iPad loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being told off. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The older lady is using her iPad without headphones, which is disruptive. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask them to be quiet. The author responds by telling her that her loud behavior is rude. The lady claims she has the right to enjoy her show. Then the author, in a sarcastic way, plays a music video loudly, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nSo the key points here are: both parties are being disruptive, but the author escalated the situation by mocking the lady's behavior. The question is whether the author's retaliation was justified or went too far.\n\nPublic spaces do require mutual respect. The lady was wrong to watch her show loudly, but the author's response might have been a form of revenge rather than a solution. While the author's initial reaction was to point out the lady's mistake, the subsequent action of playing loud music is a direct retaliation. Even if the author is correct that the lady's behavior was rude, responding in kind isn't the best approach. It could be seen as provoking further conflict instead of resolving it. The author's actions might be considered inconsiderate, even if they were a reaction to the lady's behavior. So, the author might be in the wrong for not resolving the issue calmly and instead escalating it. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
