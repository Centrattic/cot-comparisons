Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The scenario is about a person responding to someone else's loud behavior in an airport. The older lady is watching a show loudly, and the author, after being asked to be quiet during a phone call, retaliates by playing a music video loud.\n\nFirst, the lady's initial action: watching a show on an iPad without headphones in a public area is indeed rude. Public spaces usually expect people to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The author's first reaction was to put in earbuds and ignore it, which is reasonable.\n\nThen the lady confronts the author about their phone call. The author was polite but pointed out the lady's own loud behavior. The lady insists she's right, so the author then plays a loud music video in response. This is where the author's actions become problematic. Even though the lady was wrong, retaliating in kind by making noise yourself creates a cycle of rudeness. Both parties are now contributing to the problem. The author's action was a direct response but crosses into being equally rude. While the lady started it, the author's retaliation is their fault. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they responded in a way that escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it.\n"
