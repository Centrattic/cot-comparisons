Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the airport situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a conflict over noise levels. \n\nFirst, the older lady is watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author puts in earbuds to avoid the noise. Then, when making a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loud volume and then, in a sarcastic manner, agrees she's right and plays a loud music video on his own device, causing her to leave angry.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about public etiquette and retaliation. The lady was clearly being inconsiderate by not using headphones. The author's initial reaction was to point that out politely. But then, after agreeing she's right sarcastically, he retaliates by playing loud music. Even though the lady was at fault, the author's response escalates the situation. Retaliation, even if justified in feeling, isn't considered appropriate in public settings. The author's actions could be seen as equally rude and disruptive. So while the lady was wrong first, the author's response crosses a line. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions were a form of revenge rather than a polite resolution.\n"
