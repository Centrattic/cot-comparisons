Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person in an airport who's being disturbed by a loud iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds, then makes a phone call and gets reprimanded by the woman. The author then responds by playing a music video loudly on their own iPad, causing the woman to leave angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed rude in a public space. The author, after being told to be quiet by the woman, points out that the woman's behavior is also inconsiderate. Then, the author retaliates by playing loud music. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is proportionality and escalation. The author's initial reaction was to point out the woman's mistake, which is reasonable. However, retaliating by playing loud music mirrors the woman's behavior. Even though the author was right to point out the woman's wrongdoing, the act of responding in kind might not be acceptable because it escalates the conflict and can be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo, while the woman was wrong first, the author's response could be considered tit-for-tat, which might not be the best approach in a public setting. It's about whether the author's action was justified as a form of teaching the woman a lesson or if it's just as inconsiderate. The author's action caused the woman to storm off, which is a negative outcome. \n\nIn many social contexts, responding to bad behavior by doing the same thing isn't considered the right approach. It's often better to de-escalate. So, even though the author had a point, the method of responding by playing loud music might be seen as in the wrong because it's not addressing the issue constructively. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
