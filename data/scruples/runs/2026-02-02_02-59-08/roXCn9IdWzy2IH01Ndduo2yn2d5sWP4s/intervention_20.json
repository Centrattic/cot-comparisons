Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for responding to the loud woman by playing a music video full volume. \n\nFirst, the situation starts with the older lady watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, there's a confrontation. The author argues that the lady's loud behavior is rude and that using headphones is the solution. The lady claims her right to enjoy her show. The author then plays a loud music video in response, leading the lady to leave angry.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author's initial response to the loud show was to use earbuds, which is reasonable. However, when confronted, the author escalates the situation by playing loud music. Even though the author points out the lady's wrongdoing, retaliating by doing the same thing (loud audio) isn't a constructive response. It's a form of tit-for-tat that escalates conflict rather than resolving it. \n\nIn public spaces, both parties should consider others' comfort. The lady should have used headphones, but the author's retaliation is equally inconsiderate. While the lady was wrong first, the author's response is also inappropriate. So, even if the original action was justified, the retaliation makes the author at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
