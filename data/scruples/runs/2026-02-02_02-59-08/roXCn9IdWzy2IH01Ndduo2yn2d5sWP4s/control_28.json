Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds, then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts him to ask him to be quiet. The author responds politely but points out her loudness. Then, the lady claims she has the right to enjoy her show. The author then plays a music video full volume, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady was loud, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author's response to her interruption was to point out her behavior, which is a reasonable reaction. However, the author then took it a step further by playing a video full volume, which directly mirrored the lady's behavior. This seems like an act of retaliation rather than a polite resolution. \n\nPublic spaces have norms about not disturbing others, which means both parties should use headphones. The lady violated this norm first, but the author's response escalated the situation. Retaliation with loud noise can be seen as equally rude, even if it's a form of \"taste of their own medicine.\" The author's action likely crossed the line from a justified response to an act of revenge, which makes them at fault for escalating the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they responded with similar disruptive behavior instead of maintaining composure or finding a more constructive solution.\n"
