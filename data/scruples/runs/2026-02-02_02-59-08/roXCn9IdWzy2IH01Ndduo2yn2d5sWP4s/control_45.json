Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at an airport. The author is sitting next to an older lady who's watching a show on her iPad without headphones, so it's loud. The author puts in earbuds, which probably mutes the sound from their own phone. Then the author makes a phone call, and the lady gets annoyed because she can hear the call and asks them to be quieter.\n\nThe author responds by pointing out that she's the one being loud without headphones, and that phone calls aren't as disruptive because you can hear them from a distance. The lady insists she's right, and the author sarcastically agrees, then plays a music video full volume on their own device, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nHmm. So the key here is about public etiquette. Both parties are being disruptive, but in different ways. The lady is using her device without headphones, which is generally considered rude because it affects others. The author is making a phone call, which can also be disruptive, but maybe less so if done quietly. However, when the lady confronts the author, the author's response escalates the situation by playing a loud music video. \n\nThe author's actions in retaliation might be seen as a form of tit-for-tat, but is that acceptable? While the lady was definitely at fault for not using headphones, the author's response of playing loud music could be seen as equally inconsiderate. Retaliation in public spaces can be problematic because it doesn't resolve the issue and might cause more conflict. The author could have addressed the issue without escalating it, maybe by calmly explaining the problem again or reporting to airport staff. \n\nSo, even though the lady was wrong first, the author's action of playing loud music was also disruptive and unprofessional. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more maturely, even if the initial problem was the lady's fault.\n"
