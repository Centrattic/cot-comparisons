Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask to talk quietly, the author responds politely but then later plays a music video full volume on their own iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each party's actions. The lady was being loud with her iPad, which is generally considered rude in public places where people expect quiet. The author's first response was to put in earbuds, which is a reasonable way to handle the situation without confrontation. When the lady interrupted the call, the author calmly explained that the lady's loud behavior was the real issue. The author then sarcastically complies with the lady's request by playing loud music themselves, which escalates the situation.\n\nNow, considering the rules of public conduct: both parties were using electronic devices in a public space. The lady was violating the norm by not using headphones, which is expected in such settings. The author's initial response was polite, but copying the lady's behavior by playing loud music is a form of escalation. Even though the author was pointing out the lady's mistake, retaliating with the same behavior isn't appropriate. It's a form of passive-aggressive retaliation rather than a constructive resolution.\n\nSo, while the lady was indeed at fault for being loud, the author's response of playing loud music themselves crosses into rude behavior. The author could have continued to ignore the lady or addressed it without matching her actions. By doing the same, the author didn't resolve the issue but instead caused conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation with the same behavior they were criticizing.\n"
