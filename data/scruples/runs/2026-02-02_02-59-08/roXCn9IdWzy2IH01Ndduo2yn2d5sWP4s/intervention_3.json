Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict in an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, the older lady is using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed disruptive in a public space. The author initially tries to ignore it by using earbuds, which is a reasonable response. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her politely, pointing out the hypocrisy. The woman then insists she has the right to watch her show without headphones.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. The author, in response, plays a music video full volume on their own device. This action mirrors the woman's behavior but in a more aggressive way. The question is whether this retaliation makes the author wrong. \n\nLegally, in public spaces, it's generally expected that people use headphones to avoid disturbing others. So, the woman was already in the wrong by not using headphones. The author's initial response was to politely confront her, which is understandable. However, when the author then plays a loud music video, they're essentially doing the same thing they criticized the woman for, just in a more obvious and perhaps more confrontational manner.\n\nThe key point is that while the woman was wrong to watch without headphones, retaliating by doing the same doesn't resolve the issue constructively. It escalates the conflict and could be seen as equally inconsiderate. The author might be trying to teach a lesson, but in public spaces, mutual respect and de-escalation are important. By matching her behavior, the author could be seen as being at fault for contributing to a disruptive environment. So, while the woman was wrong first, the author's response might not be justified. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
