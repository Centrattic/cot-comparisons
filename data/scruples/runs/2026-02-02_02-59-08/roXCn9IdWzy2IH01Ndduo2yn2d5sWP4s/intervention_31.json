Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is at an airport, and an older lady sits next to them and watches a show loudly. The user puts on earbuds to ignore it but then makes a phone call. The lady interrupts the call, asking them to be quiet. The user responds by pointing out that the lady is being rude by not using headphones. Then, the user sarcastically says they're wrong and proceeds to play a loud music video on their iPad, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think. Initially, the lady was indeed being rude by not using headphones. The user's first response was to tell her that her behavior was rude, which is a valid point. But then the user goes a step further by playing their own music loud after sarcastically agreeing that they're wrong. That seems like a tit-for-tat response. Even though the lady was in the wrong first, retaliating by being equally loud is not a good solution. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding with the same behavior escalates the conflict. The user could have handled it more calmly, maybe by apologizing and explaining the rules again, or just ending the call. Instead, they chose to give her a taste of her own medicine, which is not appropriate. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a similar rude manner.\n"
