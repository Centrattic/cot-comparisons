Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady watching a show loudly on her iPad at an airport, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in return.\n\nFirst, the lady is being disruptive by not using headphones, which is generally considered impolite in public. The author initially tries to ignore it and uses earbuds. When the lady confronts the author during a phone call, the author points out the lady's own rude behavior. The lady insists she's right, and the author sarcastically agrees and then plays loud music in retaliation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. While the author was correct in pointing out the lady's mistake, retaliating by playing loud music is a form of escalation. Public spaces require mutual respect, and even if someone is rude, responding in kind can be seen as equally rude. The author didn't just defend their right to make a call but took it further by actively disrupting the lady in the same way. That's a tit-for-tat approach, which might be considered poor etiquette even if the initial action was justified. So, the author's action, while understandable in frustration, crosses the line into being rude themselves. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
