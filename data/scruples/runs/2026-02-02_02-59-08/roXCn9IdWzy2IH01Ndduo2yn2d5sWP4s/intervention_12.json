Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by playing a music video loudly in retaliation.\n\nFirst, the woman's action of watching a show loudly in public is rude, as public spaces often expect quieter use of devices. The author's initial response of using earbuds is reasonable, as it's a common way to avoid disturbances. However, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author's response escalates the situation. \n\nThe author could have calmly reminded the woman that loud devices are inappropriate in public, but instead chose to play a video loudly in retaliation. This action mirrors the woman's behavior, which is the \"taste of her own medicine\" mentioned in the title. While the woman started the conflict, the author's response is equally obnoxious and unprofessional. \n\nEven though the woman was the initial offender, the author's choice to retaliate with the same behavior isn't justified. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding in kind doesn't resolve the issue but rather escalates it. The correct approach would have been to address the issue without mirroring the offensive behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their retaliatory action.\n"
