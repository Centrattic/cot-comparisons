Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her, pointing out that her loud behavior is rude. The woman responds by saying she's in her right, and the author sarcastically agrees, then plays loud music on their own device, causing the woman to storm off.\n\nFirst, the woman's initial action of watching a show loudly in public is indeed impolite. Public spaces generally expect quiet use of devices, so using headphones is common etiquette. The author's response to the interruption was to explain why the woman's behavior was rude. However, the author then takes it a step further by playing loud music in retaliation. Even though the woman was in the wrong, the author's action of playing music full volume is also a breach of public conduct. Retaliation with similar or worse behavior doesn't make it right. The proper approach would be to address the issue politely and, if necessary, involve airport staff. The author's action could be seen as equally rude, even if it was a form of payback. So, the author is in the wrong for responding with their own loud behavior, even if the woman started it.\n"
