Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person in an airport who's annoyed by a woman watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it but then, when the woman interrupts to ask them to be quiet, the author responds by playing a music video loudly themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The woman is using her iPad without headphones, which is disruptive. The author uses earbuds for a phone call, which is polite, but then when confronted, they retaliate by playing loud music. The author claims that the woman's behavior was rude, which is true because public spaces require consideration for others. However, the author's response of playing loud music is also rude and escalates the situation. \n\nThe key here is whether retaliation justifies the action. Even if the woman was being inconsiderate, the author's response of playing loud music is equally inconsiderate. The author's argument about the woman's right to enjoy her show might be valid, but using that right to disrupt others is not acceptable. So both parties are at fault, but the question is who is in the wrong. The author's action was a direct provocation, leading to the woman storming off. While the initial issue was the woman's loud show, the author's loud music was a calculated act to \"get back\" at her. \n\nIn public spaces, both sides should use headphones. The author's choice to play loud music after being asked to lower their phone call is a breach of etiquette. Even if the author felt justified, their action was not the appropriate response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a way that disrupts the same environment they were complaining about. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
