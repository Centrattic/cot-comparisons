Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about an airport incident where a woman was watching a show on her iPad loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence of events. The older lady sits next to the author and plays her show loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the author makes a phone call, the lady interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loud behavior, which is actually rude. The lady insists she's right, and the author then plays a loud music video in response, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual rudeness. The lady is being disruptive by not using headphones, which is a common courtesy in public spaces. The author, when confronted, defends himself by pointing out her behavior. However, instead of resolving the issue politely, he retaliates by playing loud music. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants a second opinion. Let's consider both sides. The lady was indeed at fault for not using headphones. The author was also on a phone call, which can be considered acceptable if done quietly. However, by playing loud music after the confrontation, the author escalated the situation. Even though he was responding to her behavior, retaliation with loud music is not a constructive solution. It's a tit-for-tat response that probably caused more disruption. \n\nIn public spaces, the expectation is to be considerate. While the lady was in the wrong first, the author's response was equally inconsiderate. He could have handled it by politely asking her to lower the volume or using earbuds himself. Instead, he chose to match her rudeness, which isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, even though the lady started it, the author's actions were also wrong because he didn't resolve the situation maturely. Both parties contributed to the conflict, but the key is whether the author's final action (playing loud music) was wrong. Since it was a direct retaliation and caused further disruption, the author is in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
