Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, he responds by playing a music video full volume and causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, the lady was using her iPad loudly in public. The author, instead of confronting her, chose to put on earbuds, which is a reasonable response. When the lady interrupts the author's call, the author's retort is to play music loudly as well. Now, the question is whether this retaliation makes the author wrong.\n\nLegally, in most public places, including airports, there are rules about using headphones or keeping noise levels down. The lady was violating that by not using headphones. However, the author's response was to play music full volume without headphones, which is also a violation. So both actions are against common etiquette and possibly the airport's policies.\n\nThe author's action was a form of retaliation. While the lady was indeed being rude, responding in kind doesn't make the author right. The appropriate response would have been to politely ask her to lower her volume or use headphones, maybe even direct her to the airport's rules. Instead, the author took a confrontational approach, which escalated the situation. This could be seen as uncivil and possibly even rude themselves. So even if the initial provocation was from the lady, the author's choice to retaliate in a similar fashion is not justified. The author could have handled the situation more calmly and respectfully. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
