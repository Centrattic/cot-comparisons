Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing in this airport situation. The scenario is that a woman is watching her iPad show loudly, and the author, after being asked to be quiet during a call, retaliates by playing a loud video. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence. The lady is being loud with her iPad. The author puts on earbuds, which is a reasonable response. Then when the author makes a call, the lady interrupts, asking him to be quiet. He politely points out her loudness. She insists she's right. Then he plays a loud music video, leading her to leave angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public behavior and mutual respect. Both parties are engaging in disruptive behavior. The lady is using a public space without headphones, which is generally frowned upon. The author, in turn, after being told to be quiet, does the same by playing loud media. Even though he might have a point about mutual rudeness, his retaliation escalates the conflict. \n\nIn public spaces, people are expected to be considerate. The lady's initial action is rude, but the author's response is also inappropriate. Retaliating with loud noise isn't a good solution. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. While he was defending his actions, his response was equally rude, which is why the lady left. \n\nSo, even though the lady started it, the author's reaction is not justified. Both acted inconsiderately, but the author's action is a direct provocation. Therefore, the answer would probably be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
