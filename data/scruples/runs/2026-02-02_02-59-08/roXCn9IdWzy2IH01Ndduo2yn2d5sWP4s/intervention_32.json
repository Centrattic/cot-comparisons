Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport, and the woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author confronts her about the volume. The key point is the author's response.\n\nThe author says the woman's behavior is rude and that using headphones is standard. The woman then accuses the author of being rude. The author admits fault sarcastically, then retaliates by playing a loud music video. The woman storms off. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The initial issue is both not using headphones. The author uses earbuds for their call, which is good. But when the woman interrupts, the author's response is a bit confrontational. However, the author's point about public volume is valid. But then, the author's retaliation by playing loud music is the main issue here. \n\nRetaliating by making the same mistake (not using headphones) is problematic. Even if the author believes they're teaching a lesson, it's still a violation of the same rule. So, the author is in the wrong because their action was equally rude, regardless of the initial conflict. The sarcasm and then the loud music escalate the situation unnecessarily. So, the answer is A.\n"
