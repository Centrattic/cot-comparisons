Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a person in an airport dealing with an older lady who's watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it, uses earbuds, then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out her loudness, then plays a music video full volume, causing her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed disruptive in a public space. The author tried to handle it politely first. When the woman confronted him, he defended his call but also pointed out her behavior. Then he escalated by playing music full volume, which is similar to what she was doing.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. Both were being loud, but the author took it a step further by intentionally mirroring her behavior. While the woman's initial action was rude, the author's response might be seen as taking it too far. Even though he had a point about her volume, playing the music video full blast could be considered an overreaction. It's a form of tit-for-tat, which might not be the best approach but might be seen as even in terms of accountability.\n\nHowever, in public spaces, both parties have a responsibility to be considerate. The author's initial response was to put earbuds in and then make a call. The woman interrupted, so the author's response was to point out her loud behavior. Then he escalated by playing music, leading to her leaving. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his action was a fair response. Since he acknowledged her right to enjoy her show but then mirrored her behavior, perhaps he's not in the wrong because he called out her behavior before retaliating. Alternatively, maybe he should have handled it differently without escalating. But given the context, he might be justified in showing her the consequence of her actions.\n"
