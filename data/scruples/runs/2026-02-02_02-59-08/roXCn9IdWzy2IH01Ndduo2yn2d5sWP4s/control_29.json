Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores her and puts in earbuds. Then when the author makes a phone call using the earbuds, the lady interrupts to ask him to talk quietly. He responds politely, pointing out that her behavior is actually rude and suggests she should use headphones. She argues she has the right to enjoy her show, and he sarcastically agrees that he's wrong and plays a music video on his iPad full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about public etiquette and retaliation. The lady was indeed being loud in a public space, which is generally frowned upon. The author's initial reaction to ignore and use earbuds is reasonable. But when she confronts him, he was polite in pointing out her mistake, but then he escalates the situation by playing his own video loudly. Even though he was responding to her rudeness, retaliating in the same way might not be the best approach. \n\nSarcastically agreeing and then playing the video full volume could be seen as mocking her or taking the conversation to an extreme. Public places have noise policies, and while the lady was at fault first, the author's action of deliberately breaking the same rule he criticized her for might make him equally at fault. It's a case of \"fighting fire with fire,\" which often backfires. \n\nSo, even though the lady started it, the author's response was a direct and possibly disproportionate retaliation. He could have handled it differently, like moving seats or speaking to an airline staff member. His action caused her to get upset, so he might share some responsibility. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
