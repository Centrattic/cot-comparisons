Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about an airport where someone is being loud on their iPad, and the author responds by playing music loudly as well. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, the older lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially tries to ignore it by using earbuds. Then the lady interrupts the author's phone call, asking them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out the lady's loud behavior, which is actually rude. The lady insists she's right, and the author then plays a music video full volume, leading the lady to storm off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public conduct and mutual rudeness. The lady started by being loud without headphones, which is indeed rude in public spaces. The author's initial response was to politely explain that the lady's behavior is the issue. However, when the lady still insists the author is wrong, the author retaliates by playing loud music. \n\nNow, retaliation with loud music is also rude. Even if the lady was being inconsiderate, the author's response escalates the situation. Both parties have a responsibility to be considerate in public. While the lady was definitely in the wrong first, the author's action of playing loud music is equally rude and not a appropriate response. Instead of escalating, the author could have addressed the issue calmly without matching the lady's behavior.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable as a form of getting back at the lady, are still inappropriate. Public spaces require mutual respect, and retaliating with the same rude behavior doesn't solve the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their response.\n"
