Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author (AITA) puts in earbuds and then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts and asks him to quiet down. He responds by pointing out her loudness and then plays a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if the author's actions were in the wrong. Let's break it down. The initial issue is the lady's loud show. The author uses earbuds to block out noise, which is a reasonable first step. Then he makes a phone call. The lady interrupts him, which is a problem because phone calls can be disruptive, but he might have a point about her being loud without headphones.\n\nWhen he responds, he tells her that her behavior is rude for not using headphones. That's a valid point since in public spaces, people are expected to use headphones for audio. However, his response might come off as confrontational. But then he plays a music video on his device without headphones. That's the key action here. Even though he was annoyed, retaliating by playing loud audio himself is a form of escalation and isn't appropriate. \n\nThe question is whether his retaliation makes him in the wrong. The lady was inconsiderate by not using headphones, but the author's response of playing loud music is also inconsiderate. Public spaces require a certain level of mutual respect. Even if someone is being rude, responding with the same behavior doesn't solve the problem and can be seen as equally rude. The author could have chosen to just ignore her further or report her to airport staff instead of retaliating. By doing the same, he mirrored her inconsiderate behavior, which is why he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
