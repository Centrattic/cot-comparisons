Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for retaliating against the woman who was being loud on an iPad in an airport. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman sits next to the author, watches a show loudly without headphones. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call (which is presumably at a normal volume), the author responds by playing a music video full volume on their own device. The woman reacts angrily and storms off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about public etiquette and appropriate responses to disruptions. Both parties are in a public space where noise can be an issue. The woman's use of her iPad without headphones is indeed disruptive, as public spaces typically expect people to use headphones for audio. The author's initial response was to use earbuds, which is a reasonable way to handle such a situation without confrontation.\n\nWhen the woman interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds in kind by playing loud music. Here's the conflict: while the woman was wrong to disrupt the author's call, the author's retaliation by playing loud audio is also a form of disruption. Instead of escalating the situation, a better approach might have been to continue using earbuds or politely address the issue without reciprocating the noise.\n\nThe author's actions led to the woman storming off, which suggests that the retaliation was effective but perhaps unnecessary. The question is whether the author's response was justified. While the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones initially and for interrupting the call, the author's choice to retaliate in the same manner is also problematic. Public settings require mutual respect, and responding with the same disruptive behavior undermines that respect. Thus, the author's action, though a form of poetic justice, is not the appropriate way to handle the situation. The correct approach would have been to maintain composure and avoid escalating the conflict.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they responded in a way that mirrored the initial disruption, leading to further conflict rather than resolving it peacefully.\n"
