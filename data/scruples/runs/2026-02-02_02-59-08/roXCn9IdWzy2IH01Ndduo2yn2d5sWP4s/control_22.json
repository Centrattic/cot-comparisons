Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman watching a show loudly on her iPad in an airport, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in retaliation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public spaces. Generally, people are expected to use headphones to avoid disturbing others with audio devices. The older lady was being loud, which is rude. The author initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds, which is a reasonable response. When the lady interrupted the author's phone call, the author politely explained that she was the one being rude. \n\nBut then the author went a step further by playing a music video loudly. This action mirrors the lady's behavior, but the author did it intentionally to teach a lesson. The key question is whether this retaliation crosses the line. Even though the author's action was a form of \"taste of their own medicine,\" it's still a public disturbance. The lady had no right to be loud, but the author's response also disrupts others. Both actions are against social norms, but the author's action was a direct and public act of retaliation, which could be seen as equally rude. \n\nSo, while the lady was initially at fault, the author's response might not be justified. The author could have handled it without mirroring the rude behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation instead of finding a more constructive solution.\n"
