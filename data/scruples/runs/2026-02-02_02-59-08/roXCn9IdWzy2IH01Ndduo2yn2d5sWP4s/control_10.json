Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores her but then uses earbuds for a phone call. The older lady interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds politely but then retaliates by playing a loud music video, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about public etiquette and mutual respect. Both parties had a complaint. The woman was being loud, which is generally considered impolite in public spaces. The author, in response to her interruption, chose to play loud music as a form of retaliation. \n\nEven though the author was initially in the right to use earbuds during a phone call, his response might have been excessive. While the woman was wrong for watching without headphones, the author's action of playing loud music full volume could be seen as equally rude, if not more so. The author's intent was to give her a taste of her own behavior, but that doesn't justify making the situation worse. \n\nPublic spaces require consideration for others, so both parties failed to act appropriately. However, the author's retaliation might have crossed the line. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he escalated the situation instead of maintaining composure, it's possible he is at fault here. But the woman started it by being loud. Still, responding with similar behavior might not be the right approach. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting someone on the phone is rude, but so is playing media loudly. The author's response could be seen as a justified form of teaching a lesson, but in practice, it's more about mutual rudeness. However, since the author took the action that directly led to the conflict, he might be in the wrong. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, considering that the woman was the initial offender, maybe the answer is B. But the author's choice to retaliate is what caused the woman to leave, so he's equally at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
