Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author first ignores her and puts in earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman interrupts and asks him to be quiet. The author responds politely but argues that her loud behavior is actually rude. He then mockingly plays a loud music video on his iPad, causing the woman to leave in anger.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. The woman was indeed being inconsiderate by using her device at high volume in a public space. The author had the right to ask her to be quieter. However, when she criticized him, his response of playing loud music on his own device is where the issue is. Even if he was right about her actions, retaliating in kind by creating noise himself might not be the right approach. Public spaces require mutual consideration. While it's reasonable to address someone's disruptive behavior, responding with the same level of disruption could escalate the situation unnecessarily. The author's actions, though a form of \"taste of his own medicine,\" might be seen as equally rude. So, even if the woman was wrong first, the author's reaction could be considered inappropriate because it mirrors the behavior he criticized. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
