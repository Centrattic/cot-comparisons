Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad at a loud volume. The author puts on earbuds but then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts the call, asking him to be quiet because she can't hear her show. The author responds by pointing out the loudness of her iPad. Then, the author decides to play a music video full volume on his own iPad, causing the woman to leave angry.\n\nFirst, the initial issue is about public etiquette. In public spaces like airports, it's generally expected to use headphones for audio. So the woman was being rude by not using headphones. The author initially tried to ignore it and used earbuds, which is correct. Then he made a phone call, which is different from playing audio. Phone calls are more disruptive because they're one-sided and can be louder, but they're still allowed in public. However, when the woman complained, the author's response was to point out her behavior, which was justified.\n\nBut then, the author takes it a step further by retaliating. Instead of just using earbuds for his own device, he plays a music video full volume. That's where the problem lies. Even though the woman was being rude, the author's response of playing loud music is also rude and escalates the situation. Both parties were being disruptive, but the author's retaliation was unnecessary. The author didn't need to reciprocate the noise; he could have just used his earbuds. So, while the woman started it, the author's action was still wrong because it was a deliberate act of revenge, not a reasonable response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
