Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a conflict in an airport over loud noises.\n\nFirst, the older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the woman interrupts, asking him to be quiet. The author responds politely, pointing out that her behavior is actually rude. Then he pretends to agree, takes out his iPad, and plays a music video full volume, causing her to leave in anger.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. Public spaces do require consideration for others. The woman was being inconsiderate by playing her show loudly, which is a common issue in shared spaces. The author's response was to match her rudeness by playing loud music, even after agreeing to be polite. \n\nWhile the woman was initially at fault, the author escalated the situation by retaliating in kind. Even if he was defending his point, using the same rude behavior undermines his argument. It's about maintaining respect and not responding with similar incivility. So, even though the woman started it, the author's retaliation makes him equally responsible for the conflict. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
