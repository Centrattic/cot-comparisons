Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the narrator responds by playing a music video loudly after being scolded. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The older lady is using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed disruptive in a public space. The narrator initially tries to handle it by using earbuds and ignoring her, but when confronted, they respond by playing loud music after agreeing to be polite.\n\nThe key here is mutual disruption. The lady was being inconsiderate by not using headphones, but the narrator's retaliation is also inconsiderate. Even though the lady was the first to be rude, the narrator's response is equally rude. So, the question is about whether the narrator's action was justified as a form of giving her \"a taste of her own medicine.\"\n\nIn terms of social norms, while the lady was wrong, retaliating by playing loud music is not a constructive solution. It escalates the conflict rather than resolving it. The narrator's approach could be seen as tit-for-tat, which is a common reaction but not necessarily the right one. Legally, both parties might have the right to use their devices, but socially, both are inconsiderate. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about social etiquette than legal rights. \n\nSo, while the lady was the initial wrongdoer, the narrator's response also breaks the same social rule. Therefore, the narrator is also at fault for their reaction. The correct answer would be that the author (narrator) is in the wrong (A) because their retaliation was equally disruptive and inappropriate, even if the other person was initially wrong. It's about mutual inconsideration, and both parties acted rudely.\n"
