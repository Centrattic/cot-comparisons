Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call, the author responds by defending themselves and then plays a music video full volume, causing the lady to leave in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the etiquette here. Public spaces like airports typically expect people to be considerate of others. The lady was using her iPad at a loud volume, which is generally seen as inconsiderate. The author's initial reaction of putting in earbuds is a reasonable way to avoid conflict. \n\nThen, when the lady interrupts the call, the author points out the lady's loudness as the issue. The lady's response is to assert her rights, which might be her way of standing up for herself. However, the author then escalates the situation by playing a music video full volume. This action directly mirrors the lady's behavior but in a more confrontational way, which could be seen as a prank or a form of retaliation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's retaliation was justified. While the lady was indeed being inconsiderate, the author's response of playing loud music intentionally could be seen as a form of revenge or a way to teach the lady a lesson. However, this method is likely to be perceived as childish or aggressive, even if it's a mirror of the original behavior. Public retaliation like this disrupts the environment and could cause further conflict. \n\nLegally, both parties might have the right to be in the airport, but social norms dictate mutual respect. The author's actions, while possibly motivated by a desire to correct the lady's behavior, crossed into acting out the same inconsiderate behavior they were criticizing. This could be seen as the author being in the wrong because they took it too far, even if their initial complaint had merit. \n\nSo, considering the escalation and the intent to retaliate, the author is in the wrong. They could have addressed the issue without reciprocating the loud behavior. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
