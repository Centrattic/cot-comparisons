Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, he's interrupted by the woman asking him to be quiet. He responds by pointing out her loud behavior. She defends herself, and he then plays a music video full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both parties' actions. The woman was indeed using her device at a high volume in a public space, which is generally considered rude. The author tried to address this politely, pointing out that using headphones is the norm in such settings. However, when the woman dismissed his feedback, the author escalated the situation by playing loud video, which is a direct retaliation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a justified form of \"giving her a taste of her own medicine.\" While the woman's initial behavior was inconsiderate, the author's retaliation could be seen as equally rude. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding to rudeness with similar actions doesn't resolve the issue constructively. Instead, it escalates tensions and creates a hostile environment.\n\nEven though the author had a valid complaint, the method of addressing it by playing loud media might not be the appropriate approach. It's possible that a more effective resolution would have been to continue using earbuds and avoid engaging further, or perhaps to ask an airport staff member to intervene if necessary. The author's action, while perhaps intended as a lesson, crosses the line into disrespectful behavior. Therefore, the author's actions were inconsiderate and retaliatory, making them at fault.\n"
