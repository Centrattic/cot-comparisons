Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is at the airport and a woman is watching a show loudly. He puts on earbuds and ignores it. Then, when he makes a phone call, she asks him to be quiet. He responds by pointing out that her behavior is rude, and then he plays a loud music video in response, causing her to storm off.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual rudeness. The woman was using the public space in a way that disrupted others (loud iPad), which is generally considered impolite. The author's initial reaction was to use earbuds and ignore her, which is a reasonable approach. However, when she confronts him during his phone call, he responds by escalating the situation by playing loud music, which is a direct retaliation. \n\nEven though her actions were rude, the author's response of playing music full volume is also rude and escalates the conflict. Retaliation in this way isn't just responding to her behavior but creating a new disruption. The author's actions were not a passive or polite correction but an active, public retaliation that likely caused more discomfort to others around them. \n\nSo while the woman was initially at fault, the author's response was equally inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation with his own rude behavior.\n"
