Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the story is wrong for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: A woman is at the airport, watching a show on her iPad loudly. The narrator initially ignores it and puts in earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts him during a phone call to ask him to be quiet, he responds by playing a loud music video on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nStarting with the woman's actions: playing media loudly in public is generally considered rude because it affects others. The narrator first tries to avoid confrontation by using earbuds, which shows some restraint. Then, when the woman rudely interrupts his phone call, he confronts her politely but is dismissed. \n\nThe key point is the narrator's response. After the woman accuses him of being rude, he retaliates by playing loud music to mimic her behavior. While this might be seen as poetic justice, it's also a form of retaliation. Even though the woman was in the wrong, the narrator's action could escalate the situation and isn't a mature way to handle it. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some contexts, public noise is frowned upon, and using headphones is expected. The woman's actions were indeed rude. However, the narrator's response, while humorous, could be seen as equally rude. It's a cycle of escalation.\n\nLegally and socially, both might have a case. The woman has a right to enjoy her entertainment, but in a public space, considerate behavior is expected. Similarly, the narrator's phone call is a common activity, but the woman's interruption was rude. \n\nHowever, the narrator's retaliation crosses a line. Instead of resolving the issue, he turns the tables in a way that causes her to leave in anger. While it's a form of karma, it's still an aggressive response. Public decency requires considering others' comfort, so even if the woman was wrong, the narrator's actions might not be justified.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the woman started it, the narrator's action was a form of retaliation that's not socially acceptable. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Maybe some would argue it's justified given her behavior. However, the general consensus on politeness in public would likely side against the narrator's response.\n"
