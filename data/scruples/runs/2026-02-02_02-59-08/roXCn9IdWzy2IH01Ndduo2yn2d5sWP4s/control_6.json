Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores her, uses earbuds, and then makes a phone call. The woman interrupts to ask him to be quieter. The author responds politely but points out the irony of her being loud. Then he plays a music video loudly on his own device, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, public spaces usually have etiquette about noise. The woman was being inconsiderate by playing her show loudly, which is rude. The author tried to address it politely, which is reasonable. When the woman criticized him for the phone call, the author's response was to reciprocate the noise. This is where it gets tricky. While the woman was wrong, the author's retaliation by playing loud music might escalate the conflict. However, since the woman initiated the rude behavior, the author's actions could be seen as a justified response to her behavior, even if it's not the most mature reaction. But from a strict standpoint, both are being inconsiderate, but the woman started it. The author's action was a direct response to her, so maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, using the same rude behavior might not be the best solution. But considering the context, the author is responding to her initial rudeness, so maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
