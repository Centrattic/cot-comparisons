Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an older lady using her iPad loudly at the airport, and the author responding by playing a music video loudly as well.\n\nFirst, the lady is watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores it but then uses earbuds to listen to a phone call. The lady interrupts and tells the author to quiet down. The author responds by pointing out the lady's loud behavior and then decides to play a loud music video as a form of retaliation. The key here is the author's response after agreeing that they were wrong.\n\nThe author starts by acknowledging the lady's complaint and apologizing, but then takes an action that's equally disruptive. Even though the lady was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's retaliation isn't a proportional or polite response. Public spaces require mutual respect, and while both parties made mistakes, the author escalated the situation instead of de-escalating it. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author chose to retaliate in a way that's as disruptive as the lady's initial action, their response is inappropriate. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their retaliation was not a mature or respectful response to the situation.\n"
