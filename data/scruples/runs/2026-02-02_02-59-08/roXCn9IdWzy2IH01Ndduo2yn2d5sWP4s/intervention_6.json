Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves an older lady watching a show loudly on her iPad in an airport, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume on their own device after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The lady was clearly being disruptive by watching her show at a loud volume without headphones. Public spaces often have etiquette where people are expected to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The author initially tried to be polite by putting in their earbuds and ignoring the noise. When confronted, the author pointed out the lady's behavior as rude and explained the social norm of using headphones.\n\nThen, when the lady insists she's right and the author apologizes sarcastically, they take out their iPad and play a music video full volume. This action is a direct retaliation, which escalates the situation. The author's response mirrors the lady's behavior, but in a public space, this kind of payback might be seen as equally rude, if not more so, because it's intentional and targeted. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is the principle of reciprocity and social norms. While the lady was indeed at fault, the author's response could be seen as taking the situation too far. Public places require a certain level of civility, and even if someone else is being rude, retaliating in kind might not be the appropriate response. The author's action might be justified as a form of teaching a lesson, but it's still an escalation that disrupts others. \n\nHowever, from another angle, the author was defending their right to make a phone call, which is a common activity in public spaces. They might argue that the lady's interruption was uncalled for, and their response was a proportionate reaction. But given that they used a music video which is more disruptive than a phone call, it's possible that their action was more harmful. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"giving someone a taste of their own medicine\" is often used to describe such situations. Whether it's justified depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. In many cases, retaliation isn't encouraged because it perpetuates a cycle of rudeness. The author's action, while perhaps intended as a lesson, might be considered equally inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's behavior was a form of retaliation that escalated the conflict. Even if the initial issue was the lady's fault, the author's response crossed into being rude themselves. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for their retaliatory action.\n"
