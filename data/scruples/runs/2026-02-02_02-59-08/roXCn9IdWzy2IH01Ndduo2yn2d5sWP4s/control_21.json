Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show on her iPad loudly. The author, instead of confronting her directly, decides to play a music video full volume after being told off. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The older lady was being disruptive by watching her show loudly in a public space. The author tried to ignore her at first, even using earbuds to avoid the noise. Then when the lady interrupted the author's phone call, he politely pointed out her behavior. She responded by accusing him of being rude.\n\nThe author then sarcastically agreed with her, saying he was wrong, and then played a music video full volume. The woman then left in anger. The key points are: public noise etiquette, mutual rudeness, and escalation of conflict.\n\nIn public spaces, people are expected to respect others' comfort. The lady was violating that by not using headphones. The author's initial response was to point that out politely. However, when she dismissed his point, he retaliated by playing his own loud media. This seems like an escalation. Even though the lady was in the wrong for the initial noise, the author's retaliation may be considered equally rude. Both actions are disruptive. \n\nSo, while the lady started the problem, the author's response was also disruptive and unprofessional. The appropriate action might have been to continue ignoring her or to use higher authority if necessary. Retaliating with loud noise is not a solution. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation, even if the other person was initially at fault.\n"
