Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone being disturbed by a loud iPad in an airport. The author initially ignores the noise but then uses earbuds to make a call. When the lady interrupts them, the author gets defensive, argues, and then plays a music video loudly on their own device, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The lady is using her iPad loudly, which the author finds rude. The author responds by making a phone call, which the lady interrupts. The author then argues, points out the lady's rudeness, and retaliates by playing music loudly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPublic spaces like airports generally have rules about noise levels. Using headphones is common to avoid disturbing others. The lady not using headphones is indeed rude, as she's affecting others. However, when the author used earbuds to make a call, that's typically acceptable because earbuds are for personal use and don't disturb others. The lady interrupting the call might be overstepping, but she's pointing out the noise from her own device, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's response is where things get tricky. While the lady was wrong for using loud speakers, the author's argument is valid. But then the author takes it a step further by playing a music video loudly in retaliation. Even if the author is right about the lady's behavior, retaliating by creating loud noise themselves is also rude and against the same rules they're criticizing. So the author's actions mirror the lady's, which is hypocritical and escalates the conflict. \n\nSo, even though the author had a point about the lady's initial behavior, their own action of playing loud music is also wrong. The correct approach would be to politely ask the lady to lower the volume, use headphones, or report to airport authorities if necessary. Retaliation with the same behavior isn't appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their own actions, even if the lady started it.\n"
