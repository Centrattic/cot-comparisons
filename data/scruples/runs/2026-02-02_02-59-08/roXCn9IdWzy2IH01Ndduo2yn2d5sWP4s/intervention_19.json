Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is at an airport, there's a lady who's watching her show loudly on an iPad. The author is there and initially ignores it by putting in earbuds. Then the author makes a phone call, and the lady asks them to be quiet. The author responds by pointing out that the lady's own volume is rude and then, in a sarcastic way, plays a music video loud on their own device to mirror her behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but is asking for opinions. So, first, I need to consider the norms of public spaces. Typically, in places like airports, people are expected to use headphones if they're watching videos or shows, to avoid disturbing others. So the lady's behavior is indeed rude. The author, by using earbuds initially, was trying to avoid being a disturbance. Then when the lady interrupts the call, the author points out the hypocrisy. \n\nBut when the author responds by playing loud music in retaliation, that's a problem. Even if the lady was wrong, the author's response escalates the situation. The author's action of playing loud videos is also a disruption, so they're mirroring the same behavior they criticized. That's a form of revenge, which isn't really solving the problem but just creating another issue. \n\nSo while the lady was clearly in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's retaliation makes them equally at fault. The author could have just continued ignoring the situation or politely reminded her again without matching her behavior. By playing loud music, the author crossed the line into being rude themselves. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here because they responded in a way that's just as disruptive as the lady's initial behavior.\n"
