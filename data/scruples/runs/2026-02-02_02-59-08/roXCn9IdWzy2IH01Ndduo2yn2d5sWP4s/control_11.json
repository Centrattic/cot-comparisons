Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person at an airport dealing with a woman who's watching a show loudly. The author initially ignores her, then when she interrupts him during a phone call, he responds by playing a loud music video. The question is whether the author was wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the etiquette in public spaces. Generally, people are expected to be considerate. The lady was using her iPad loudly without headphones, which is typically considered rude. The author tried to address it politely when she told him to quiet his phone call. He calmly explained that her behavior was the issue. Then, when she continued and he felt she wasn't respecting his phone call, he retaliated by playing loud music. \n\nSo, the key points here: both parties are being rude. The lady is being inconsiderate by not using headphones, and the author, even though he started off politely, escalated the situation by playing loud music himself. His response was a direct provocation, which is not the right way to handle a conflict. Even if he felt she was wrong, responding in kind doesn't make his actions right. Retaliation often makes things worse and isn't considered acceptable behavior in public. \n\nThe author might have felt justified, but the appropriate action would be to either ignore her further or perhaps report the situation to airport staff rather than escalate it. By playing loud music, he mirrored her inconsiderate behavior, making him equally at fault. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he chose to retaliate instead of maintaining his own etiquette.\n"
