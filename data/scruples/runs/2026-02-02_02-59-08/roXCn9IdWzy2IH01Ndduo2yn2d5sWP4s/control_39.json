Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being told to quiet down.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The older lady sits next to the author and watches a show loudly. The author initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when the lady interrupts the author's phone call to ask to speak quietly, the author responds by pointing out that she's being rude and then plays a loud music video in retaliation.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. Public spaces have norms about not disturbing others. The lady was indeed being rude by not using headphones, but when confronted, the author escalated the situation instead of resolving it. The author's response of playing a loud video is a form of tit-for-tat retaliation, which might not be the best approach but is it wrong?\n\nLegally, everyone has the right to enjoy their own devices, but in public spaces, there's an expectation of courtesy. The author's initial reaction was to point out the lady's rudeness, which is valid. But then, instead of just ending the call or using headphones, the author chose to play loud music as a form of payback. This action could be seen as equally rude and disruptive. So even though the lady started it, the author's response might cross the line into being inconsiderate as well.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's retaliation was appropriate. While the lady was wrong first, the author's response was not a measured or polite solution. It was a direct and equally loud response, which might make the author at fault for not finding a more appropriate way to handle the situation. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for escalating the conflict instead of de-escalating it.\n"
