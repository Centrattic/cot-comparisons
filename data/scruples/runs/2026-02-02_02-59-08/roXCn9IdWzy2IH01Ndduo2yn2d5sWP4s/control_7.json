Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author did the right thing by playing a music video full volume after the older lady complained about his phone call. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman was watching her show loudly on an iPad at the airport. The author, annoyed, put in earbuds. Then when the woman asked him to quiet his phone call, he told her that her behavior was rude. She responded by saying she had the right to enjoy her show. Then the author played a music video full volume, causing her to leave angry.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about public etiquette and retaliation. The woman was indeed being disruptive by watching something loudly in a public space where headphones are expected. The author was within his rights to point that out. However, when she complained about his phone call, even though her own behavior was louder, he escalated the situation by playing music full volume, which is also rude. \n\nSo even though the woman started it, the author's response was a form of punishment or getting back at her, which isn't really solving the problem. The right approach would be to address the issue calmly, maybe ask her to lower her volume again or involve airport staff if needed. By retaliating, the author mirrored her loud behavior, which isn't appropriate. \n\nTherefore, even if he felt she was wrong, responding in kind made him equally at fault. So the answer should be A, because the author took it too far by retaliating instead of handling it politely.\n"
