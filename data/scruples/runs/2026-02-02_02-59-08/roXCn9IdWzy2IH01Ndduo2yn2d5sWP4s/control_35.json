Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is at an airport. A woman is watching her show loudly on an iPad. The author is nearby and initially ignores it by using earbuds. Then, when the woman interrupts the author's phone call to ask to speak quieter, the author responds by pointing out that the woman isn't using headphones, which is the rude action. Then the author decides to play a music video loudly on their own device, leading the woman to get angry and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public behavior. In public spaces, people are generally expected to use headphones to avoid disturbing others. The woman's loud show is indeed rude, but the author's response to play music loudly seems like a tit-for-tat retaliation. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were appropriate. While the woman was in the wrong for not using headphones, the author's response was to escalate the situation by doing the same thing. This could be seen as a form of revenge rather than a calm resolution. Even though the author pointed out the woman's mistake politely at first, playing loud music in retaliation isn't a public behavior one expects. It's a hostile reaction that leads to the woman storming off, which the author might have intended for comedic effect, but it's still a breach of social norms.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they took a confrontational action instead of finding a peaceful solution. Even if the initial complaint was valid, the method of response was excessive and unprofessional, leading to escalation. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
