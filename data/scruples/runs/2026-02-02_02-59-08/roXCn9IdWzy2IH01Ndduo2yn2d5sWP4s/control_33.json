Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dispute in an airport where a woman is watching her show loudly, and the author responds by playing a music video full volume after being reprimanded.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman was using her iPad without headphones, which is indeed rude in a public space. The author initially tried to ignore it and then used earbuds while making a call. When confronted, the author defended their actions and then retaliated by playing a loud video. \n\nThe key points are about public etiquette and mutual respect. While the woman was at fault for not using headphones, the author's response of playing a loud video full volume is also a form of retaliation that disrupts others. Even if the author was pointing out the woman's mistake, responding in kind isn't appropriate. The author's action could be seen as equally rude, so they might be in the wrong for escalating the situation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was just giving her own behavior back, but generally, public decorum requires maintaining civility. So, the author's actions might not be justified even if the initial behavior was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they retaliated in a way that's also disrespectful.\n"
