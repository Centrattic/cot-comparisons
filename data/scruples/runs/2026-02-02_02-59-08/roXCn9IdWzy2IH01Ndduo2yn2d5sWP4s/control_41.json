Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman complaining about a loud iPad in the airport. The author responds by playing a music video loudly in retaliation. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The woman was watching a show loudly, which is generally considered rude in public spaces. The author initially tried to handle it by putting on earbuds, which is a reasonable first step. Then, when the woman interrupted the author's phone call, they confronted her politely. \n\nBut here's the twist: when the author responded by playing a loud music video, that's a clear escalation. Even though the woman was at fault first, the author's retaliation might be seen as equally rude or even more so. Public spaces have norms about noise, and while the woman violated those, the author's response could be viewed as an overreaction. \n\nHowever, there's a debate here about whether the author was justified in showing the woman her own behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, both might have the right to use their devices, but socially, the author's action is a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. \n\nMost people would likely say that responding with the same behavior isn't the right approach. The appropriate response would be to politely ask the person to lower the volume, not to retaliate in kind. Therefore, even though the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's actions cross into being rude as well. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response was an escalation that's socially unacceptable, even if the initial behavior was also wrong.\n"
