Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author puts in earbuds and ignores it. Then the woman interrupts the author's phone call, asking him to be quiet. The author responds by telling her that watching shows loudly is rude and then plays a video at full volume, causing her to storm off.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about public etiquette. The woman was indeed being disruptive by watching her show at a loud volume without headphones. That's generally considered rude in public places because it affects others. The author's initial reaction was to use earbuds, which is a common way to avoid such disturbances. \n\nBut when the woman interrupted the author's call, he responded in kind by playing a video loudly. Even though he had a point about her behavior, retaliating by doing the same thing he was upset about might not be the best approach. So while the woman was at fault for the initial behavior, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author's actions led to an escalation. Instead of addressing the issue politely and perhaps asking her to lower her volume, he used her own behavior against her. This might be considered a form of revenge, which could be seen as wrong because it's not productive and could cause unnecessary conflict. \n\nHowever, the author did point out the inconsistency (she was being rude but expected him to be quiet) before retaliating. But the act of playing the music video full volume is similar to her behavior, which was the issue in the first place. So even if he was correcting her, his method might still be wrong because he mirrored her actions, thus also being disruptive.\n\nIn public spaces, the expectation is mutual respect. The woman's actions were wrong, but the author's response could be seen as equally rude. So while the woman was in the wrong initially, the author's retaliation might also be considered wrong because it disrupted others as well. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation with his own loud behavior.\n"
