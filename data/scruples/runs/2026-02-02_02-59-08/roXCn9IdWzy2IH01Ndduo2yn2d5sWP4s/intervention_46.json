Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an airport where a woman is watching a show loudly on her iPad, and the author responds by playing a music video loudly in retaliation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions from both sides. The lady was being inconsiderate by watching her show at a high volume without headphones. The author initially tried to ignore it by using earbuds and then made a phone call. The lady then complained about the phone call, even though she was the one causing the disturbance. The author's response was to play a music video loudly, leading to the lady leaving in anger.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual inconsiderate behavior. The lady was clearly at fault first by not using headphones. The author, instead of escalating, tried to reason politely. However, when the lady continued to be rude, the author's retaliation, while perhaps not the best approach, was a direct response. The question is whether this retaliation makes the author wrong.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for playing the music video? Well, both the lady and the author were in public spaces where using headphones is expected. The lady violated that norm first. The author, in response, also violated the norm but in a way that was a direct reaction to the lady's initial rudeness. However, retaliating by playing loud media could be seen as equally inconsiderate, even if it's a form of \"taste of their own medicine.\"\n\nBut the situation is tricky because both parties are violating the same social norm. The lady started it, but the author's response might be seen as a justified escalation in a public setting where others are also affected. However, the author's action could also be seen as a form of revenge, which isn't typically encouraged even if the initial wrong was the other person's.\n\nIn many cases, public etiquette expects people to use headphones, so both are at fault here. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. The author's retaliation, while possibly proportionate, might still be considered wrong because they took the same inconsiderate action. However, given the context, some might argue that the author was correcting the behavior by showing the negative impact of loud devices.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether retaliation is considered the wrong approach. If the author's action is seen as a direct and proportionate response to being unjustly criticized, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the action is considered equally rude regardless of the context, then the author is at fault. Given that both violated the same social norm, but the lady started it, the answer might still be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as they mirrored the inconsiderate behavior to make a point, even if it's a bit of a harsh method.\n"
