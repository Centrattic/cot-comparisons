Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The scenario is at an airport, which is a public space. The older lady is watching a show loudly. The user initially ignores it and uses earbuds. Then, when making a phone call, the lady interrupts to ask him to be quiet. \n\nThe user responds politely but points out her own loud behavior. Then, as a retort, he plays a music video full volume on his iPad, causing her to storm off.\n\nFirst, consider the actions: both parties are in a public space where noise can affect others. The lady's loud iPad use is disruptive. The user's phone call might be normal, but he's using earbuds, so maybe not the issue. But when he's asked to quiet down, he responds by doing the same thing she did\u2014playing loud media. \n\nPublic spaces often have rules about noise. Using headphones is expected to prevent disturbing others. The user, after being confronted, instead of just stopping his call or finding another way to handle it, retaliates by being loud. This could be seen as equally inconsiderate. Even if the lady was wrong, his response mirrors her behavior, which might not be acceptable. \n\nAlso, the user initially used earbuds, which is the right approach. His retaliation undermines that. So while the lady was at fault first, the user's response might put him in the wrong too. So maybe answer A.\n"
