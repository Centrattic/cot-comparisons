Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is at an airport where an older lady is watching a show loudly on her iPad. The author is using earbuds and ignores it. Then when the author makes a phone call, the lady asks them to talk quietly. The author responds by pointing out that she's being loud and should use headphones. Then the author pretends to agree and plays a music video full volume, causing the lady to storm off.\n\nFirst, let's break down the actions. The lady is indeed being inconsiderate by watching media at a loud volume in public. The author initially ignores it, which is a reasonable first step. When the lady confronts the author about the phone call, the author responds by pointing out her own behavior. That seems fair because the lady's action is also rude. However, the author then takes it a step further by playing a loud music video in response, which is meant to mirror the lady's behavior.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's retaliation is justified. The lady was wrong for not using headphones, but the author's response of playing loud music is a form of revenge. Even though the author was polite in the argument, the action of playing loud media is equally inconsiderate. So while the lady was at fault initially, the author's reaction crosses into the same behavior they criticized. The author's intent was to teach a lesson, but that doesn't make the action right. Public spaces require mutual respect, and responding with the same behavior undermines that respect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for retaliating in a way that matches the initial offense.\n"
